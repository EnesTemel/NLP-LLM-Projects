1;Mini;2023 Mini Countryman;2023 Mini Countryman Untamed edition - BEST interior ever! REVIEW;car enthusiasts we've all had our fair share of positive and negative experiences with car enthusiasts that's the thing with owners they're always passionate about what they drive and and sometimes it can become a little bit toxic however there is one group of people who I've always had a positive experience with and that is mini enthusiasts because whether you've got a 500 pound mini one that you bought off of marketplace or a top of the range mini gp3 every mini is welcome in the community and they celebrate the diversity of both their members and their cars and that is why I'm so excited to have another mini on the channel my mini videos always do really well because I think you guys can feel how much I really love this brand yes they have their flaws and I will talk about that but overall I can't help but fall in love with all the cars that I drive the mini Countryman was launched in 2010 and it was a way to keep owners in minis when they outgrew their small three-door hatchbacks and they needed something with a bit more space they create the mini Countryman that meant that all of these owners could stay in their beloved minis but they're now much more practical for families alike throughout the years there's also been a ton of special editions some of my favorites include there was the Goodwood Edition a collaboration between Minnie and the Rolls-Royce design team red white and blue models for the 2012 London Olympics and a pat Moss Edition to celebrate the legendary female rally driver however Minnie's latest edition is this one this is the mini Countryman Untamed Edition and in today's video I'm going to tell you what makes the Untamed so special but also just My overall feel on the mini countrymen in its latest third generation so if that sounds good then please do keep watching and guys if you do like reviews like this please please please go ahead and hit the Subscribe button things slowed down a little bit I feel like I'm not pushing you guys hard enough but please if you are watching this go ahead and hit the Subscribe button okay so first let's talk about the exterior details that you get with the Untamed Edition the Untamed Edition is a trim line which is dedicated to the mini Countryman and it aligns with everything the Countryman stands for The Clue is in the name country this vehicle is supposed to give you a sense of adventure that you can tackle all terrain however the mini Countryman has never actually been a very good off-roader in fact it was one of the first glorified SUVs it almost started the trend and let's face it most people who buy mini countrymans don't need them to go across muddy Fields you go for something with a full all-wheel drive system however the Untamed edition of this car does get the addition of minis all four system which makes it a little bit better at tackling all terrain I'll talk about that when I I drive it but first of all design you get this really nice Bluey gray paintwork or you can also have it finished in white both colors look really nice with the contrasting elements and that includes a contrasting black gloss Grill black badges black light surrounds Wing mirrors and also door handles and roof you also get some limited edition 18 inch alloy wheels which have been designed for this car I will say that if you are someone who has a lot of fights with curbs these are a pretty busy design so they might get expensive when it comes to repairing them you also get some decals which just finish off the look of the mini Countryman Untamed Edition and if you look around the car you've got some badging you've got a little plaque on the front here which is actually 3D printed and you've got some badges in the rear quarter and on the back my only problem with these Untamed badges is they just look a little bit like aftermarket stickers that you get from car shows I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing but for some people that may not be to their taste however it'd be very easy to remove those small decals now where this car gets really really special is inside the interior is really very special and it's what's made me fall in love with this car so much you get some very very nice high quality leather seats and they're those classic Mini seats with loads of intricate details they're finished in a very nice dark green leather and then you've got the contrasting Fabric in the middle and you've also got some piping finished in light blue this piping around the seats also matches with some of the plastic around the dash and I love the design of the dash it's finished in a mountainous design so you've got that stacked layering of different Grays it's just very pretty and this in fact also lights up at night so it looks really good whether it's the daytime or the night time you've also got that mountainous design in little pins which are on the sides of the seats it feels very high quality and very special you've got a nice leather wrapped armrest which actually features some wireless charging it's got all the wonderful details which are so iconic to mini and it includes these heavy weighted almost fighter jet buttons you've got that fantastic glowing start stop button which I love so much and then you've got your physical climate control dials which just always feel really good quality and they make using them when driving easy and that's a good thing because one thing which isn't so easy to use when driving is the touchscreen this trim level can be specified on a few different engines so you've got the entry level Cooper which has around 140 brake horsepower you've got the sportier Cooper S which I've got today which gets around 170 brake horsepower and feels much more nippy underfoot [Music] I always forget how much I enjoy driving minis obviously I'm spoiled for choice and I get to drive some really cool cars and I kind of forget how good these things are and I think yeah Minnie's all right I like Minis there's a very big track to come in about to let him have his moment but I really do forget how fun these cars are to drive and I'm not kidding you for the first time in a long time including things like the Mustang convertible this is a car that I'm gonna really miss because it just feels like the ultimate daily for me personally I know that SUVs aren't everybody's taste but I've always quite liked an SUV loved my Volkswagen T-Rox and actually I feel a bit bad for not convincing my mum to go and drive one of these before she opted for the t-rock because yeah I really like this you have that combination of the space you sit up higher you've got the all four system which I'll speak about in a moment so that's going to get you out of some sticky situations but you've got all the sportiness of the best minis so this has the Cooper S engine and that means it's got 192 brake horsepower which is a lot really isn't it I mean yes it's not like a performance SUV like something like the t-rock r or the Audi sq2 but it does feel super sporty you've got a great noise which comes from the exhaust the steering is really really well weighted and I have to say the highlight of this car for me is this automatic gearbox I don't know if it's because I've just come off of the back of having the Mustang convertible and the 10-speed Ford automatic terrible it was so laggy it was kind of you could feel it changing this is so very smooth when you're in sport it changes at the right times when you want it to change it gives you that really good noise from the exhaust but it changes up when you want it to doesn't leave it hanging like some other cars and then when you're in Eco it's so smooth you barely feel the changes at all it's just a very very good box and I guess maybe I'd forgotten that after all BMW and mini do create very good automatic gearboxes and I do have to keep remembering that as much as I'm falling in love with this car it is expensive it is one of the most expensive when you compare engines and specs to some of its competitors but I think if you love a mini it's worth splashing out on what I want to know is did the person who had the idea of Union Jack rear tail lights get a pay rise because these are some of my favorite modifications to the new generations of minis they really Elevate the car and they just give it such a strong brand presence I really really like them if you go for the Cooper S version of the mini Countryman Untamed you also get a pair of twin tail pipes which is always nice and they sound pretty good as well which I'll show you in a moment now inside the boot you get a decent amount of luggage base and the boot in general is just very practical it's a nice and wide opening and this boot floor is quite low as well so whether you're loading in items you're getting dogs in the back or you're putting push chairs in the back it's really easy to load all of your luggage I do think we're quite spoiled nowadays when it comes to rear interior space in electric cars because you forget when you're in a petrol car you need to have a transmission tunnel and that instantly makes leg room for the middle seat passenger a little bit more tricky to navigate although space in the back here is not too bad I think even on Long Journeys people who weren't too tall would be nice and comfortable the quality is all still spot on back here as well I am obsessed with this leather interior it's so pretty I love the contrasting green and the light blue you've also got electric windows and two USB slots the mini Countryman itself sits at the higher end of the SUVs on sale today with prices for the Cooper classic starting from a little under thirty thousand pounds or the cheapest Untamed starts from around 4 000 pound more however the lovely details like the two-tone Wheels the Highland Green Leather is all included and options like Sat Nav keyless entry carplay sensors and heated seats are all standard but that does put it in direct competition with premium Rivals like the BMW X1 Audi Q3 and Alfa Romeo tonale not that any of those cars has the kind of personality of the Mini so I mentioned at the beginning that the mini Countryman is fitted with the all four system and that it wasn't a real off-road four-wheel drive system and I guess that's a little bit mean that's not giving credit to mini because it is a good system but what I mean by that is though it does have the ability to move all four wheels it doesn't do it all the time it's always kind of focused on that front-wheel drive but also there's no modes like rocks because essentially with the body kit on this thing it has got good ground clearance but it's not great ground clearance so it's not set up like an off-roader is anybody surprised no not really but in terms of how the all all four system works is when it senses that the car is beginning [Music] my God we've had tractors we've had ambulances everything today when the car senses that some of the wheels are starting to slip so if the front wheels are starting to slip it will send up to 70 of the power to the rear wheels to unstick you and it'll also kind of just balance out between the front and rear axle the power delivery so it gives you the best possible chance of tackling things like ice and snow of course I haven't been able to have a chance to actually tell how this works but you can tell that by the way it sticks around corners the way that it handles then it will be pretty robust but of course you can't go comparing it to something like a Land Rover Defender despite what the name might suggest and the addition of all four the mini Countryman Untamed isn't exactly an off-roader but then again anyone that knows their minis knows that these cars were not really designed for that they're designed for Adventures perhaps more adventures in a city and it's really good at doing that I've had a fantastic time with the mini Countryman untamed and I think that interior is really really very special it's made me fall in love with this car I think I've said that three times now but it's true the interior really does make you feel like it's worth spending that extra money over some of its Rivals which are a little bit more boring on the inside but let me know what do you think in the mini Countryman Untamed Edition should they have made this be able to scale rocks and go over mountains yeah it's really not necessary is it but if you think it is let me know in the comments down below if you've enjoyed this video as ever please go ahead and give it a big thumbs up and if you want to see more videos like this then please do go ahead and hit the Subscribe button until next time bye [Music] thank you

2;Mini;2023 Mini Countryman;2023 Mini Cooper Countryman is it the better small suv?;the fun to drive spirit of suvs are now here many of wesley chapel has given us the 2023 mini cooper s countrymen in your midnight black 2 signature trim all new design was last year this year it's going to add a untamed edition which that package will add gray metallic paint with piano black exterior highlights on the s and the hybrid trim inside the funda drive suv receives updated tech sports seats the larger cooper goes against rivals like your mazda cx-30 your volvo xc40 even the honda hrv that's been redesigned but is this one going to be more athletic a fun to drive kind of like a go-kart or a rally car i'm anthony from hawkeye rides and i'm going to go over all the specs and details starting out [Music] the new mini cooper s countryman is bigger the front's going to stress a clean look with less parts added the iconic grille it's bigger than before thicker start to a thinner exterior giving a motion appearance as it stays still and it gives us an insert for the chrome and it flows into your led headlamps corner lights and your fog lamps that are led on the lower trim the air inlets for the brakes highlighted in black is going to surround the front wheel well with 18 inch pair spoke wheels the famous side scuttle led turn lights the side skirts are going to receive the silver that's going to flare out the rears cleaned up as much as possible focusing on the lower bumper part with the gloss black in your dual exhaust outlets making the exit look more simple and plain with the new led union jack tail lights and the iconic chrome that surrounds the whole vehicle to keep the iconic mini styling it's not going to be the longest the widest tallest it's going to be less than the volvo xc40 they're going to set it up with a strut front suspension a multi-link rear both the front and the rear will have a coil spring disc reading behind the front at 13 inches the rear is at 11 both ventilated appearing this to the rivals this has the iconic styling in a heritage history whereas you don't have the same in the cx-30 the hrv or even the xc40 a linked at 168.5 inches with a wheelbase at 105.1 inches we do have the roof racks which gives us more capabilities to do some fun playful things clean and simple and that's what we're looking for we also have the best in class for cargo so going inside at 17.5 cubic feet you're going to get some storage compartments on the side you'll have your 12 volt charger you have a storage tray underneath the bottom the rear bench split folds to a 40 20 40 split maxing the cargo to 47.9 cubic feet towing over 3 300 pounds a payload over 800 pounds the current weight to this is just a hair over 3 500 pounds so when you have that small of a vehicle and you have this much capacity to actually do things it's something nice with the reverse camera reverse parking sensors this is a twin power turbo vehicle let's go inside start it up so we can hear that exhaust now [Music] the throaty exhaust note that you get out of this little engine is insane because again you have to consider the rivals are going to be heavier they're going to be longer this is still a big vehicle for many however it's not as big as the rivals they back the performance of the 2.0 liter mini twin power turbo four cylinder producing 189 horsepower and 207 pound feet of torque that's paired to a seven speed steptronic dual clutch automatic transmission achieving 24 to 33 mpgs let's go for a 0 to 60 around 6.8 seconds which is quicker than the honda hrv and the mazda cx-30 the base engine trim quarter mile at 15.2 seconds which is faster than mazda and honda and the top speed is faster than all of them 135 miles per hour that's insane for something that weighs just a touch over 3 500 pounds you have technology styling i mean this is definitely a fun adventure vehicle and it more or less drives like a rally car and yet it's an suv let me know in the comments what you think about the 2023 mini cooper s countrymen as we go into the interior go over the tech and take this for our test run entering inside the mini cooper s countrymen you're going to receive 40.2 inches of head 41.4 inches of leg carbon black leatherette seating they're heated manual adjustment for the front seats which i get it we're trying to save weight there's sports front seats so i do like that the dashboard simple modern you got the gloss black for all of your air vents and surrounding the lower lip new decor elements to keep a flat surface mini reduces the amount of switches and buttons to the center display with a new look and feel in the infotainment 8.8 touchscreen with navigation we have the pinch we have the swipe this has apple carplay am fm hd radio xm streaming bluetooth audio standard is a six speaker we have the upgraded harman kardon click into the app so you can see everything we have we do have amazon alexa to click into your driving mode you will start off with the green your mid and then you got your sports mode which is going to be for your dynamic and you can configure this which is really cool because when you click on the drivetrain or chassis you'll see a little go-kart or a rocket the same thing is going to be for the chassis not on the drivetrain so i do like the playful attributes they put switch to reverse you have full trajectory it doesn't cover the full screen but you have your sensors on the left side so it does make it relatively easy for your reversing dual climate control settings you'll also see that around the gauge cluster when you turn to heat or cold you'll see it turn red or blue when you're coming close to an object it will also turn red so i like all this funness that they're throwing inside because you don't get that with the mazda you don't get that with the volvo and you don't get it at all with honda as well the focal point though for a mini cooper is the steering wheel focused on a modern flat black high gloss multi-button structure and this is a leather wrap sports design three spoke dynamic digital cluster that is attached to it and you can go through an array of information more or less on the bottom as you're seeing me toggle it through otherwise changing your driving mode will change the color in the center cluster elbows are going to be more firm to ride open up in here and you're going to have some storage this also folds back and you got more storage you can also adjust this to make it better for someone like me because i'm six foot three i like that we have the rally toggles underneath the dual climate control settings because it gives us that heritage you got a 12 volt usb you have a storage tray cup holders 16.9 ounce fits without any issues the 20 ounce is probably going to be close to max the gear lever i do like that with the leather that's around it it's going to be more of a matte black around it with the eyedropped mouse it's non-touch however you can roll it if you need to i mean this is a touch screen infotainment and it has voice recognition why do you need it it's just for somebody that wants to play around door panels are going to have more harder materials on the top but this is a mini cooper harman kardon upgraded sound system you're going to get that gloss black that's going to surround it one touch up and down for all your windows and the storage pocket is the largest you can fit a lot of 16.9 ounce water bottles comparing it to the rivals more storage in this and the way it's designed headroom is the best in class dual moon roof let's see how look in the back for the back seats 38 inches of head 34.3 inches of leg i can fit pretty decent you do sit up more and you're kind of more inside there isn't anything here unless you find this little switch fold it down and see what i mean and now you have a harder substance but at least you have an arm rest i would probably leave it up though and when you put it up this is actually the seat dimensions so we have them already folded back almost all the way these are all the way so you get the dimensions you have your two air vents in the center gloss black around it two usbc ports storage behind both of the front seats non-flat floor but this is a smaller suv and you can still fit a lot of space and what they do is they put it on the door panel harder materials on the top i like that you receive the gloss black in the back and you get the speaker trim it's going to be harder surfaces one touch up and down and the storage pocket is huge just like the front maybe five 16.9 ounce water bottles comparing it to the rivals this actually has more storage than volvo xc40 let's see how look in the center sitting into the center headroom is not necessarily an issue legroom i'm kind of grazing the back of the front seats in the position that i'd be sitting i'm going to be sharing significant space for feet but shoulder space however if i'm comparing it to the mazda cx-30 this is going to be better and more optimal in the center the honda hrv was refreshed 10 inches longer than it was in the prior generation so you can actually fit in the center and the volvo xc40 is not necessarily too bad either because they're both box structured suvs but this one because of the 60 40 60 split i actually feel like i'm fitting more in the center than i do in the rivals but the fun to drive spirit you actually feel it back here because the way the windows are structured and because you really know that you're in a mini even in the back seat so they do an excellent job just keeping you in that trim level whereas when you get to the other brands you're looking for more of a luxury or some upgrades mini just keeps it simple and smooth let's see how that drive is taking the 2023 mini cooper s countryman now for our test run 2.0 liter mini twin power turbo with a little less than 200 horsepower i mean you're at 189 horsepower 207 pound-feet of torque the seven-speed steptronic dual clutch transmission is really where it's at because that's going to make it a lot more aggressive the weight to this just around 3 500 pounds for the curb weight so it's a light vehicle as you're driving it it's gonna feel a little bit more sport tuned as well especially with that dual clutch transmission being in there you will notice it right away and what i do like about it is it keeps that heritage of the go-kart and that's exactly what you're looking for with this vehicle when you're comparing it to the rivals you don't really have that fun spirit you just have turbo that's all they stress this stress is more of a fun to drive vehicle we're going to set it up straight we're going to put it in manual so we can see how it is stop in the middle of the road here we go it's going to get loud inside and comparing it to the rivals it probably will be the loudest but the fun to drive spirit you're not going to get too much of that until you go into the mazda cx-30 turbo engine and that one has a lot more power but then the price also escalates to more as well red light green light turn radius check at a stop point it's gonna get about two and a half lane here we go it's just fun in nature it is a lot louder you don't feel like you're riding on the ground so i do feel like i'm lifted up pretty decent the shifting on the transmission is good i like the paddle shifters i do wish that they were not such plastic but i understand because we're around 37 000 price points you're not really going to expect it to be like fully luxury or see some aluminum here and there and brakes it's not bad either you have good visibility too because you do sit up enough the a-pillars are pushed back because it's more of an oval structure to the front wind screen and looking at the back windows you can actually see all the way back if you need to otherwise use your blind spot monitoring now there is three things i like three things that i dislike is anything more than that i'd be taking this mini cooper home the three things that i like is you still have the same driving dynamics and when i say you still have that bmw took it over you know so you're not expecting to get all of the iconic styling and yet that drive of mini you're expecting it to be more grown up and they keep the same attributes of many which is hard to keep when you are changing all the dynamics of the vehicle to make it more improved to bmw standards the second thing that i like about the vehicle is how much space you have cargo is insane when you compare to any of the rivals even if they're longer you still have more cargo capacity more storage in the door panels or pockets it's just great that they give you all of this in a daily use vehicle plus just give it a little gas and it's fun to drive liven it up and look i mean cornering abilities you can do a light maneuverability with the vehicle it's not going to be full-blown sports car spec but that's the fun thing about a mini footer and sport here we go it's definitely a fun car the last thing that i like is how they pay attention to detail when you're in this price point typically a vehicle doesn't put that much emphasis on looking at details and what they do with many on the interior and on the exterior just putting all these different simple touches and yet making it still blend to the iconic mini styling that is something that sets it apart from the rivals the second thing that i dislike about the vehicle is the air that circulates inside it you have to put this thing on medium to high all the time if you leave it sitting out in the sun it takes a long time to cool off the vehicle in a hot area and then take back to the mazda 3 hatchback it has the same problem the last thing that i dislike about the vehicle is a two part it's the tailgate and the back seats the reason for both of them is you have to have the key fob in your pocket in order to open the tailgate unless you pop it here then you got maybe five ten seconds to open it real quick then you have to almost slam it to close it the back seats you have to go outside go inside to the rear and pull the lever down it's a lot more work than the rivals and i wish they would have cleaned that up just a little bit because this is the suv of mini and it just makes it a little bit less quickness in the sense of if i need to throw something in really quick i gotta open the tailgate oh i forgot my key i gotta go inside get the key open the tailgate go open the back seats it's just more work what i do like about the countryman is that we have an alternative for the mini you can get a mini cooper s and it's going to be more sporty you get a convertible or a hard top and then you can get the countryman and you got the suv so you have all capabilities to get yourself in the mini line when you go into mazda convertibles the only one that you're going to get is the mx-5 when you go into honda i mean it's not going to be as playful as the mini when you go into volvo it's going to be more grown up in luxury so this actually fits itself in a different class category in my personal opinion and i like it because of the fact that it's unique and yet you have the dynamics you have the fun to drive you have the sportness even in the interior you're not going to really receive any of that until you start going into a 40 plus thousand dollar price point and mini backs it underneath that level i like to thank many of wesley chapel for giving us this 2023 mini cooper s countryman for our car review if you're already a subscriber thank you for being part of the hawkeye community if not click the next video the subscribe button check out the details the merchandise the website and everything we do here at hawkeye and to show you for maneuverability the best part is this is not a top-heavy vehicle so you can have some actual funness with it and when you do it you can see how it stays planted on the road this is an suv they did dynamics for that and look if i need to do a quick wrap around you can do so the fun to drive go-kart vehicle is still here
3;Mini;2023 Mini Countryman;2023 Mini Cooper S Countryman: Start Up, Test Drive & In Depth Review;hey everyone how's it going thanks so much for tuning in today we're going to be taking an in-depth look at the 2023 Mini Cooper S countrymen this particular mini actually belongs to my wife so big thanks to her for letting me borrow it for a while we both love Minnie's I've had a few myself over the years but it's been a long time I mean it's been years since I've had a mini featured on the channel so I've been really looking forward to bringing this video to you guys it's gonna be a lot of fun as with all of my reviews I'm going to cover all of the ins and outs and take this thing on a thorough drive I'll also get a bunch of sound clips there's a whole lot of stuff to cover so without further Ado let's go ahead and start her up and let her run [Applause] thank you foreign [Music] the mini Countryman is currently in its second generation which launched for the 2017 model year it competes in the premium compact crossover segment and as many as most popular offering the Countryman has a unique place amongst its competitors with an expressive retrofuturistic design impressive driving Dynamics and loads of personalization and premium amenities the Countryman was most recently refreshed for the 2021 model year in the few model years since changes have been minimal and largely pertained to equipment changes colors and special editions this generation is a bit larger than its predecessor so there's more passenger and cargo room but proportionally I think the dimensional changes dramatically improved overall Aesthetics this generation also saw the introduction of a new range of powertrains plus further refinements to the optional all four all-wheel drive system despite being the Brand's largest vehicle offering the countrymen is still instantly recognizable as a mini it features design elements that are typical of the brand including a clear three-way structure when looking at it from the side as well as short overhangs large wheel arches and a downward increase in width precise Contours across the surfaces create an attractive play of light and shade that underscores the athletic shaping in the upright stature of the body this generation also goes further in terms of the countryman's versatility agility and premium character redesigned front and rear bumpers lend more refined appearance than in years prior the redesigned radiator Grille features hexagonal Contours that are typical of many and it's surrounded by a slim lined one-piece Chrome frame the grills air intake is subdivided by three horizontal struts on the Cooper on the Cooper S The Grille has a bold hexagonal Grille pattern with a red s and a single Chrome strut the redesign of the front fascia also added standard LED headlights the distinctive asymmetrically rounded Contours of the headlights are accentuated by continuous band of light that takes on the function of both daytime driving lights and turn signals turning light included in the functional range of the headlights provide clear illumination of the side areas of the road when turning or changing lanes LED fog lamps are also standard featuring a light band in the upper semi-circle of each fog lamp that serves as a parking light the rear fascia also enhances the more powerful and contemporary look of the countrymen with redesigned bumper trim all rear lighting functions feature LED technology as standard while the graphic structure of the taillights reflect the pattern of the Union Jack paying homage to Mini's Origins as a distinctively British brand the piano black exterior option which is now available on all countrymans finishes the headlamp surrounds rear lights radiator Grille and side indicator scuttles and high gloss black instead of chrome along with the door handles and the model lettering on the luggage compartment lid additional identification features in high gloss black are available from the range of original Mini accessories 2024 models now starting to roll out the Countryman is available in four models the thirty two thousand six hundred fifty dollar Cooper the thirty two thousand nine hundred dollar Cooper S the 42 700 Cooper SE all four plug-in hybrid and the forty three thousand eight hundred dollar John Cooper Works all four the all four all-wheel drive system

finished in sage green metallic and accented by a white roof white mirror caps and white Hood stripes the iconic trim is offered with a choice between nine body colors the roof and mirror caps can also be had body colored but you can also opt for white black or silver if you wanted some extra contrast this example is a 2023 model front-wheel drive Cooper S Countryman which started at 35 500. the iconic trim was an additional 4 625 dollars additional options shown here include black all-weather floor mats an all-weather trunk mat and a mini first aid kit the total MSRP including an 850 destination charge was forty one thousand two hundred fifty five dollars the hood stripes and roof rails were dealer added accessories Cooper countrymans are fitted as standard with 17-inch alloy wheels while the Cooper S is fitted with 18 inch wheels with the iconic Trim in particular there are four wheel options to choose from including two 19-inch options these 19-inch turnstile spoke two-tone wheels are a no-cost option the tires fitted to this example are Pirelli p0225 45 summer performance run flat tires out on the road the Countryman exhibits excellent overall manners with a taunt but not overly firm ride as well as sharp handling and a connected feel all season tires are standard when opting for all-wheel drive all countrymans are offered with a temporary spare tire as a standalone option if equipped you also get a Jack and wrench when it comes to stopping power standard four-wheel disc brakes with abs and electronic brake Force distribution help bring the vehicle to a stop from 60 miles an hour and about 121 feet the pedal feel is satisfyingly firm and the brakes are quick to respond the front discs are internally ventilated and measure 13 inches in diameter while the rear discs are solid and Measure 11 inches in diameter all of the discs are clamped down by single piston calipers the suspension combines the tried and tested principle of a single joint spring strut axle at the front and a multi-link rear design with a design that's optimized for weight and rigidity as well as a model specific setup this lays the foundation for precise handling properties and maximum agility the best part is that despite being the big mini the countrymen still delivers the Dynamics you'd expect from the brand it has excellent body control even with sharp turns of the steering wheel for even higher cornering thresholds I'd recommend springing for the optional Dynamic damper control system which at five hundred dollars includes two programmed maps to alter the damping characteristics of the shock absorbers in response to driving conditions and Road quality the latest version of Mini's optional all four all-wheel drive system not only reacts quickly and precisely to changing situations but it's also Compact and offers a high level of internal efficiency it consists of a power takeoff unit integrated in the front axle differential a propeller shaft leading to the rear axle and a hang on clutch that ensures precisely measured transmission of the drive torque to the rear wheels the system's electronic control is interconnected with the dynamic stability control system so it detects any need to adapt power distribution early on in this way all four optimizes both traction and stability and adverse weather and Road surface conditions as well as ensuring improved agility when taking bins and more spirited driving the model specific electric power steering system makes the countrymen exceptionally precise servotronic speed sensitive power steering is standard which varies the level of assistance based on your speed of travel this makes low speed maneuvering easier and increases stability at higher speeds the steering ratio is 14 to 1 and it takes about 2.4 turns from Lock to lock the Turning circle is 37.4 feet the steering wheel itself comes leather wrapped on all country mounts it's a thick steering wheel with pronounced bolsters at 10 and 2 and can controls on the upper spokes to operate cruise control media and hands-free phone systems the steering wheels available heated and is manually adjustable for tilt and reach the five inch digital instrument display is also standard on all countrymens it combines the speedometer tachometer fuel readout and the driver's information system the latter is accessed by a small button labeled BC on the turn signal stalk as you'll see in just a bit the colors on the screen change in response to what drive mode you have the car set to across the model lineup the Countryman is offered with four engine and transmission combinations the Cooper is powered by a one and a half liter turbocharged three-cylinder that develops 134 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque Cooper S is powered by a 2-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that develops 189 horsepower and 206 pound-feet of torque you can consider these as the core engines of the countrymen lineup front wheel drive both of these engines are paired to a 7-speed steptronic and dual clutch transmission opting for all-wheel drive gets you an 8-speed automatic the Countryman is currently not offered with the option of a manual transmission for a serious jump in performance you'll want to consider the John Cooper Works which has a higher output version of the 2-liter engine that develops 301 horsepower and 331 pound-feet of torque it's only offered with all-wheel drive and the 8-speed transmission on the more efficient end of the spectrum the Countryman se's plug-in hybrid system consists of the turbocharged three-cylinder engine and e-drive electric motor and a high voltage battery pack the combined output is 221 horsepower and 284 pound-feet of torque and up to 25 miles of all electric range transmission for the SE is a six-speed automatic the SE is also fitted with a hybrid specific all-wheel drive system as standard it basically works by allowing the engine to power the front wheels while the electric motor acts on the rear wheels with front-wheel drive the Cooper S Countryman is able to accelerate to 60 miles an hour and about 7.2 seconds top speed is 137 miles per hour the single Twin scroll turbocharger allows for pretty quick response especially when switched to sport mode all of Mini's engines are constructed using aluminum for the block and head the latter of which integrates the exhaust manifold for more effective cooling of the exhaust gases in the turbocharging system at the same time crankcase cooling can be reduced when demand is low under partial load by means of a new split cooling system for the block fuel was delivered via high pressure direct injection there's double overhead camshafts with four valves per cylinder and variable valve time the compression ratio is 10.2 to 1. the 7-speed DCT was introduced as the standard transmission for front-wheel drive models back in 2020. again a manual transmission is currently not offered there are however panel shifters on the steering wheel if you want to manually change gears you can change gears using the electronic shift lever as well but if you simply tip it to the left while in drive and don't shift it yourself it puts the transmission into a sport mode which holds gears longer and delivers more emotive shifts compared to a conventional automatic which has a torque converter the DCT features two clutches one handling the even gears the other handling odd gears plus reverse while driving the clutches interact with each other when the car shifts which causes one of the clutches to ready the next gear before the car needs it in order to smooth out shifts and improve driving Dynamics the dct's electronic control module has been programmed to analyze the driver's habits to optimize its shifts if equipped with navigation the data is also taken into account to improve the gearbox shift strategy on all driving situations allowing it to downshift before you take a corner or take advantage of engine braking when you slow down a crawl function is also included to ensure smooth operation during traffic and low speed driving gear spacing is also broader compared to the previously used six-speed automatic so that the engine speeds are more varied for improved fuel economy the Dual clutch gearbox has been optimized to work with an engine auto start stop system in green and mid modes the transmission also has a coast function that decouples the drivetrain when you let off the accelerator allowing the car to roll at idle without any engine braking effects coasting function also takes advantage of the navigation system and the camera for certain active safety features and can automatically disable itself to utilize engine braking when taking turns or approaching an intersection the toggle switch at the base of the center stack allows you to select between three modes mid Sport and green mid is the default setting the drive modes Ultra accelerator pedal response and steering effort the operating mode of electrically powered comfort features and the engine sound as well as shift characteristics of the transmission when it comes to fuel economy a front-wheel drive Countryman is rated between 24 miles per gallon in the city and 33 miles per gallon on the highway averaging around 28 miles per gallon premium fuel with an octane rating of at least 91 is required the total tank capacity is 16.1 gallons foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] the interior of the Countryman offers excellent overall passenger space and versatility for its size both the driver and front passenger benefit from additional Head and Shoulder space compared to the previous generation while the adjustment range of the seats have also been increased the horizontal cockpit is reminiscent of the classic Mini hardtop on the expanded upon with stretch lines and generously sized surfaces in addition to the use of high quality materials and having excellent fit and finish overall the modern ergonomically optimized controls contribute to the car's premium ambiance I'm also a big fan of the little toggle switches they use in the center stack and overhead console one of my favorite things about mini is the level of personalization you have depending on the trim level you have different options available to choose between but all in all there's five different upholstery options available on the Cooper S including carbon black leatherette a combination of cloth and leatherette cross punch leather premium Lounge leather and Chesterfield leather the Chesterfield leather as shown here is distinguished by Diamond stitching across the middle of the seats with color accent stitching and piping the Chesterfield leather also offers additional colors such as malt Brown indigo blue and satellite Gray piano black interior trim is standard while illuminated piano black or eliminated shaded silver is available with the signature and iconic trams this example has the standard headliner which is similar in color to the satellite gray leather a black or anthracite headliner is also available power adjustable front seats are available on certain trims and include power adjustable lumbar support and a memory function on the driver's side heated front seats are standard along with heated mirrors and washer Jets a heated steering wheel is available as a standalone option the narrow pillars and high seating position make for excellent outward visibility when it comes to instruments the early countrymans were set up similar to other minis at the time with the speedometer in the center of the dash and the tachometer and information system on the steering column the newer generation minis have since moved on to a more modern setup of having all of the instruments on the steering column with the circular control unit now incorporating a standard 8.8 inch touchscreen infotainment system two audio systems are available including a standard six-speaker system with AM FM tuners HD radio and Sirius XM Satellite Radio a 360 watt 12 speaker Harman Kardon Hi-Fi system is also available the MINI Connected controller in the center console includes a rotary dial and shortcut buttons for various infotainment features that can help make navigating the system a bit easier the touch screen itself is very responsive with the most recent refresh the circular control unit gained a more refined appearance with the audio control panel the buttons for the hazard lights and Driver assistance systems now integrated more seamlessly with high gloss piano black touch surfaces navigation is added with the signature tram along with Advanced real-time traffic data and auto dimming rear view mirror and power folding side view mirrors MINI Connected includes a wide range of MINI Connected Digital Services and can even be used to send navigation directions from your smartphone to the countrymen the vehicle is always online enabling seamless integration of available Amazon Alexa voice assistant on the iconic tram this also provides access to real-time traffic information and internet platform and smartphone integration with Wireless Apple carplay this circular control unit is also available with an interactive and customizable LED ring that provides illumination and response to driving situations by way of control feedback when equipped it also comes with an expansive LED interior ambient lighting system and a projection of the mini logo from the exterior mirror on the driver's side when opening and closing the door a single zone climate control system is standard on the Cooper while a dual zone system is standard on the Cooper S regardless of the system equipped there's three easy to use rotary dials and buttons in the center stack the Countryman offers a lot of storage for a smaller vehicle helping optimize functionality in addition to Door pockets and bottle holders there's a fully fledged center console extending up to the instrument panel that offers a covered storage compartment that doubles as an adjustable armrest two cup holders in front of the transmission lever and a couple of additional trays in the center console with USB A and C outlets now to mention a 12 volt power outlet wireless phone charging is included with the iconic tram the charger is located inside the armrest however due to the small space it would have to be a smaller phone for example an iPhone Max will not fit even without a case the Countryman is equipped with a SIM card that's permanently installed this enables the use of intelligent emergency call with automatic detection of vehicle location and accident severity as well as many teleservices the standard rear view camera and rear Park distance control can be expanded by opt-in for the iconic tram which includes front parking sensors and a parking assistant feature for easy parallel parking optional mini driving assistant includes Collision warning with City braking function camera based adaptive cruise control pedestrian warning with initial brake function high beam assist and road sign detection active cruise control is also available as a standalone option with intelligent engine and braking control adaptive cruise control helps maintain a consistent speed an onboard camera even helps maintain a consistent distance between you and the car ahead a pretty neat head up display is included on the iconic tram IT projects a multi-color image onto a retractable tinted screen versus projecting an image onto the windshield I actually prefer this layout it's very helpful it keeps the image just below your line of vision and allows you to monitor preferred travel information mini navigation system directional arrows infotainment functions check Control Data and more without unnecessary distraction mini also offers an alarm system as a standalone option to provide additional protection for the doors the trunk lid and the hood on top of that an ultrasonic sensor provides interior protection as far as airbags there's eight in total including side curtain and front knee airbags the current generation Countryman is 7.8 inches longer than its predecessor and approximately one inch wider the wheelbase is longer by 2.9 inches the rear door openings are also larger improving the ease of Ingress and egress this growth resulted in significantly increased interior space especially when it came to rear seat leg room the countrymen can see up to five people without too much difficulty the biggest hinderance for taller folks will be the middle portion of the seat due to the height of the center floor tunnel an array of child seat anchors enable a car seat to be placed in either of the three seating positions the Dual pane sunroof opens at the front and is fixed in the rear each portion has a mesh shade that can be pulled back to filter the light while still allowing some to pass through to maintain a sense of openness for the interior the Countryman is also available without the sunroof if you prefer the base of the rear seats can slide four and aft longitudinally by up to 5 inches the backrest also reclines so you can kick back and relax on a long trip one downside is that there's no Center armrest to fold down there are however three full-size adjustable headrests that can also be folded for extra visibility when not in use I'm five foot ten inches and felt there was plenty of space overall the added adjustability definitely gives more flexibility for taller folks but all in all the Countryman offers great accommodations for this segment additional rear seat amenities include adjustable air vents in the rear of the center console two USBC charging ports large door storage Pockets front seat back storage Pockets overhead LED illumination and overhead grab handles with coat hooks rear privacy glasses available as a standalone option a power opening and closing tailgate is available as an option the tailgate is light and easy enough to open manually but it could prove to be a useful convenience if your arms are full behind the rear seat you have 17.6 cubic feet of cargo space the rear seat backrest is comprised of three sections that can not only be reclined like you saw a second ago but they can also be folded flat to accommodate many different combinations of passengers and cargo the 40 20 40 design allows you to fold down each section independently for example if you have thin long items like skis you can fold the middle section down and still have space for two rear passengers if you remove the Privacy cover and fold the rear seat completely flat you can expand the total carcass based 47.6 cubic feet that's an increase of 5.4 cubic feet when compared to the previous generation countrymen the standard storage package includes an adjustable height cargo area floor cargo Hooks and tension straps not to mention a stainless steel insert on the loading sill for a nice touch one unique option is the picnic bench which is an upholstered padded cushion that folds out of the luggage compartment that provides seating atop the rear bumper for two people while the vehicle is parked additional trunk amenities include LED lighting on either side and a 12 volt power outlet on the right side well everyone that's going to wrap it up

4;Mini;2023 Mini Countryman;New Mini Cooper S Countryman All4 Is The Perfect Car For Your Next Journey!;thank you [Music] [Music] that's better foreign not too shabby at all this in my best dug demero impression I'm just kidding this is the 2023 Mini Cooper Countryman in Nanook White and it is really sharp I was hesitant to like this color because pepper white has been a Mainstay in the mini Community but to see this color in person this new Nanook white it is very very sharp definitely more of a metallic color definitely more metallic Fleck in there but it really does look good and on this new Mini Countryman it is very very sharp with the black accents on it it just looks really cool this one kind of reminds me of a panda bear but that's a given with the coloring really sharp looking now this is a signature trim 2.0 and it's nicely equipped all four all-wheel drive black pin spoke wheels 2 liter 189 horsepower engine it has nice interior this one's really cool it has a white exterior with a white interior so that's kind of cool really really nice with the leather interior in here touch screen of course this has navigation so can't go wrong there love that and it has Apple carplay so another great feature to have really really nice overall the interior finishes are just great very comfortable very kind of cool looking I wasn't sure I would like the white on white in this case it actually works and it looks incredibly good now of course because it's signature trim it does not have a power liftgate but that's not a deal breaker here this is still easy to get access to easy to open and close not a heavy tailgate by any means and in the the trunk area you have plenty of cargo space you have a load floor that can be lifted up to get a little bit deeper cargo area and if you fold the seats flat you have more cargo space there in the back you have plenty of space for your passengers I'm only five nine so if the driver's about five nine six foot I'm actually not bad here I got plenty of space here between my knee and the back of the seats and there's also extra stuff down here there's USBC ports there's a rear vent the front passengers get adjustable lumbar which I wish I had in my car but I don't and did I also mention that if you want to sit a little bit closer to the seat in front of you you can actually reach down here and pull this lever and Slide the seat forward so that's a neat feature and it's on the other seat too so both of them have that this is a 60 40 split bench as well enough room back here for two passengers comfortably three in a pinch and up front where the magic happens you have these nice comfortable seats with adjustable thigh rests very very nice setup and heated steering wheel so that's an added bonus Digital dash when you start the car up very very nice setup here the new steering wheel is really cool I love these buttons and everything fun fact this button here Lim actually limits your top speed so if you hit about 60 miles per hour and you hit that button you cannot go any higher than 60 miles per hour so neat little trick there so if you inadvertently press this button while you're driving don't worry there's nothing wrong with the car you just limited your top speed is all now I'm not exactly sure what is going on there but it says this vehicle's mileage on this tank of gas is 527 miles which I don't think is possible now of course as I mentioned earlier we got the nice touch screen navigation Apple carplay if you have it equipped all the different settings and functions are in here all the different things you can do with the event led on the bezel you can even change it to just be a solid color very very nice climate controls are easy to use and of course we have all of our toggle switches down here including the driving mode sport Eco and mid traction control we can turn off the engine stop start so if you don't want it on you can turn it off and then of course the toggle switch to start and stop the car and for stereo we do have Harman Kardon in this vehicle so we got the speakers in the car as well as the very nice Subs underneath the seats and in case you want a little bit of sun we do have a sunroof in here Panorama of course and to reduce the glare inside the vehicle it has an anthracite headliner which I am all for because I'm not a fan of the beige headliner or the gray headliner it just doesn't look as good to me and I know I just said all four so mini pun and I did touch briefly on the exterior trim we have piano black trim pieces all around the vehicle the side scuttles the headlight Rings The Grille the badges even the tail light rings they're all done in this beautiful piano black which really sets off the features of this vehicle against the Nanook white so really really nice look even Countryman lettering in black as well and this car also has the black tailpipes which are pretty sharp looking and at thirty nine thousand dollars this is not a bad vehicle that is pretty decent money for what you're getting which is quite a lot of car and it's very fun to drive everyone thinks that 189 horsepower isn't enough for these all four countrymens but I disagree they're small they're maneuverable they're all-wheel drive that horsepower is plenty and the torque is where it's at 207 foot pounds of torque this thing gets up and goes very quickly now I will say the only thing this vehicle is missing is some Bonnet Stripes I'm thinking a nice set of sport stripes in Black going right down the middle here would really set this car off so what are my overall thoughts on new color since this is the first time I've seen it since Minnie announced it I really like it and I can see why they got rid of white silver it would have really kind of matched this color now am I disappointed they got rid of pepper white absolutely pepper white was a staple of mini ownership almost everyone you've ever talked to has owned a pepper white mini so to see the pepper white color disappear just kind of sad I think this is a pretty sharp new color out here and I think it's one that'll sell very well now as for me I'm gonna go take this car and park it back where it needs to be parked but if you like what you see check out more content on this channel at the end of this video and as always thank you so much for watching okay
5;Mini;2023 Mini Countryman;2023 MINI Countryman | Different Approach | REVIEW;[Music] don't you feel like breaking free open your eyes and Embrace what you see now don't you feel like [Music] today we have a 2023 mini Countryman for those of you who are unfamiliar with Mini's lineup the Countryman is a Sub-Compact SUV and as of now the only crossover offered by the British manufacturer the 2023 model year marks a debut of a limited Untamed Edition that you see here which includes this momentum gray metallic paint all four style exterior trim unique wheels and piano black exterior details now the Countryman has four powertrain options a 134 horsepower 1.5 liter turbo 3 cylinder 189 horsepower 2-liter turbo inline 4 21 horsepower plug-in hybrid offering up to 18 miles of electric range and a top of a line 301 horsepower 2-liter Turbo 4. the car is built on BMW's UK L2 platform shared with cars like an X1 X2 or a 2 Series Gran Coupe so we're off to a good start the chassis features McPherson struts in the front and multi-link setup in the back combined with optional adaptive dampers now before we talk how it all works together let's jump inside the Countryman and talk about the Interior Space the interior of the countrymen cannot be mistaken with any other car typically for many many elements have rounded shape and it feels very refreshing to be in a cabin that doesn't feel generic you can tell that the designers put a lot of attention to detail to make the interior feel very special and kudos to them for that the quality isn't necessarily top-notch but you do get some premium flares materials used inside are acceptable at this price point and everything is well put together the technology has been basically carried over from BMW the infotainment system is a previous generation of iDrive which means you can control it either via a touch screen or a controller placed in the center console now I'm one of the few people who actually have no issues with iDrive and for me it works well there is a little bit of learning curve but once you get used to it you will find it relatively easy to operate and a clean graphical interface helps with that Wireless Apple carplay is standard and if you opt for the iconic stream you will also get a wireless charger among other features you get a very simple non-customizable digital cluster and a head-up display the front seats are surprisingly comfortable for a Sub-Compact crossover and if you're a taller individual like me you will appreciate a low sitting position and extensible thigh support now moving to the back it's still a mini so there isn't a ton of leg room in the second row but the Headroom is pretty good and climate vents as well as two USBC ports are always nice to see lastly the trunk it offers 17.6 cubic feet of space and if you fold the back seat down that number goes up to 47.6 cubic feet alright so that was the interior of the mini Countryman let's get it on the road now and see how it drives many have always been associated with a go-kart-like driving characteristics so is that the case with the Countryman well not really it's a crossover so what you get in the first place is a well-balanced chassis with great damping and reasonable driving Dynamics since the Countryman is an SUV it's not as fun to drive as a smaller Tudor Cooper however the Adaptive dampers would stiffen up in sport mode help with eliminating some body roll and the Countryman retains a little bit of classic Mini character feeling Nimble and being engaging to drive on curvy back roads now the Cooper S variant that I tested is powered by BMW's b48 which means it's a 2-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder making 189 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque available at just 1300 RPM it's no secret that BMW makes one of the best turbo 4S and the one in the Countryman only proves that the tuning is excellent resulting in smooth power delivery and even though the car isn't crazy fast it feels quicker than the numbers suggest the all-wheel drive model gets an 8-speed conventional automatic that again typically for a BMW product has been tuned well and its logic and automatic mode is great fuel economy during my week with the Countryman I averaged 22 miles per gallon in the city 33 on Highway and 26 combined now when it comes to driver assist features the Countryman comes standard with a forward Collision warning with automatic braking Lane departure warning traffic sign recognition and rear parking sensors sadly blind spot monitoring and rear cross traffic alert are not available which I think is a joke especially considering that most mainstream SUVs or crossovers have it as standard so that was the mini Countryman with everything we covered let's jump to the conclusion the mini Countryman is a fun stylish and a practical subcompact SUV that is shockingly refined in every aspect despite the Brand's perception it feels like a legitimate entry-level luxury product that is pricey but if you're looking for something that will distinguish you from the crowd and has a character that many SUVs don't maybe besides a Bronco sport that's your only option pricing starts at 32 650 for a base front wheel drive Cooper and an all-wheel drive is a fifteen hundred dollar option for a three cylinder and 2100 for a more powerful Cooper S my fully loaded tester and iconic trim with a special Untamed edition package was priced at forty five thousand two hundred and fifty dollars it's worth noting that when you purchase or release the Countryman you get free maintenance for the first three years or 36 000 miles whichever comes first and the car is covered by a four-year fifty thousand mile bumper to bumper warranty if you have any questions about the Countryman feel free to drop a comment and I'll do my best to answer them thanks so much for watching and I'll catch you later foreign
6;Mini;2023 Mini Countryman;Why Im back in a 2023 JCW MINI Countryman!;hey guys it's Christy with motoring motivation you know the drill by now is just me my mini music and a motivational segments that I play here on the station and you're probably thinking wow did she not just say Minnie but she's got a Jeep behind her that sort of doesn't fit well that's because for the last two years my husband and I both have become a two uh many of two Jeep family that's right we both owned Jeeps I had a 2018 Jeep Rubicon Recon and my husband has this in mod process Jeep Willis and I loved the fact that both of us owned a Jeep I love the fact that we had that freedom and flexibility to take it out on the beach to go up on the trails to take the camper out and just really be kind of out in nature and really enjoying things the things that I couldn't do when I owned a mini But ultimately it became for me at least a love-hate relationship because my jeep was a daily driver and after owning it from 2021 to 23 I just had become a little bit frustrated and annoyed every time that I went up to the Gas Pump and so at the end of 2022 I took all of my receipts for Phil I tallied them up and then I averaged them out and I was spending anywhere from around 450 to 600 dollars a month in fuel and that really depended on how much I was driving it in that month where we were going because mainly because mine was newer and more luxurious we took mine most of the time but there is a price to play to pay to be able to get out and play so to speak and because uh we liked the fact that we modded all of our minis they were never the same they never stayed the same the Jeep isn't much like that which is why I think a lot of mini owners transition to them because it's saying that same quirky feel that you have and making it morph into your personality and that's what I had done with my Rubicon which is not the one that you see in the background I lifted it I had bigger tires on it I had a heavy front and rear bumper I had a roof rack on it I had a swing arm for the spare tire on the back I had the winch on it and so on and you know what that means wait more weight a lot more weight and so on and that only further decreases your fuel consumption for uh for the month it just all adds up so I think uh on the screen the last time that I checked it I was getting like 11 miles a gallon you know what the cost of fuel with it going up and down it's still very very expensive and at the end of the day I just didn't want to go into 2021 having that trailing behind me did mean you know so ultimately I made the adult decision and the most logical one um was to let my Jeep go because we still had one that we could go out and have fun in and so I decided to let mine go on to another owner that was going to enjoy it just as much as I had which put me back to trying to decide what do I want to drive I've been in the mini Community for 17 years an ironically between the classics that we've owned and the different models we've owned 17 minis to which is the length of the time we've been in the community crazy but I wasn't sure that I wanted to go back to many I just kind of was ready to break away and try something else and not get kind of Typecast for being known as the chick with all the modded out Minis so I drove a lot of vehicles what I did know was that I wanted a small SUV crossover something that had a little bit of space and flexibility for traveling and carrying things but I didn't want a very big SUV again fuel um so I looked at the Porsche Macan GTS in a used model could not get into a new one but they used ones I could get into at my price point I looked at a BMW X1 and X3 I looked at Audi and Land Rover Alfa Romeo and um Jaguar all of those as well as some American-made ones and while I was out looking I also looked to the hybrids and I looked at the electric vehicles it would not I wouldn't have done myself Justice if I didn't you know at least look at those and drive them and try to decide what I wanted to do at the end of all of this which was exhausting I finally realized what I was still oh my gosh we've got the popo coming by so I've got a loud noise so wait so ultimately what I knew that I wanted was a vehicle that was very much an extension of my personality which is quirky and fun that had some fun colors with it and that was easy to sorry I got my hand in a cast it was easy to modify and trick out that I could bring it to life in my personality It ultimately came down to actually two or three it was the Alfa Romeo the jaguar and the Porsche Macan and the BMW actually four and ultimately at the last minute I narrowed it down to BMW the only thing with the BMW is it still is more refined it was more polished it was more of that professional luxury and that's really not me I'm more quirky and fun and odd and so I loved it but I wasn't in love with it so the last ditch effort before the purchase I called my motoring advisor Michael over at flow mini in Raleigh North Carolina said hey thinking about buying a new car what you got um in the mini lineup I don't know that much about them now because I've been out of the community for a while I do know that I was would be interested in a John Cooper Works any model let me see what you got fast forward he calls me got this awesome JCW that rolled off the lot I think you would be interested how about come for a drive well folks that did it right now I am the proud owner of a 2023 John Cooper Works many countrymen and a beautiful sage green which again is outside of my comfort zone but I absolutely think it's beautiful it's uh it's kind of that chameleon color that it actually changes with the way the sunlight comes off of it sometimes it looks that very much uh greenish color sometimes it looks a bluish gray sometimes it looks like a a different kind of gray it just depends on how the light hits the metallic color but it's very much reflective of my personality and also the fact is I really miss the Need for Speed and so this can go from zero to four seconds at 301 horsepower and I think it's pretty awesome I'm actually super enjoying it and it's not burning fuel oh my gosh I still actually can have a tank uh my gas can actually go for almost three weeks that's if I if I drive it on green mode but it's still better than my jeep was so you know what I haven't had it for just actually just a little bit now but as soon as it came off the lot it didn't come the way it came you know I can't do vanilla I can't do ordinary I have to be a little bit off the chain and extraordinary so you see these my wonderful husband surprised me and he worked a deal with many behind the scenes that I didn't know about and actually bought these wheels for me which are the JCW 19-inch Pro wheels and I think they are fabulous I've actually been wanting them since I own my 2017 Clubman and I just could never justify the cause for it so that was kind of like my Valentines kind of every kind of thing present surprise all wrapped up into one and I've never cried I'm not a crier but let me tell you when I saw these on it when I went to pick it up I cried I think everybody thought they needed to call 9-1-1 because it was just that much of a surprise that my wonderful husband had done that for me and the Michael and all of them he uh Henry and Kurt all of them were working this out behind the scenes and it kind of just reminded me of it felt like coming home to my mini family and I'm so happy to be back and I'm so happy to be back on the channel and you know just keep watching because you know this ain't gonna be the same as it is now I'm gonna tweak it I'm gonna style it I'm gonna flare it I'm gonna make it be more like me so I hope that you will tune in because we'll see where this is going and oh by the way her name is Maleficent you know we gotta name the minis all right guys take care

welcome to another vlog i'm driving this this is the mini cooper s countryman john cooper works inspired model this is actually the facelift of the countrymen straight away we're going to be opening the engine bay as easy as that that is engine bit says twin turbo mini there's insulation right there and i just love the way the hood opens that cutting for the lights anyways let's close this right away okay this is heavy because of hydraulic struts but there we go now on the facelifted model they have updated the lights the grille as well as the bumper even the rear bumper and the lights have some amount of tweaks but this is the jcw inspired model which gets a sportier bumper board at the front as well as the rear you can see s written right here a lot of chrome on this car the fog lights are also quite bright and that is obviously the towing hook of the vehicle you can see a lot of insects have actually hit the number plate any which ways the lights are really very nice these are all led units in fact it says mini on the inside that is the level of attention to detail and there's a chrome surround as well this is a functional air dam aerodynamic bits on this car and of course this gray color looks fantastic but this is not the best looking mini in fact it's not even the worst looking mini because the clubman also exists somewhere in the world the wheels are actually bigger 18 inches on the jcw inspired model regular model gets the 17-incher 225 50 18 is the size of the tires you can see a lot of brake dust here and there says john cooper works on the cab too and uh you got this body cladding running throughout the car s written right there i think this is for the indicator okay it actually projects mini on the road at night chrome door handles there's a request sensor on both the sides which is actually a nice thing and this is in the higher variant you get a request sensor key let's enter or not this is actually you can see the indicator here as well which is pretty nice okay uh wipers have that dual blade treatment too okay is this a led no this doesn't seem led to me anyways you can see the length of the car it gets this black colored roof so sort of a floating roof treatment as well coming to the rear obviously you get the union jack in the lights okay the rear lights and it says mini right on the inside as well can you see that i don't know something there there it is okay and you get two proper exhaust vessel hands fingers of truth will actually hide in the pocket and uh you got sort of for diffuser treatment as well two rear requests no therefore actually on the side which is kind of camouflage in the body colliding and yeah doing hook says countryman right there that is a reverse parking camera cooper s written here mini logo of course and you can see the indicator functioning right now this is the rear fog light and uh actually like the car's design from the rear okay let's see the tire right away there it is the tire and this is the exhaust the rear exhaust of course you've got two of them on this car in this car whatever let's open this power tailgate as well boot carrying capacity is actually decent enough and below here you get the spare wheel which is obviously not an alloy it's a smaller sized wheel which will not dwell into because it's just a one one five ninety five seventeen we're tire sizes to be honest let's shut this okay there is the manual placement there as a well charging socket as well this opens there's a light placement here first aid kit and you can split out the seat but you know there's a gap here i don't know why there's a gap it's kind of weird and awkward and let's press this button to close the boot okay the warning triangle is right there there it shuts now they have this chrome line which is continuing throughout the car you can see this okay unfortunately though it's not so fluid in certain areas there's sort of a panel gap i don't know how that happens oh well this is called british engineering excellence at its very best okay i am mocking and i'm taunting but yeah that's a fact everyone keeps blaming indian cars for bad uh you know fit finish of the panels well the british's britishers are no less car is unfortunately locked so that's about it that is a walk around of this car let's start driving right away just kidding okay i have to unlock the car from here and also turn off the indicator which is making some noise all right you can see the dashboard design is actually quite nice and this is actually a practical mini because of the long wheelbase there's good amount of space on offer there's good amount of storage space as well look at the storage bed that's amazing okay quality is nice it gets proper leather as well which the lower model does not get in fact the jcw inspired model gets a lot of features like a bigger screen for the infotainment system and a lot of bits which should actually be standard in the non-jcw model as well you get isofix anchors and then you can recline the seat like this and then it is upright why would it be so upright i have no freaking idea take some effort to push it back into place and there it is completely into place now this can be moved ahead or behind but yeah after some effort it has gone behind and of course now you can see the legroom has improved dramatically that is the reason there was this gap in the boot now this is actually the lever to operate this can't operate with one hand at all inside there there's good amount of legroom and nerman offer scooped out seat back magazine holder where there's something i don't know anyways two usbc charging sockets ac vents here as well none here no height adjustable seat belts and you get a hook along with a handle as well let's shut the door at the moment okay glass area is decent enough because there's a glass area here as well bringing in a lot of light and seat belt for the center passenger is here on the top and the center passenger obviously gets a head because it's a proper adjustable headrest and of course there is a center armrest with twin cup holders too meanwhile there is a sun blind here for the sunroof this one does not open there's light placement here as well in the center now this obviously does not open but they could have given a larger one piece unit but for this light they actually compromise on that it's kind of surprising under the support though is a bit of an issue and headroom is just about adequate as well so rear seat experience is actually quite nice i like it but there could have been some storage here in the center but they've given massive storage on the door pocket so that's not something you would really complain about love the treatment on the seat seats are really very nice dashboard looks fantastic thankfully with the latest generation of the countrymen they've got rid of plastics but still quite a few of them here and there now this jcw inspired model obviously gets more kit including a harman kardon audio system and uh a lot of other things which should be standard like i've been always mentioning minis have not been well equipped just because of the styling factor now you get electric adjust for both the front seats however the driver also gets memory function you can save up to google settings the best thing is under the support is not an issue because you can just press this and open the i mean extend the seat base to improve under the support this is to open the boot of the vehicle there's good amount of storage space at the front chrome controls for the power windows and this is to lock i mean this is to retract or unretract i don't know if that is a word the outside review mirrors nice because nice chrome treatments lot of clone treatment but hard plastics are there and soft ones are there too now it gets these uh pedals which are very nice along with a dead pedal as well since john cooper works right there again a specific feature of the john cooper works inspired model these are the controls for the headlights of course and you get a headlight leveler this is for front fork this for rear fog let's step inside but look at the seats just so damn awesome really very comfy and below the front center armrest there's actually a wireless charging pad which is not very easy to use to be honest and here you can see there is some amount of storage space along with a usb charging socket now this is a usb c charging socket electric parking brake control controls for the i drive system and call the eye drive only thing is in bmw when you turn like this it goes down how you have to do it ulta i don't know my tool okay the glove box is decent size not really very big but hard plastic slow down that's the ambient lighting the light actually is fantastic in this car because this ring changes according to what you're doing so when you're reversing and you're about to hit an obstacle it turns red when you turn on the air conditioning and when you turn this you can see the color is changing when you're operating the air conditioning that's also pretty awesome depending on where you're taking the temperature so yeah this is a nice unit this is eight point eight inch meanwhile the lower trim actually gets six point five inch or so switch into into there's a reverse parking camera which is on at the moment which gets adaptive guidelines as well and rear parking sensors can be seen here it's a touch operated unit obviously very nice very fluid to use and see the quality of the screen it's so good now that even in bright sunlight you can see everything love the way mini does the controls which are sort of aircraft style there is a secret lighter here a proper usb charging socket right there this is for the stop start system this is to turn on the vehicle traction control and this is for the drive mode this is for air conditioning air conditioning controls are given right there air conditioning actually works flawlessly well auto dimming inside rear view mirror again the toggle switches for the lights very much like an aircraft and this is to open the sunroof so now here's the problem the sunroof is opening but the sun line has to be manually retracted only yeah you have to manually retract the sunlight but i said once again it opens further hello everybody how are you why am i shouting like stupid anyways let's shut this and let's shut that as well so both should have been operated simultaneously and why it operates like this now there of course is a mirror along with two lights on this side same as the case here as well a mirror along with two lights and there is the mic structured properly so overall dashboard design is obviously very attractive you get a heads-up display as well which shows you a lot of data in fact uh you know if you are having a bluetooth okay there you can see audio information also comes on the heads-up display along with navigation data as well so this is to lock the car this is unlock the car some of these controls a lot of chrome used inside steering feels nice to hold gets the jcw batching so this is the jcw steering wheel plastic paddle shifters these are actually the controls for the multi-information display this for voice command is to pick up a phone and this is for cruise control i love the red stitching i love how they've made the steering feels really very nice fantastic attention to detail looks fantabulous without a doubt let's get into reverse i've already shown you the reverse parking camera but hey we can do that again any which ways now to browse through this system it's very easy because it's very fluid and very nice i mean it's very funky as well so this navigation which is inbuilt so you can see that as well let's just get to the map so you can see how amazing the display is on this car that is so phenomenal totally love it it's also telling me that i have my managed 8.4 kilometers per liter that's kind of bad that's not something which you should be showing me and making me regret why i opted for a petrol one over a diesel meanwhile these are actually the controls for the indicators this bc button is to browse through the lower screen so it's showing me a lot of information there as well fuel efficiency real-time mileage whatever whatever okay indicator shut yourself now this is a 5.5 inch screen it's a digital one this is for the fuel meter and this is for the tachometer here you get the speedometer and lot of information on the top like what is the distance to empty what's the temperature like time clock blah blah blah and when you actually turn this on it shows you the mini logo when you turn it off it again shows you the mini logo it always keeps reminding you that you're in a mini why this thing does not do a good enough job of what obviously you get the chrome surround as well now let me do one thing let me turn off the car so when you turn off the car there the heads-up display actually goes back inside and when you turn it on obviously the heads-up display comes out let it shut itself there it is and now we turn on the car and there it come on it's so freaking slow but it's there whenever you need it and then you can see the information i don't think you can okay saying mini right there yeah there it is now let's use the wipers right away good amount of spray on offer yeah it's actually a lot of spray on offer change the windscreen in no time at all and also cleans the sunroof as well let's use the rear wipers and there you see the spray is also nice here again very nice wipers on this guy i really like the vipers on this car very fast very smooth only thing is the washer fluid is so much a completely cleans the whole car now you can see these lights keep changing as per its own mode as such which is pretty nice harman kardon speakers are fantabulous let's listen to an audio right away [Music] audio quality is very very very nice very impressive audio quality what do you think about the dashboard design i think it looks pretty dumb awesome air conditioning works nice good amount of features as well although it could have got a lot more features like ventilations because i'm boiling at the moment i'm literally boiling with so much sweat coming out because it's like what two o'clock and we are right in the middle with the sun shining brightly let's do one thing let's start driving right away first things first air conditioning off we get into sport mode we also get into sport mode for the overall settings of the car we turn on sport displays traction control off press it once it is dynamic traction control keep it pressed it turns off completely that dsc deactivated close this message we have the sports displays on left foot on the brake right foot on the actuator driving the motor doesn't really live [Music] but then it gives you quite a bit of wheel spin and off we go so performance is actually very very very nice indeed this is a two liter turbo petrol engine known as the twin power turbo petrol whatever you want to call it it actually powers a lot of bmw cars and it is fantastic in the way it produces its mid-range performance because lower down it feels a little laggy although there's no turbo lag as such but it doesn't have that grunt lower down but the mid range is very surprising around 1800 900 rpm it pushes forward with a lot of enthusiasm and pulls very strongly indeed this gearbox is a seven speed dual clutch gearbox which is very eager and very fast with shifts only thing is sometimes it doesn't give you the downshift which you're looking for now this engine produces 192 horsepower and 280 newton meters of torque the result is 0 200 kilometers per hour in a claim 7.5 seconds which is actually 0.8 seconds slower than the regular mini cooper s with the same engine but it's lighter of course three-door this is weighing around 1500 kgs but doesn't feel its weight at all that is the level of agility on offer this engine super duper refined but becomes very sporty once you push it yeah that sporty sound is not courtesy of the exhaust unfortunately there's some fake sound which comes in the cabin why are the speakers yeah that is a bit of a problem however most people don't even recognize it because it's so well calibrated this thickness as well pulls really nice and strong and there are four drive modes on offer sorry there's three drive modes which alter four parameters of the car so there is green which is obviously for eco mode there is mid which is for normal mode and this sport which is for sport mode now the four parameters which are being altered is the engine the transmission as well as the steering and the sound of this car okay there's a b class which is going to fly by so the sound also gets altered there are two settings for the sound actually normal and sport same way the two settings for the steering wheel which is normal and sport however for the engine there are three settings even for the transmission which is normal eco and sport so in sport all the four things are in sport in eco two things are in eco which is obviously the engine in the transmission and two things are in normal which is the steering as well as the sound and in normal everything is in normal like all the four parameters are in normal indeed i love the way this car is so pinpoint accurate handling is super duper awesome okay we're going to get into manual we are in manual mode it will hold on to again it will not up shift unless and until i decide to do so there holding the red line close to 7000 rpm crossing 100 kilometers per hour in third gear itself this is such an engaging and fun car to drive it's absolutely stunning the steering wheel is so pinpoint accurate you can feel exactly where the front wheels are pointing that is the level of precision from the steering wheel body roll what is that there is no body roll here it has amazing body control the suspension is really very stiff that's why ride quality is very bad in fact it's atrocious to say the least even on like normal roads like this you can feel the car moving around there is no flex in the chassis but the suspension is like okay it's just not comfortable enough for long journeys even for passengers in the car they are not really comfortable in this vehicle because this car is not about comfort or practicality although the countryman dredged towards practicality by offering a decent sized boot and space at the rear but hey there is no body roll so people would not feel that but people sitting inside the car will definitely feel the stiff suspension and that's the reason i would say if you're buying a countryman for practicality please don't if you're buying a countryman for performance and fun please don't get the mini cooper the regular one the three door even the fighter for that matter but then again in the fight or why would you see more people in the car they're going to feel pukish for sure because of the stiff suspension the ride is really bad at low speeds it kind of gets better as you like speed up so it comes into its own element here we're going to change this the mode so that you can see the different colors as well and this is the green green is basically efficiency made is like normal performance but in sport mode is where it really gives you all those i mean all the punch it has and it feels really exciting to drive in sport mode because the performance is really amazing it's like fantabulous in fact top speed is i think around 230 kilometers per hour but you wouldn't really care to go that fast in this car because you hit one bump and then kind of gets unsettled because of the stiffness and i'm talking about uncertainty because of the expansion joint on the expansion like oh my goodness the suspension also can get quite noisy especially on this jcw inspired version the problem is okay hear this yeah the problem is that they've gone one big on the wheel which means the profile has also decreased and you can see the result for yourself right comfort not it's 40 at all and this jcw inspired has a sportier version of the already sporty dual clutch gearbox still it's not really fast with downshifts or eagle with downshifts as such and braking performance is actually quite nice it stops in its track but i i feel that it requires even stronger brakes considering the mad performance on offer from this mini cooper s countryman john cooper works inspired to lead a turbo petrol engine car ah stopped okay listen to this okay [Music] yeah there are modes for the gearbox as well and what are the modes for the gearbox well either you can be in drive or you can mean sport or you can be in manual and once you touch any of the paddles you trigger the manual mode and the best thing is it will hold on to again it will not up shift until and unless you decide to do something talking about expansion joint i was telling you about it and you can feel it right now as well handling is just amazing okay just amazing the steering is so pinpoint accurate it is actually on the heavier side at lower speeds but it is so freaking feelsome offers the right feedback offers the right weight and just i mean it glides through corners you can feel exactly where the front wheels are pointing there since there's no body roll either it just feels amazing to drive nothing even comes close to this car other than other mini cooper motors of course there's no flex in the chassis just just such an engaging and fun car to drive which reminds me there was also a diesel on offer earlier before the pre-face lift i mean in the pre-facelift the problem is that they have discontinued diesel completely on many models but the pressleys or rather the brochure or whatever information about this car they sent me it had diesel mentioned and it had an sd mention in it i don't know where that diesel is it's vanished but a diesel obviously doesn't offer the same level of thrill as a petrol engine but has that torque which it can this one kind of lacks lower down the reverse that's why drivability is not its forte at all it it kind of feels lacking lower down in the rev range and only to greet you with a stupendous mid-range and of course it's a drinker okay it returns somewhere between seven to ten kilometers per liter depending on your driving side obviously you can stretch that a bit by driving safely but if you want to drive same way just get a bmw x1 it uses the same uk l2 platform and this guy competes with the volvo xc40 as well as the bmw x1 and the mercedes gla and the audi q2 a lot of rivals but by far this is the best in terms of driving ability now this is obviously a front wheel drive car that's the reason why it spins its wheels like crazy but still no tendency to understeer boss it is not having any understeer although minion also offers all grip abroad that's only going to add to weight and slow down the car but you know rear wheel drive is for the win but no mini model comes with your b drive either you get front wheel drive or all four this is so much like audi has it light off listen to this it does have a tendency to make a lot of wheel spin sounds yeah depending on how you launch it it can make even more sounds but nothing close to the bmw x1 because the diesel engine obviously has a lot more torque as well so that two variants on offer there is the cooper s and there's the cooper s john cooper works inspired which is this one which is priced at rupees 52.5 lakhs four lakhs cheaper is for the lower variant or the entry-level variant or whatever you want to call it now the thing is all the prices i mentioned obviously on mumbai what you get is stupendous amount of equipment for a mini in the john cooper works inspired model along with less practicality because of the bigger wheels of course and overall a very fun car to drive but then i just don't understand why would i buy the countryman because it is not really practical even though it's practical when i can get the same levels of fun by being lesser with the meaning cooper regular model the cooper s three door or the five door or john cooper works or any of those cars maybe even the convertible for that matter of course this is a different flavor of suv or crossover from mini [Music] now another very cool feature of this car is when you're driving in eco mode which i'm going to put the car in right now which is the green mode of course and now you just notice one thing the way the rpm meter is just observe the rpm meter how it keeps declining putting the car in the highest gear possible and then at one point what it does is it kind of gets into neutral it disengages with the gearbox and decouples with it and there you see 1000 rpm that's how it tries to conserve fuel as much as possible and then you get on the throttle and of course it will pick up pace really fast but not as fast as when we are in sport mode because sport mode feels the most fun to drive for sure maybe adaptive dampers could have been offered to make the ride more comfortable so usually you say you know they should offer adaptive dampers so that the handling becomes even better in sport but no no no handling is perfect so no chain needed there what we need is little bit less stiff dampers at lower speeds or especially in comfort mode or in eco mode so you know it's like ulta which i might expecting i want less 40 suspension option as well so guys this is my vlog of the meaning cooper countryman i think it's fantastic it's really fun to drive it's a different take on doing an suv or a crossover or whatever you want to call it and mini has that jump but it is quite expensive as well and of course i miss diesel because yeah i have to fill up fuel right away bye [Music] you
8;Mini;2022 Mini Countryman;2022 MINI Cooper S Countryman Review | Behind the Wheel;the last term you ever want to use when you're talking about a mini is large but yet you can't help but use that term when you're talking about a countryman because well it is the largest of the model lineup it's a five-door crossover that is about a mere inch more than 14 feet long about six feet wide and just over five feet tall to be honest with you next to our family car which is montero this thing looks like a little type it's actually quite cute unfortunately the term large also is used to describe its price kind of painful so the question is does this 2022 mini countryman s actually deserve the price it commands let's find out [Music] [Music] do you need help purchasing your car insurance head on

best deal on insurance without a deal i'm not sponsored or anything by carmen's best i only thought about this skit right now because it's quite warm today but much like the ice cream i haven't met a mini cooper that i did not absolutely fall in love with and this this blue has got me floored now i did mention that it is a bit on the pricey side and that's true but it's really not the fault of the car not at all see in the united states if you were to get this trim you're going to spend roughly about 38 39 000 so you're looking at about 2 million philippine pesos but because of all the tariffs that you need to pay when the car gets here and of course they import taxes say hello to three million seven hundred and fifty thousand fifteen pesos but back to the original question is it worth it at its heart is a twin power turbo two liter four-cylinder gasoline engine mounted to a seven-speed dct that produces 192 horses and 280 newton meters of torque now what all that mumbo jumbo means is that inside the city moderate traffic will return about 12 kilometers per liter but on the highway this thing is capable of 20 kilometers per liter those figures are roughly the same as a subcompact sedan that has only a 1.5 liter engine granted this is also four times the price but think of it this way this can achieve zero to 100 kilometers per hour in just seven and a half seconds it's got a top speed of 226 kilometers per hour and there is no way a subcompact sedan sounds like this the 2022 revision introduced a lot of new changes and it essentially made its predecessor look well kind of old in a day paired with its iron blue color not only is it stunning but it's still distinctly mini in design there's hardly any chrome on here with the painted surfaces instead of old shiny bits that we're kind of used to in the previous iteration it's an all led affair with projectors and fog lamps found down below that have such an awesome throw and then this brilliant drl that surrounds the entire headlamp it's so cool it looks like it looks like david bowie with eyeliner maybe not as cool and the only thing though is that i wish that they would have hit the sensors just a little bit better i don't mind them they're not bothersome but yeah a little bit more work on that would have been nice so you got matching accents down the side roof rails and cladding at the bottom a black roof with matching mirrors that have repeaters and then 165 millimeters of ground clearance not much for a crossover no but the 165 is helped by these large doors and smaller windows to give the appearance of a larger automobile then these are some of the biggest wheels i've also seen on the mini they're two-tone 19s on 45 series tires which to be honest with you add such a badass factor to this car and then these guys are in front of discs up front and discs at the rear some of the most robust brakes that i've ever used in my entire life i mean they're so strong it feels like they could stop the rotation of the earth as if its size and shape weren't iconic enough now you can really spot a mini from like miles away thanks to these bright rear leds and the union jack pattern that you will find inside these guys are so bright that if you're stuck in traffic and you're applying the brakes look at your rear view mirror and you'll be like oh momolo it happened uh also since this is an s there are twin exhausts found down below now when you open it up with the power tailgate which is actually pretty fast by the way jack noticed that you are looking at 450 liters of very usable space because this to know can actually 86. um at 450 liters of space you're looking at about the category of the same subcompact sedans that i was talking to about talking about earlier uh and if you haven't seen that review by the way i just shameless plug do click somewhere on the link because we have a comparable of the m grand the city and also the almera which actually was a lot of fun to do if it's the link's not on the screen i'm sure it's somewhere down below now back to the mini it may have a little bit less space than the subcompact sedans because those guys were above 450 a little over 500 but when you fold the second row you are looking at a thousand four hundred liters of space now there's no way a subcompact end has that and then also obviously there's a little bit more space when you remove the false bottom and then there's also this cool and nifty feature that you can stick out so you can hang out at the back of your mini without scratching your car or dirtying your legs that is pretty darn cool i like that i wish all cars had that the rear seats of the countryman s are a pretty large contrast from those uh front because well the bolsterings back here aren't as noticeable or as supportive as that in the front seats and quite in fact if you were to go around the twisties you'd actually be kind of sliding around back here which might be actually a lot of fun uh toys back here include air vents found up front two of them i might add and then two type c charging points then in the center armrest you've got two cup holders and then additionally you've got bottle holders on either door with speakers space is actually pretty decent elbow room for two passengers in the rear not an issue a third passenger not so great because well there's a tunnel and yeah that's gonna eat up a lot of elbow room so two adults actually not an issue uh legroom is actually pretty good because you can stretch your legs even underneath the passenger or rather the driver's seat because that's well that's my normal driving position so uh leg room is you're looking at maybe about seven or eight inches that's actually pretty big and then head room at least four inches man that's a lot of space back there um it's quite comfortable and the air is actually pretty good back here as well i have sat back here while jack drove and the other time my wife drove and i got to tell you the air is actually pretty good too because well since the cabin is not very big and there's a to no for the cargo space it cools the cabin off very very quickly and that i think is actually a pretty big plus now if you've never sat inside a mini before and partly because you've always thought that that car is basically for coco sized people that's where you're dead wrong check this out see the mini and its power chairs can adjust so much so that i don't think fitting quite much taller people would ever be an issue inside this car because not only can you move the chair this far back but you can also make it sink and then move the steering wheel as close to the dashboard as possible look at the amount of space i have i'm telling you right now from my foot to the accelerator it's roughly about seven inches that's seven inches of leg room and look at the headroom look at that that's now what is that is that another eight inches that's eight inches dude and look at the reach that i have to the steering wheel oh mind you that when you do move the steering wheel even if you are a taller passenger the instrument cluster actually moves up and down with you i am not the biggest fan of it simply because i just like the analog gauges more but that's actually pretty darn cool so truly i'm not saying that shaquille o'neal could fit back here no not that but anyone above six feet tall possibly even six two six three even six four wouldn't have an issue sitting or driving inside this car and then watching them getting in and out of it would actually pretty damn damn funny too on the well-appointed steering wheel you will have buttons for your audio and cruise function with a braking function it's not a full-on adaptive feature but it'll be enough to keep you from rear-ending someone in front although wheel mounted paddles are available to keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes focused on the roads thanks to a heads-up display which provides speed and select menu displays you've got an 8.8 inch touchscreen infotainment system which doubles as your reverse camera which can be controlled either via the touchscreen or the idrive system using the knob here at the bottom if you know the idrive system that means it's basically a bmw which means it's actually pretty darn snappy the good news is is that it has apple carplay and wireless apple carplay at that the bad news is no android automatic air knobs found just above a few function buttons and then just below that toggle switches that this century's minis have been known for which include an eco standard and sport driving mode and then some found on the roof one of which changes the ambient light inside the car which it's no disco but damn that looks pretty darn good the speakers inside the automobile are harman kardon and they sound pretty great the base at the start needs a little bit of help but you can easily change that in the settings of the automobile which brings me to the three things that i'd wanna tweak inside this car or perhaps even change number one is that well there's no android capability not everybody's apple so please include that number two these buttons here i thought they were touchscreen apparently not they're actually buttons that you have to press actually quite hard and number three it's very cool that there is a charging pad found here on the center armrest which has a clip unfortunately it can only hold quite small phones like it'll fit jacks but mine is just too big what what do you mean what did i say something wrong the countryman is well equipped with a total of six airbags abs with ebd parking sensors stability control traction control or reverse camera tire pressure monitoring and isofix [Music] ride height or not there is little so almost no body roll inside this car even when you're taking corners which makes the mini just so fun to drive lane changes are immediate the steering is so quick that you're in a turn even before you're actually there it's mind-boggling now for those that know what to expect from a mini that's actually a great thing for those that don't well it's not as if that you're going to be questioning your life choices when you're driving on edza because of the rigidity of the chassis no not a month understand that it's not rules but the trade-off is is that it's got a very go-kart feel to it and on paved roads wow this thing is just so planted oh and speaking of rolls-royce i actually had the opportunity of meeting the ceo when he was visiting manila a couple of years back torston mueller otvos god i hope i'm saying his name right the thing about him is is that when he's not balling in rolls guess what car he's driving i'll give you three guesses but you're only gonna need one the nvh inside this automobile is actually quite superb you'd expect that when you're on the highway it's almost dead quiet really but inside the city it's actually pretty darn good the most unpaved roads that we can think of would be like again edsa but even then it's actually pretty darn quiet and it starts when you close the door really because the car just feels like it's built solid it's so quiet and yet check this out when we open the door you can hear the road and the cars passing by once you close it it's solid and all of a sudden it's just so quiet it's amazing granted the tire noise inside the city on more unbehaved paved roads does creep in yes but i mean you're rolling around on 19 and 45 so it is a bit expected the dct is well it's kind of uncharacteristic of a dct granted because the dct's that we're normally used to is on much more affordable vehicles where uh it's trying to get rid of first and second gear as quickly as possible and there's a bit of a jolt here there is none i mean you can floor it on on on eco on sport or on normal mode and the transitions are actually pretty smooth and i like it i think the best part about this automobile is i like the fact that it's so tiny and powerful at the same time that it can bring you to the speeds of going back to november 12 1955 in less than 10 seconds and at the same time it's got breaks that can hold you in 2019 forever it's kind of a deep reference but you'll get it [Music] minnie has been getting a lot of flack and loyalists are right to say that it's not the same car anymore it's it's either too big it's too expensive it's too german and yeah i get all of that but the truth is for a nameplate to survive it's gotta evolve no matter what anybody says but at what cost okay so truth is you can probably get yourself a bmw x1 for much less than you would spend on this countryman well this is essentially the same as a bmw because it's a bmw underneath but i guarantee you that the x1 won't make you smile from ear to ear or as much as this countryman will so is it worth it maybe not to you and me but i'll tell you one thing that the next time i see this on the road i'm gonna be extremely jealous of the person driving that's a fact [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
9;Mini;2022 Mini Countryman;Heres why the 2022 MINI Countryman JCW is Frankly Awesome!;g'day guys matt brandt here let me ask you a question let's say you go out you well you want to go out you want to buy yourself a mini but you don't want a mini you know you don't want a small car but you want a mini you know but you don't want a mini but you want a mini what do you do what does one do in that situation well that's a great question and that's what i'm here to answer you go out and you buy yourself one of these it's a mini countryman but this isn't just any mini countryman this is the mini countryman jcw john cooper works which means that yes under the bonnet is a fire breathing four-cylinder it's got a lot of power as we'll get into and you get an all-wheel drive car that's essentially a family hauler today we're going to be doing a full in-depth review of the new mini countryman i'm going to show you the exterior the interior i'm going to launch this thing from zero to 100 kilometers an hour to see if it's really as quick as the manufacturer's claim and of course we're going to give it some source around saucy corner because that's what we do here at matt brown cars and you know what you do you subscribe so go down there hit the subscribe button hit that notification bell you know what to do all right let's just uh let's get into the review baby don't know what i say sometimes okay let's start with the front of the mini countryman with what's new so first of all you get a revised bumper up front and the led headlights have been updated they are led now standard across the range and this one here is matrix led so it blanks out part of its beams for oncoming traffic because this is the top spec mini yours there are some things that i especially love about the front of the mini countryman i love the blacked out badging you have to look the john cooper works badge up front get this nice chilly red stripe here and they extend across the rest of the car i don't know how i feel about uh the amount of chilli red it's a bit too spicy for my liking get it i really need to reconsider my life choices but yeah i mean it's a pretty good looking car from the front especially for an suv and like any good v8 monster you get a a a bonnet hood thing except this is not a this is not a v8 this is a four cylinder it's alright bmw mini are still learning for those who don't know it's made by bmw all right let's check out the sign what the whole the mini countryman doesn't actually look that big right but once you actually see it from the side that's when you start to notice that maybe this is an suv not a bad thing because for an suv it is still quite small on the outside but on the inside as you'll see it's pretty massive so what do you get out here where you get these 19-inch alloy wheels they are wrapped in eagle f1 rubber which is really good and look you get massive brakes up front john cooper works branded though i think they're brembos could be wrong but of course you get the quintessential black plastic cladding and more chilly red chili red here here here and on the roof look how massive that chilly red paint is on the the roof i don't like it i would get it in black but yeah look you get keyless entry and and go although the keys are inside we can cut that out oh look you get suv rails up top on this top spec mini yours you also get a double panoramic sunroof up top and we'll come over here and um yeah i really don't know what else to say about this there's not that much going on it's pretty cool let's take a look at the back and then there is the rear and biggest change you're gonna notice are the union jack tail lights these are like a more 3d effect than you'll find on other minis and i love them they look especially cool at night you've got your classic little roof spoiler here for maximum aerodynamics and then you get more blacked out badging look mini's blacked out the countryman badge is blacked out though it is a really cool look at bold and spaced out then of course you get fake diffuser down here but this is my favorite part these exhausts they sound amazing take a listen oh and how could i forget the john cooper works badge back there yay what about boot space i've had to over expose myself so you can see inside of here but look you press that it is an automatic tailgate it opens up nice and automatically and you get a decent amount of storage in here it's not class leading but it's still pretty good look you get a little false floor and you get even more storage under there that's actually really good you've got a little storage area here you got your your load cover there it's like a cardboard i've never felt that before and of course you can get more space if you you come around here and if you do that and yeah you find a button of some sort ah here it is it's a pulley it comes down like that you could you could do the same for the other side oh and then we we have one left up oh you get the picture that goes down somehow and yep something so actually storage space within here is surprisingly good it's much better than in a standard mini which is why you'd go for something like this over something like that have you ever thought to yourself huh what does the interior of an 83 000 car look like well let's go let's go check that out okay let's talk about the interior now because all jokes aside this is a really nice place to be a couple of weeks ago now i was in the mini jcw three door which is only a few thousand dollars less than this but this comes with so much more in terms of its engine and drivetrain and then interior space which is probably more important that's definitely more of like a bachelor's car this is definitely more of a well a practical car the first thing that's always struck me with the interior of minis and bmw really is just the quality it's all really solid in here you got some you know strange interesting patterns on here but they're not bad and even the harder plastics like here they're still soft i love this too you get alcantara here on the doors it's a really cool touch i love alcantara then you've got the classic mini design touches like these toggle switches here they just feel so nice to click they're also up here as well where you can also control your sunroof but we'll put that back down because it's freezing today the other thing i love about mini interiors and this is the same of course is that you get these like interactive interior led lights so when you change the temperature control it shows up here when you change into different sport modes it changes the interior lighting or you can use this toggle up here to get the same effect it's just really cool speaking of air conditioning controls they're really easy to use they work i like them too this steering wheel it's a really nice steering wheel it's out of the bmw parts bin but that's not a bad thing because it's honestly one of my favorites it's super thick and chunky snap leather so it's nice to hold on to the john cooper works badge down the bottom and it's just really functional and you can also control your adaptive cruise control which was new for the facelift so that's cool the one thing i'm not so sure about is the digital instrument cluster the more i use it the less i like it it's just really basic and competitors especially at this price point like the audi q3 they just do it way better it's functional enough but um the only real thing you can adjust on it is a tiny sliver of display right down the bottom but it's cool party trick is that because it's mounted on the steering wheel column when you move the steering wheel up and down it moves with it so that's pretty cool kind of same with the heads-up display it was the same issue that i had in the mini three door in that i can't really see it at a lot of positions because the steering wheel would just block it maybe maybe next time bmw just projected onto the windscreen like you do in your other cars i think it's a better solution one thing that's stolen straight from bmw and i'm not mad about it is the infotainment display now it's small 8.8 inches in today's day is actually quite small you know hyundai's are coming with 10.25 inch displays are standard and they're really good this is still very good it's high definition really easy to use i prefer using the idrive controller down here though again it's just like small things it's just a bit too far back so i'm finding i'm having to have my arm like that which is not comfortable but it's still a very good system easy to use super high definition and very responsive too it's pretty functional yet navigation digital radio wireless apple carplay but no android auto but otherwise it's decent speaking of wireless you get a wireless charger here and i've got a i've got a ginormous iphone 13 pro max thing and and that doesn't fit but of all the mini wireless chargers i've tried this is the widest so if you don't have a huge chunk of a phone you'll probably be able to use it unlike in the mini three door although you do get a usb a port up front a 12 volt socket and under here you get a little usbc port so plenty of ways to charge your devices if they're too fat to fit in there the cool thing about this armrest is that it ratchets and you've got a storage area under there you've got a storage area up front and a couple of cup holders here oh i should mention you get pretty massive door bins and glove box it's a pretty decent size what else oh the seats how can i forget the seats these are the mini your seats and unlike again the mini three door they're electric it's amazing the 83 grand who could have expected electric adjusting seats but they are really really good super super comfy and they're quite well bolstered too they're heated too that's lovely look you get little touches like the union jack on the side and of course the headrest is a massive union jack the germans really don't want you to forget that you're in a british car nah it's called design touches oh and you get a harman kardon sound system sounds really good i'm trying to think about what i i really don't like in here and honestly it's just nitpicking it's a really nice place to be but even better i think is the back seats because it's super usable let's go check that out okay so the rear so on 5 foot 11 i have so much toe room so much leg room and so much head room it is super spacious back here surprisingly so because the outside really isn't that big the inside because this is a giant square you do have so much room get little pockets back here you get your little air vents no third zone climate control but it's good enough you get two usbc fast charge ports there the back seats get their own sunroof again it's just a really nice touch these seats these mini yours leather seats back here they're just as nice as up front i really like them you don't get an arm rest which is a bit of a shame although you can just oh my god you can just do that and have a pseudo arm rest but that's effort oh and a couple of party tricks look you can slide these leads back and forth like a real suv or if you find the pull tab thing you can you can you can recline so yeah that's pretty good and really this is the biggest reason why you would buy this over a standard mini because the mini is uh really mini and this mini is a proper suv you have actual loads of room back here no compromises up front you don't have to slide the seat forward to fit back here this is a true family car yet it's still small and nimble enough to to be a city car so i i really appreciate that let's talk about some specs before we talk about specs check this out i love the way that this opens up and it leaves the headlights there i don't know why it's just really cool so the whole range starts with the cooper that starts at just over 50 000 australian that will get you a 100 kilowatt three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine it doesn't sound like a lot i mean it's not but it's a pretty sprightly engine i actually really like it however what you really want is this just behemoth of a of a hot suv because that will get you the bmw b48 four cylinder it is a turbocharged unit of course and it pumps out 225 kilowatt of power 450 newton meters of torque and as you'll find out on the drive yeah this thing is quick the whole range starts with the pure and that's 70 000 australian dollars and this jcw mini yours that will set you back around 83 000 australian dollars that is a lot of money but it does compete with cars like the bmw x2 m35i which i reviewed and you can click up somewhere there to watch that and as you'll see this isn't any ordinary car this is a true performance car and what better way to show you that than by doing some launch control okay so mini claim that this countryman jcw does at 100 kilometers an hour in just 5.1 seconds but let's see what it will actually do so we'll put the transmission into s put the car into sport mode we'll turn off the traction 1 so it puts on dynamic traction control and then all we need to do is break and floor the accelerator so let's do that [Music] oh man oh this thing is so fast so 0-100 in 5.4 seconds that's not the best but to be fair as i said it's a wet day still the all-wheel drive system here did a really good job at hooking up and we'll come back to driving in a moment i promise but yeah this thing is this thing is pretty quick for a for a family suv all right i think it's about time we take this thing on the road okay so here we are on the roads and of course it's horrific weather but that's not actually a bad thing because well this is an all-wheel drive and so what better way to test out the grip of an all-wheel drive suv than by by flooring it in the rain so yes this has mini's all four system as they brand it which really just means it's a front-wheel drive biased all-wheel drive system so it will send power to the rear wheels when it thinks it needs to but most of the time it's just front-wheel drive so before we get to the twisties let's talk about how it performs on the highway and frankly really really well i was really expecting a car with extremely extremely stiff suspension but you don't get that right now i'm in mid mode which is like their way of saying normal and so the adaptive dampers are at their slackers and so at these high speeds i'm super impressed because it's not crashy it's not like jumping you around it's really reasonable we can also put the car into green ooh that's like eco mode and it kind of just dulls everything down but what we really want is sport mode you can hear that the exhaust opens up the steering becomes quite heavy and it's really good because it's only one and a half turns locked to lock so it feels a lot more nimble than it probably should and of course our throttle response becomes much better and that becomes equally better when we put the transmission into sport mode so let's do that one thing i've noticed with a lot of minis is that you do get quite a bit of road noise and wind noise and i presume that comes down to the fact that they're essentially rolling squares it also doesn't help that these are on run flat tires and so they just create quite a bit more noise when you add it with the 19-inch alloy wheels you know it's not the it's not the greatest recipe for comfort and and and quietness but it does pretty well alrighty let's give this thing some sauce [Music] oh yeah so power is sent through an eight-speed torque converter transmission and it's it's a really good transmission up shifts are really smooth and seamless as are downshifts but we're in the twisty so we've got to give this thing some twisty source and what i won't be doing is turning off the uh traction control on a day like this uh i think you can all understand this is one of the things i actually like more about this car than the three-door mini is that this is an all-wheel drive and that means that it does have so much more grip than a front-wheel drive car in this kind of weather a front-wheel drive or even a rear-wheel drive car they become useless i'm actually going to do a little test here so as i said this is front-wheel drive bias it's really wet outside right now let's see how long it takes for it to send power to the rear okay so let's do it that was pretty instantaneous as i said the weather conditions right now are horrific so for it to be able to hook up like that i'm really impressed this is the ultimate test though ladies and gents saucy corner let's give it some sauce took a while to move there oh there we go okay so a bit of understeer but it hooks up really well it's not scrambling for traction it's doing a really good job that exhaust sound is so good too now some of that is pumped in of course but it's not too obtrusive and the exhaust genuinely does have a few crackles and pop to it some things that this actually has over a standard countryman is it's got a stiffer body you've got bracing up in the engine bay and it just uses a bit more adhesives and you can tell because when you chuck this thing around the corner as i said even on a wet day like today it still does very well okay so we're in a bit of a residential area here let's put the transmission into normal and the car into mid or normal and it really does just become an entirely different beast this is where it really feels like any car on the road sometimes you really do forget that this car has as much power as it does until of course you put your foot down and it pulls hard the other thing that really impressed me was braking because the brakes on these things are tremendous for example if i do a full emergency stop god yeah it's really really good it just stops really quickly the brakes up front especially are absolutely enormous so it's really got the whole package it's got everything i'm kind of shocked i didn't expect much from this i'll be honest with you but it surprised me this thing is surprisingly good i've gotta give it source one more time one more time oh yes so what's my final verdict on the mini cooper countryman jcw all for something in all seriousness i think that this thing is is really cool even though it's an suv i would probably buy it over the three-door because the three-door comes with way less power it's front-wheel drive this is all-wheel drive it is a true sports car in every sense of the word this thing is fully kitted out and yes it's feeling a little bit old in a tooth maybe in some areas but mini have done a really good job at keeping everything updated i wouldn't go for the the mini yours you don't need to spend 83 grand on this car i think the pure at 70 grand is is a much better buy and you get essentially all you would ever really need anyway but i'm curious what do you guys think of the mini cooper countryman jcw or4 i don't even know would you buy one let me know in the comment section below just below that like button subscribe if you're new to the channel i'd love to have you around and as always i'll see you next week
10;Mini;2022 Mini Countryman;"2022 Mini Cooper Countryman Review: Not So ""Mini""";let's floor it off the land look at this kind of slow i can't even beat this lexus es and there's an old wow i can't make it up probably an 80 year old lady driving that and i couldn't beat her off the line that's nasty today i find myself inside of a mini cooper countryman and this is like a redemption video because i actually filmed with this exact car just over a month ago and unfortunately that footage was corrupted but uh i'm back better than ever ready to make a video with the countryman finally and i just want to start this video off by saying i will be comparing this a little bit to both my well to my clubman video to my bass mini cooper s video as well as to my x1 video which is actually the most similar car to this based on the exact same platform so i will link all three of those videos down in the description box below and i'll also put cards up to them periodically throughout the video but yeah i will be referring to them and i will be comparing this a bit to the x1 again in particular but just to what else is available within either the mini range or just in general kind of in this price range for a small german british crossover so uh remember to like this video if you enjoy the content and subscribe if you want to see more stuff like this and without further ado let's get out onto the road all right so uh setting off here in the base countrymen first things first the most glaring characteristic and factor of this uh base countryman is the engine so i want to knock that off straight off the bat uh it's a lethargic power plant at best it's a 1.5 liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing a whopping 134 horsepower and pound-feet of torque so nothing to write home about and it is the weakest link i think of this particular car i mean overall decent chassis built on a solid platform obviously front-wheel drive biased uh in this case just front wheel drive even when you get the all four up to the jcw it only comes in all four uh it's still front wheel drive biased but not a bad car except not a lot of power 0-60 happens in nine seconds which again you know i'm not saying people are looking to buy this for the sake of driving a sporty car but i also understand that we're in a world now where a lot of basic suvs do zero 60 faster than nine seconds i think a jeep wrangler does 060 a couple seconds faster than nine seconds or at least around seven or eight seconds so this is a little on the slower side in that regard and i think if you want to cut two seconds off that 0-60 time you definitely should spend the extra money and go for the s model in fact i typically tend to believe that throughout the entire mini range those s models are kind of that sweet spot between options performance and price but nonetheless this happens to be an oxford edition so some of you might know what that means and i'm going to explain what it means but basically before i explain i will say that it is a tremendous value proposition to get an oxford edition and because this particular car is an oxford edition i'll make the claim to say hey you know what if you want to grab an oxford edition then maybe you should go ahead and get a countryman over say a countryman s or another model in the range so what does the oxford edition get you well the oxford edition actually used to be a package only available to either i think current college students or recent college grads and i think as of maybe a year or so ago they've switched that to allow anyone able to buy one i know there are some caveats with the oxford program like or the oxford edition program where you aren't able to either get another any other additional discount on the car any sort of other incentive applied they're used to not let you lease them i think you can lease them now but again i think the price is what it is but what does that mean so a base countryman starts at just over 29 000 and the oxford edition gives you a credit of six hundred dollars reducing the price of this particular car after options and destination to just over twenty seven thousand dollars so that's right two thousand dollars less than the normal starting price of a base countryman that's fantastic and along with that reduced price you actually get led headlights up front with the drls to go all the way around auto high beam it's delightful great nighttime light performance you get the led tail lights that give you the union jack insignia in them just like most of the mini in fact the entire mini range now at least has optional uh and then you get the larger screen here on the inside you get the pano sunroof you get the black headliner i mean blacked out wheels 18 inches uh the rubber this is a base countryman it's 225 all season rubber another weak point but this is a slow crossover so i'll give it a pass here but the point is you get a pretty solid package for the price for the money for sure in my opinion [Music] now the thing is that base engine it's paired to an eight-speed acen i believe is how you pronounce it automatic which is an okay transmission it's not nearly as good as either any sort of zf8 speed or the dual clutch seven speeds in some of the other mini lineup or models in the lineup and i found that this level of power is really not enough to push a sub 3 000 pound car around very fast or very quickly and here at around 3 500 pounds it it does have a hard time and there are many points in which i'm merging into a faster speed major road or onto the highway where i'm like oof this is really not enough power and i feel concerned the car behind me is gonna i'm not not gonna hit me but just catching up to me annoyed with me and that i don't feel that in most cars i drive these days obviously i certainly don't feel it in a fast or quick car but even in your typical say q5 you don't feel that anymore so the fact that you're doing this a little disappointing but this is kind of where i want to start comparing this car to the x1 because there are some pros and cons between the two again they're built on the same platform but they have very different characters and a slightly different experience thus because of those characters so i drove an x1 which i'll link up above or put a card to and i found it to be a decent experience but there were a couple big drawbacks the first one is price where this is 27 000 just about that was nearly 40 000. i think it was 39 and changed just under 40 000 that's a sizable difference in price now for that difference you do happen to get a good bit more power actually almost 100 more horsepower and also a little bit more torque so it's not for nothing and that particular car actually happened to be an x drive i believe so it had that front-wheel drive bias all-wheel drive system that you can get in the all four version of the countrymeter country and s but and you get standard in jcw but uh it was an option on that car so another advantage adds more weight but still um i just found that on one hand the interior felt like the most disappointing bmw interior i've ever been in where this feels like a really nice mini interior my expectations are a bit less on the price is a bit less on top of that this interior has a bit more character you have that light that goes around the central screen everything is circular your gauges are a little funky which i want to get into in a second but you have the funky gauges you have this gray colored trim midway across your kind of center stack area so you get some charm in here on the exterior you get the mini cooper look and provenance that maybe you're into i'm guessing if you're buying one of these you're into or considering one of these you're into it's polarizing but for those who like it they do like it a lot in fact love it and those who don't well it's another story for another day but the thing that i found that i really didn't like about the x1 was that almost any time someone pulled up alongside you in another bmw they were in a nicer bmw than you because there's something to say about the badge appeal of a bmw over a mini obviously bmw owns mini but having a bmw badge on your steering wheel having one up front on your hood people some people like that they want to say hey i have a bmw but when you have an x1 and then someone has an x3 or an x5 or an x7 i'm not saying you should care but sometimes you think well that must be even nicer where in a countryman i'm not saying this is better than any other mini but it's more equal to the rest of the range even a hardtop s doesn't really seem like this superior car to this although of course a more sporty fun experience and i did drive one of those too which i'll link up above i love that that's like my bread and butter mini cooper experience is a ideally a manual s hard top actual hard top coupe whatever you want to call it no convertible but you know two door but i'll still i still take the even the seven speed dual clutch i'll take that over this but that kind of explains where my head space is at it's not that i'm against the x1 it's just that i feel like for 12 000 or less i'm okay with this being a little slower having a bit more charming character and uh still offering you most of the amenities you still have the led headlights and tell us you still have a decent screen here the one thing i did notice is really really really really sucky in here is the audio system it's really bad very poor and it's not nearly as good as a base bmw system so i think that car i drove it's been a while so i don't remember if you had the harman kardon or if i had the base system but even the base system in that x1 is better than the base system here where the harman kardon audio is deeply deeply missed and the clubman i drove which i can also link up to at some point that did have the look let's floor it off the land look at this kind of slow i can't even beat this lexus es and there's an old wow i can't make it up probably an 80 year old lady driving that and i couldn't beat her off the line that's nasty in a 2014 lexus es350 but yeah the point is very slow um but the clubman had the harman kardon audio system and i really really missed that also that club menace had a jb4 piggyback tune which gives you very minimal power gains but about 30 40 horsepower and puts you right around where the jcw models used to be in the 220 230 range so that feels a lot faster than this when they're about the same weight maybe that weighs 50 pounds more than this 100 pounds more than this because of the bigger engine but boy with nearly 230 horsepower at the crank versus 135 it's a difference it's a difference you really feel someone who wants a brand new mini cooper with some nice amenities this large screen on the inside the sunroof the led headlights you're getting a lot of value out of the oxford pack but i do want to mention one thing which is that the mini cooper countryman was face lifted both in 2021 which is actually this car's model year as well as in 2022 the models that are now hitting dealers although scarce and hard to find in the current car market with the chip shortage but i wanted to explain what the facelift in general brought and what the slight second facelift within one model year's prop so this 2021 car on the exterior is identical to a 2022 car you get the exact same refreshed front fascia with the new headlights you get the new tail lights a couple other little tweaks but really that front fascia has been a little bit revised to keep up with the rest of the mini cooper lineup on the inside you get the new screen here that's a little bit more flush and that's kind of and you get the new shifter here for the automatic transmission and that is all again in line with 2021 and 2022 mechanically identical the only difference and i have driven the 2022 hardtop s so you can check that to see the footage maybe i'll inlay it here is that a 2022 model would have a different steering wheel and different gauge cluster which would be that semi semi-digital cluster in the 2022 and the steering wheel without this weird engrave and it's a bit thicker chunkier and it has well the button layout is the same but the buttons are flat um actually as much as i like that new steering wheel i don't like this engrave and i like the chunkier component the buttons are a little bit more inset here and i don't find myself pressing them by accident where on that steering wheel in the hard top s especially with some spirited driving i was constantly pressing them and it was driving me crazy now before we wrap the video up we gotta jump into a quick tall boy test and discuss some of the practicality of this car and we'll be done so here's the tallboy test [Music] so to wrap the video up some of the strengths of the countryman in general and this would be true regardless of engine although the clubman only comes in the s and the jcw but still nonetheless some of the advantages are you do have a much larger greenhouse here while i like that low wide kind of long look of the clubman more than this certainly and i even like the driving experience that slightly different dynamic it kind of provides you get better visibility out of this no question about it that rear window is much larger your side windows are a bit larger again you just have more of a greenhouse some more space you feel a little bit more spacious or whatever comfortable you sit higher up so you feel like you're in a crossover or even an suv actually more so than even the x1 but certainly a lot more so than either a hard top or a clubman even because the clubman's about the same height as a hard top so you get that extra size and feel but that also translates to a bit more legroom and headroom in the back so someone i would say some of my size at about six two would feel much more comfortable sitting in the back of this than the clubman and there's not even a question about how uncomfortable the back of either a two-door or four-door hardtop is in comparison other than that i mean this is a car that i like i know some people disagree and think it's a goofy car and i would take a clubman over this and then i would take a hard top over that and so on and so forth but if i had to pick between a an x1 or a mini cooper country i would probably go with the countryman for the character and charm it provides and if you want to kind of hit that middle price point between an x1 and a base countryman it's a countryman s it gives you almost the power output or basically effectively the performance of the next one still going to cost less money and it's going to have a bit more charm and quirkiness which you might as well have you're driving a small crossover you're not driving some sort of big luxo suv and you're not driving some sort of sporty rally type vehicle like a gla 45 for instance so you might as well buy in have some fun this is a cool car for what it is just very slow but i've enjoyed driving it and if you guys enjoyed the video please remember to

11;Mini;2022 Mini Countryman;2022 Mini Cooper Countryman ALL4: Close But No Cigar;[Laughter] [Music] do [Music] what's going on guys and welcome back to the hungry road my name is eric and thank you again for tuning in i appreciate you sticking around with me this week's rental is the 2022 mini cooper countryman this is the all four so it is all wheel drive but we'll get to some of those specs later so i did something a little different this week i actually drove the car to my site usually i fly in and i get the rental car at the airport but this week i was in connecticut and that's why i picked this guy up at the bradley international airport and there were these available there was this beautiful ice blue metallic one and a british racing green one i like the blue better so i got the blue so let's go over some of the features some of the cool things uh some of the things that i would like to talk about and show off and um yeah let's see let's get started so let me give you some brief history here the mini corporation made its debut in 1969 but the name mini had been using other models up to 10 years before that until bmw purchased the rover group in 2000 which included the mini corporation as well as land rover which was then sold off to ford and we don't know what happened with that currently on the market mini offers seven different varieties the two-door mini the four-door mini the countryman mini the clubman mini which is like an elongated station wagon version of this car here then there's the two-door convertible then there's the electric car and there's the john cooper works editions of all of those trims but this one here again is the countryman an ice blue metallic with the all four and signature package so the all four gives you all-wheel drive and this signature package gives you heated seats gives you touch screen interface for your infotainment system gives you the bigger 18 inch wheels up from 17 inch and dual zone climate it costs you about an extra 3 000 but i think it's absolutely worth it but you only get the measly 132 horsepower if you don't have the s or the john cooper works edition engines so 1.5 liter three cylinder turbo if you get the s model or if you get the john coop works edition you get a bigger engine you get a two liter single turbo three cylinder which gives you a lot more horsepower so the s model will give you 192 horsepower which gets your zero to 60 up from 9.6 seconds to 7.6 seconds the john cooper works edition will give you a 4.9 second zero to 60 and that's much faster and feels more like a regular car than this one does here but like many cars these days you do have the hands-free option of getting into the tailgate here kick your foot very quickly underneath the middle of the car and the trunk will open all by itself it is fully motorized but inside the trunk it's not that big so on the website they advertise like i said earlier seats for five and all your luggage pretend i'm all your luggage if you watch a tesla video you will know the unit of measurement i use is an arab d weaver so now i'm in the trunk here and i'm pretty sure it won't close let's see as you can see five pieces of luggage does not fit in the mini cooper and if you're stuck in here it won't shut on you to close it do the same thing or you can press the buttons up here so you have an option to close the trunk without locking it or you can press the lock button here and it will close the lid and lock it to open the hood pull the lever on the driver's side foot well wants to unlock the hood again to unlatch the hood then you can walk around the front of the vehicle and lift the hood right up without having a fumble looking for latches and all kinds of stuff so this is your key here it's a very simple key fob i do love the design of it it's very different very rounded like the rest of the car is mini logo on the back there unlock button at the top mini logo in the middle is the lock button trunk button is the third one down here but if you happen to battery dies and you get locked out your car there's a silver button on the side press that silver button and you can release the hard key here put this key into the slot down here in the bottom all the way in that's in and you can just take off the silver panel here remove the key stick your key in turn counterclockwise you will see the locking mechanism rise up here remove the key and then you can open the door i would call the interior a very modern retro if that makes any sense at all so what i mean is that we have things like toggle switches you know from like old school airplanes and machinery back in the day but we have this giant led ring around the outside and an eight-inch touchscreen here which has your hazards up here at the top parking features right here you can turn off and on some of the features there turn it back off get back to the home menu we have our radio stations down here in the bottom volume control there climate control right here and watch what happens to this led ring when i start to adjust the temperatures right now it's at 60 degrees if i turn it up the ring now displays a cute color combo and as i turn the temperature up to 81 degrees the white light over here is over there on the hot side turn it back close toward the medium and the blue over here say this happen to the passenger side over there yeah same thing now just the fan speed it gives me a different sort of uh display here i mean this is just so cool it's so responsive it's just so unique i haven't seen any of the car that does anything like that i hit the heated seats no nothing okay but to start the car you put your foot on the brake and you flick this either down hope to turn the car off or flick it up to start it auto stop start here click that and it should light up there let you know auto stop start is off and you can just flick it back if you want it on charging controls right here to put the car in gear put your foot on the brake press the thumb in on the left side here and pull the knob all the way back so now the car isn't drive with the green light illuminated by the d you want to go into neutral just pushing forward one time goes into neutral then you get a message here about securing the vehicle before it rolls and if you want to put it in reverse hold the button in push all the way forward then we have the reverse light lit up next to the r to put it in park or press the p button but first we'll check out the reverse camera pretty pretty cool one more thing i did want to show you that i noticed earlier let's back up into these trees and watch what that screen see the screen starts to freak out when you get close to stuff so he's orange orange red yeah so i want you to stop but we'll drive back out of this mess i don't want to have any problems here and to put the car in park foot on the brake press to pee and it goes in the park i must admit as cute as this car is these door handles are a little weird i'm used to being able to put my hand through and pull something and then pull the door open but instead you have to reach and pull backwards to open the door so you can kind of see the mechanism there just looks a little strange so i'm used to grabbing it my wrist is all twisted and stuff and pulling it open but and you would get used to it up top here we have some more cute toggle switches the two on the far left and right will control your lights you just click it once the light comes on click it again the light goes off if you click this one here all the lights come on so one two three clicking for it to go off and we see these green dots right here this one controls your ambient lighting settings so if you scroll through them it'll change blue a deeper blue almost indigo purple fuchsia red orange yellow green yellow orange green i mean there's so many colors here and the ambient light is reflected down here in the door well so there we go that's a blue light blue you can just kind of scroll through these seemingly forever but obviously it looks much better in the night time so here's a better look at the ambient lighting we got the red got the orange yellow orange yellow [Music] lime green green super green blue purple and all the colors are here so you can kind of cycle through these at will but it's really cool the last taco switch in the middle here does control your panoramic sunroof so you do need to open the moonroof first and slide the netting back manually but then if you toggle this one more time the roof does slide back on its own now the rear roof back here isn't motorized or anything as you can see the top roof slides over that one so you open that when they would run into each other but you do get plenty of air coming in through here you have a diffuser up here to block the wind or make you know reduce the noise that comes with the car but if you want to close it press it forward the roof will come back press it again to lower the moon roof and seal it there we go the seats in the mini cooper countrymen are not motorized you can get a motorized if you option up for the iconic pack which is another seventy eight hundred dollars which comes with a lot more features but that's neither hit right there we do have a lever in the front to move the seat forward and back you pull up here and you slide it while you're sitting in the seat we have this guy here if you pull it up it raises the seat if you push on it it lowers it back down i mean it's a little cumbersome and tedious but it gets the job done how often are you really moving your seat so we just have a fairly versatile armrest here hold the button lift up on the top half of the armrest we have facing two ketchups 75 cents there's a nice rubber mat down here so things don't slide all around everywhere close this and now you have an adjustable armor you have more space down in here you put several phones no pads pins whatever but i can always like this is too low a little bit now it's sit up here or somewhere in the middle so we are inside the 2022 mini cooper countryman as i said before i've already put about a thousand miles on this car here so i can give you a pretty quick synopsis of what i think about it so i do have a little uh stretch of road here i'm gonna be able to punch it or feather it because that's all the power this engine has all right i'm at a stoplight i'm foot is to the floor foot is bought is pedaled to the metal right now 45 miles an hour 49 52 55 finally 60. like that's terrible but if you're not out here to be driving fast and whipping it like a race car then you may not need all that power but i do because it's more fun a wise philosopher once said all those who drive fast are not in a hurry i said that i'm the wise philosopher but aside from that the ride it's like a car it's a little softer than a car but it's not giant ford f-150 floating above cloud type saw you do feel the bumps the suspension is moderate like everything's fine the steering is decent rather tight i love the feel of the steering wheel it's nice and thick unlike my ford taurus i have at home it's a lot thinner it's always weird when i get in and grab it but yeah this is a comfortable steering wheel the ride's decent like you know this is an average car but you're paying kind of for like the background bmw name because you know bmw makes the mini well yeah the features are here you know it's a decent ride all right we got a better pov angle here let's roll these windows up over here they are all automatic foot on the brake press a little button and we pull out and let's get this going so as we're coming to a red light here one of the uh more annoying things about the car is the stop start feature so yes it's economical to have it on or whatever so now we are at a red light my foot goes all the way on the brake as you can see the rpm has dropped to the ready section so the engine is off right now but i'm gonna turn the auto stop start off and you can hear the car kick back into life but i don't feel the engine moving and when i go to accelerate or take off it still feels like the auto stop start is still on i don't know if that's because of the lack of horsepower or the way the engine is set up or if they really want you to have an auto stop start on but it just doesn't feel like the engine's on when i go to take off and you'll see here in a second all right see what i mean like there's that hesitancy of when you go to put your foot on the gas from the brake and just doesn't feel like the engine's on and still feel like the engine had to start up and then then you could continue on but that is one thing i i am annoyed with this car i mean granted yeah i got great gas mileage average about 30 miles a gallon on the way here from connecticut 16 gallon tank did 500 and it felt like 550 miles or well over half the trip on one tank of gas and i think that's pretty good but yeah i mean that little stop start it's not you're not saving that much gas it's the three liter 1.5 cylinder engine that saves the gas another thing that bugs me about this car is the way the cruise control and the speed limiter are set up so if you look at my left hand here the middle button is cruise control i'm going to turn it on for 55 miles an hour and i'm going to press the positive sign which sets it so now it's set at 60. let's say i want to decrease it i can press the bottom button down one click is a mile per hour if i give it a good click it goes down five miles per hour but let's say i want to speed up which i usually do on a highway i give it a couple good clicks but the speed limiter button is right here to the right of the cruise control so there have been many instances of on the drive here from connecticut where i've tried to speed up and i've pressed the limiter button and as you can see i just did it so now my speed is limited at 60 miles an hour but i really want to go 65 so now i'm trying to increase the speed so now i've set the limiter to 80 miles an hour but cruise control has been turned off so now i need to go back turn the limiter off press cruise control and it gets set back down to what i was just doing so i got to click it up again and then we have this this be you know this it says i'm nitpicking a little bit but it happened numerous times maybe because i got fat fingers people you thin fingered people out there it might not happen to y'all but it happened to me numerous times so that's just one thing i didn't like is the limiter is right next to the cruise control who even wants a speed limiter like what is even a point i guess if you're a speed demon not in this car though you can't be a speed demon in this car here's p demon and you gotta limit yourself then you can put the limiter on but whatever so let's talk more about this led display right here so in your display menu you have what's called the center instrument option that is what this is here you click on it and there's different ways you can have it set up so there's different events that will trigger this thing to move the heartbeat is a little red pulsing thing right here when you first turn the car on your parking assistant is when i demonstrated the car backing into something your telephone so you have a phone call it will react to your phone call i mean all these different things are the climate which i mentioned earlier that had the uh turning this right here this is your climate and your tone which is the volume it does the same thing for that so it's really cool but then there's the basic display which you can leave on ambient lighting which i have right now or you can go down to color scheme and you can turn it to uh like red for sport mode and there's another one called uh blue for lounge but you can also turn it off or if you want the engine speed to be displayed here you can do that so right now the car is in auto stop start off but i have my red line over here and the rest of this right here is going to be the rpm so get ready to leave the light right now energy kicked in so here's a little white thing here let's mash it look how cool that is i love this little display and if that's no not enough for you or too much for you you can just put it on engine speed and now your speedometer is here this is so cool i think my favorite one would be the ambient lighting especially at night or the engine speed because you're getting like a little tachometer right here in the middle of your screen or your dashboard in conclusion this car sunroof is big enough to fit me through it and that's a hefty sunroof and i got moon play around but i was left unimpressed with this car i loved the styling loved the color loved the interior loved the features i love how retro modern it was the toggle switches and the led lights and the ambient lighting and the sound system and the leather i love all those things i was just missing the power so maybe i got the wrong model maybe the s model or the john cooper works editions would be better fit for me because i need the power and the luxuries now you're looking at a 40 45 000 price tag compared to this one here it's in about 35. so i enjoyed the car if you guys guys get a chance to rent one yourself or test one out please do so let me know what you think but remember there's never an empty tank or an empty stomach on this road i'm getting really close to my subscriber goal of 500 i'll be giving away your 101 or one of you who's paying attention stay safe guys and thank you again for [Music] watching [Music] [Music] wanna see something satisfying
12;Mini;2021 Mini Countryman;2021 MINI Cooper S Countryman Review - Behind the Wheel;when you make an investment on an automobile you want it to be able to do everything but unfortunately there are limitations for instance well you can't expect the same automobile to be able to accomplish say carry an extra thousand kilos of weight corner like it's a tron light cycle and still be as luxurious as a rolls royce so let's be practical say you're looking for something stylish uh a little bit on the luxurious side definitely sporty and well something that's kind of practical this is the 2021 mini cooper s countryman sport now i know it's german and english at the same time but it's aiming to be the swiss army knife of crossovers aiming to do everything with enough versatility to be the perfect daily drive and more importantly a lot of fun on the weekends [Music] they're that strong up front on the countryman it has a very familiar mini face though it does ditch the round lights that are found on other minis down the range but it's still undeniably a mini touches of chrome add a little razzle dazzle so to speak now i'm not the biggest fan of chrome trim but here it fits the upscale vibes this crossover gives off it's got a very aggressive front bumper that house led fog lamps as well as slats located here and on the other side that actually work no faker here another aspect that drives home the sport name are these 19-inch two-tone jcw wheels which look absolutely great unfortunately it does provide for well a stiffer ride but we'll get to that a little bit later ground clearance is at a healthy 165 millimeters definitely more than enough for conquering the urban jungle but certainly not confidence inspiring when it comes to much much rougher terrain this also is only a front-wheel drive so paired with that don't expect to be dominating the dakar rally autodeal.com.ph can connect you to get the best quote from multiple dealerships and near you you can request and compare quotes from any dealership in the philippines get the best deal with autodeal yes it's got a small frame but if you open the boot with either your kick assist or power tailgate you're looking at 450 liters of space now that's a lot and it can even maximize itself to almost 1 500 liters when you fold the second road down there is no lift to speak of so loading heavy things is not a problem and then there's also this it's a cheap thrill but i love it so darn much space in the rear cabin of the mini is actually plenty decent you've got space definitely for two average the large size adults a third one would be a problem because the tunnel is actually quite high and elbow room is nothing great the seats themselves are firm and supportive but i wish they had a bit more bolstering because this is a minion you're definitely going to be sliding around during your weekend warrior sessions comfort is okay when it comes to leg room because that's my normal driving position even if jack were sitting and driving up there i definitely have enough leg room luxury back here it's actually not bad you've got your own yes your own sunroof and then you've got air vents you've got charging points that are type c and you've got a center armrest with two cup holders coupled with ball holders on either door now i did mention that this is a practical automobile and it goes to show you that by folding over so you have access to the rear which is actually pretty darn cool the front space of the countryman is actually pretty great it's actually pretty exceptional it's got a lot of character and makes it well very unique you've got for instance a lot of toggles instead of buttons which include your ignition as well then there's also your drive mode selectors sunroof control and others these toggles really make for a unique experience in here another quirk in the automobile that you can't miss is the round housing that you find in the center for its infotainment screen now it's not just all lights and display they actually have a function for instance the lights change color and come on when you're in reverse and you're getting close to uh certain obstacles on the road then it also changes depending on your drive modes whether you're sport or in eco and then there's also one of the lights that turn on when it's well you use it as a tachometer it's not the most accurate but i guess it's just fun to look at the downside though is that the screen is a total of six and a half inches which is at this price point really you expect much more from the automobile i mean even an anova has got a larger screen but it does serve its purpose inside a very tiny cabin and the functionality of it is actually great in here though you get a system based on bmw's idrive with the quirky touch of mini here and there the main menu echoes other elements of the interior by being well a circle i guess going through the menu is quick and snappy there's definitely a learning curve for sure but it's no rocket science navigating the system there is unfortunately no carplay or android auto but connecting your phone to the system through usb or bluetooth and it allows you to search and choose what you want to listen to through spotify and other music apps speaking of music there are harman kardon speakers in here which make for a great listening experience though the eq controls leave something to be desired in contrast another highlight up here are the leather seats the leather is very darn good with some alcantara-like material on the side and the bolstering to support you when you're going through turns is actually pretty good you've also got an extension that you can bring out for much taller passengers for thigh support i can't relate but i thought i just mentioned that in terms of cubby holes well you've got two cup holders and bottle holders in either door space for one possibly even two phones down there and then you've got space here and a center armrest with all of jack's stuff ah and another touch is the ambient lighting in here you can change it to match whatever mood that you're in hopefully blue when you're stuck in traffic keep chill keep chill [Music] very unique inside and out i'm happy to report that the drive of the countryman itself is also as unique uh depending on really what you're looking for it can be good or bad allow me to explain for starters or rather for instance would be the steering it's uh it's a very good steering it's very weighted it's very direct the inputs are very sharp and you'll notice that it's very easy to drive inside the city the thing about it is regardless of its size you're still thinking that you're purchasing a crossover which you are essentially so for more people that are looking for a more relaxed drive yeah this might not be for you however if you can bear with the weighted steering and it's something that you're looking forward to especially when you get out of town and to have a little fun and if you've got the coin well yeah pick one up immediately the countryman does weigh a little bit more than 4500 pounds which is a bit on the heavy side but it is powered by a 2-liter twin turbo that produces 192 horses and 280 newton meters of torque now to put that into perspective it would be like putting the fight of a great white shark into a goldfish imagine that that being said it's not exactly the kind of power that will tear your face off as you're going back or rather forward in time i get that thing confused what i'm trying to say is that the power kicks in roughly at the top end of the rev range so it's smooth till about to get there now getting off the line if you're punchy and you're in a bit of a hurry it does tend to well slide a little bit because it's not an all-wheel drive it's a front-wheel drive but the transmission i gotta say is actually pretty smooth whether you're on sport or eco motor green whatever it is that they call it it's actually very seamless i like the way that it changes gears without ever having to bother you and knocking on your door and saying excuse me would you like to go up or down up or down no it just keeps going it drives like a proper crossover it really does now the suspension does help mitigate the body roll by a lot i gotta add though that if you're a person who is much older in their days more seasoned shall we put it and you're not looking for something that's a bit bouncy because you obviously want to get yourself a proper crossover then this might be the kind of car that you will want to skip because well it's not exactly a jcw works car out right but the suspension and the 19 inch tires with the 45 series on them yeah that might get old really fast really really quick if you're looking for a much more comfortable car now for those that are more uh shall we say spry and want to get out there and carve some twists and turns on the weekends or maybe even on a daily basis yeah look no further technology in here is actually pretty darn good you feel like you haven't been left behind by science and technology but that being said it's like you're spending so much on this automobile and yet it kind of cuts a few corners for instance we made mention that the display is not the biggest thing on the planet it's only six and a half inches while the housing is just so massive another is that it does have cruise control but it's not adaptive and i'm thinking for the price that i'm paying for this guy well darn it i should be spoiled right we should be nvh is not well particularly good i'd give it about an eight out of ten because the wind and tire noise definitely creep in the engine noise not a problem regardless of how much you're pushing it or how deep you're putting your right foot down on the loud pedal but the wind noise and the road noise yeah that might start getting to you so basically nvh or the noise vibration and harshness in here can be quite harsh actually depending on how you push the car the other thing that's quite harsh but in a good way are the brakes man do they bite and they'll catch you off guard too very surprising because when you step on it it's like it'll stop the car like there's snow tomorrow it's as shocking as let's say for example answering back your mother when you do it you're like oh man that's a bit scary maybe i shouldn't have done that they're that strong now when it comes to field economy if you're thinking that it should be good in a car like this you're spot on because in traffic inside the city you're doing 10 kilometers per liter good even better on the highway double it at 20 kilometers per liter thanks obviously to its 8-speed automatic transmission that's just awesome man anyway that you put it we're gonna be very critical about this automobile for two things number one is because well of its price and number two it's because well it's a mini saying that it's a crossover let's not mince words when you get this yes sure it definitely is a crossover i mean it fits the bill but it's still definitely a mini and you're gonna buy it simply because well it's a go-cart with an air conditioning system with a radio and a boot to boot so you're still gonna expect that roughness from it that those sharp turns the engine that revs really high and a bit of a bouncy ride with 45 series tires because well that's why you're getting it it's all of that and a bag of potato chips to the right buyer so it seems that the countryman is targeting a very specific fire one who wants all the amenities and the drivability of a mini and yet still have the capabilities of a crossover essentially trading off passenger comfort for driving performance so i guess the question is is it any good one to the right person it's not just good but it's actually great because well it's full of character inside and up and despite being full of german handiwork all over the automobile it also has the charm of dry british humor to be honest with you it's brilliant the mini cooper countryman sport comes in at three million eight hundred and fifty thousand philippine pesos i didn't make a mistake that's really its price and i know what you're thinking at that figure you can get yourself already a cx-9 which is a hell of a lot bigger more ground clearance and much more comfortable inside so really it's practicality like a swiss army knife is you know that's out the window but i will tell you three definite things about it number one is that it's absolutely fun to drive no doubt about that number two it's obviously an object of desire every single person that i've met well most of the people that i've met definitely want a mini and number three it's as sharp as a razor's edge no doubt [Music] you
13;Mini;2021 Mini Countryman;2021 Mini Countryman Review // This or BMW X1?;it's nimble it's quick it's entertaining to drive oh me the mini okay we have the countryman and it's one of those vehicles that kind of gets under your skin and once you own one you want to own another one we'll tell you why looks like the camera is so far away the windshield is so far away from where you're sitting it's like so we're wait this is actually the top of the the dashboard yeah all right that's crazy so you're in a mini countryman the least mini of the minis the least minis it's getting bigger exactly what's under the hood of this thing a two-liter four-cylinder turbo engine with an eight-speed automatic transmission 189 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque it's all-wheel drive so that's what's under the hood but what do you get with the key standard features the cooper s countryman base model comes with an 8.8 inch full color screen 6-way manual front sport seats side bolsters and thigh extension 3 spoke leather steering wheel led headlights dual exhaust tailpipes 18-inch wheels all four all-wheel drive dynamic stability control and cruise control there's some buttons here it looks

motormouth to become an expert member and get extra searches the link is in the description below no andrea we're going to talk a little bit about reliability but we have two sets of friends that are mini diehards people that own these they love them and they keep coming back for more do they ever love them we have friends who have traded it in got a new one others have purchased it they've crammed into a two-door with a family of four and they keep coming back for more they just don't care about reliability they just think it's such a great looking vehicle yeah so the one set of friends they had a cooper for 12 years both daughters learned to drive on them they used them when they went to school and so so on and they just traded it in recently and got this exact car the country means so they went to the biggest of the minis yeah something a little bit bigger for them it is great for a family of four in here there's plenty of space i mean it's really the x1 platform so reliability is an issue i mean you're not going to get the same kind of reliability you get with a lexus definitely let's just be honest here but i call it the pain pleasure matrix so does this vehicle give you enough pleasure with the driving dynamics the fun factor the sporty engine to put up with some misery having to take it back to the dealer once in a while are you willing to put up with that to have this car yeah i think a lot of people are for sure i mean our friends who have this mini countryman also own a range rover and they're heading to the shop for that one too obviously there is something to that zach for sure and this car obviously that kind of personality obviously thanks to the driver they're into the pain part maybe they're the sadists maybe maybe there's something to that i just think it's a really kind of an exciting drive to it it has plenty of power it's good so we're just giving you anecdotal information on this you have to decide for yourself but there really isn't anything on the road that has this combination no and this got a bit of a refresh nothing too exciting but it does have a little bit more of a rugged look it has a bigger grill black accents throughout and then it also has the cool looking taillights which is a bit of a nod to their british heritage well they call these typically facelifts i wouldn't call this a facelift i would call it maybe a botox injection with a little bit of with a few fillers it's not really a phase lift right inside there's a few changes as well now under the front row seat you get a little bit more room for your feet so in the back you can really stretch out the back seat slides front and back up to 13 centimeters and the cargo space has 450 liters of space in it so it's a pretty good size this country man so don't think of this as a mini like a small car this is the fastest growing segment in the auto industry the new small suv class so so many people buy the x1 it's you know pound per pound dollar for dollar it's about the same right yeah but cooler cooler so we went through the key standard features and you might notice that something is missing a heated steering wheel is not available on any trim nor is android auto no android auto are you kidding me it's canada people we need a heated steering wheel apparently bmw mini are listening because uh heated steering wheel is being added for a model year 2020. oh good stuff why would you take that out so you don't get a lot with the base model but one up from the base model it's the classic trim and that's where you get heated seats the panoramic sunroof and the premiere one up from the classic you get keyless entry the automatic trunk electric front seats otherwise it's manual and apple carplay you know what andrea bmw and mini they want you to part with your money a lot of those things honestly should be included in a premium brand i think it's kind of cheeky now the one thing i really dislike about this car is that digital instrument cluster looks like somebody bought it on amazon for 49.99 just stuck it it's just the cheapest crappiest looking digital instrument cluster you just think about what kia is offering in their cars oh unbelievable the koreans are offering gorgeous digital instrument clusters they're offering beautiful touch screens i think we both agree the interior needs some sort of a refresh but the exterior i think is good the way it is you know who needs a refresh zork time now for questions coffee and cars your questions from instagram love the color by the way it's sage green did you get a chance to drive the previous gen countryman s if so do you see any big improvements that stick out in terms of performance and drivability um i don't it's like a mini yeah it drives like a mini drives the same there's just been a few tweaks mostly to the exterior of this oh by the way this looks great to me um people because i'm colorblind people always ask what do you see i don't see green in this at all no there's a little bit of a gray undertone but it's green all i see is all i see is gray this is one expensive mini how well does the infotainment function the center stack looks crowded and the display screen looks small does it have a touch screen yes it has a touch screen oh they did make a point when they when i picked it up they said oh it's got new soft touch buttons so when you hit the buttons now oh stop that we don't want to we don't want a copyright strike yeah somebody had it on chill that wasn't you no i don't like chill i am chill here's the problem with mini in my opinion they are handcuffed to this design you know whenever they have a new reveal at an auto show i don't need to go and look because they know exactly what it's going to look like it's going to look like a mini yeah and then on the inside it's got this big you know retro inspired dial in the middle i don't love it i like it but i think as you said it's hard to make a change when everybody expects a mini to look like this i love the exterior but if you want a more modern interior i'm not sure a lot of mini buyers would love that maybe they like this retro lot so back to the question this is owned by bmw you basically get the i drive functionality from bmw in that so that is good yes is there better value with the x1 or this many countrymen well the x one starts at just under forty thousand dollars but the thing is the base model doesn't come with a lot so you have to get the premium neither does this no no not the same with this you have to get the premium package which has the panoramic sunroof and the heated seats but i think you're coming in at around the same price to be honest with you probably around 45 46 000 so you get more power with the bmw but yes this has a different look and a different vibe the bmw is kind of plain looking this one is at least funky so you have to decide what you want go figure why there hasn't been an electric version of this yet so the mini does come with an electric version the regular cooper the right regular cooper and it gets up to 177 kilometers of electric range the countryman does have a hybrid version up to 40 kilometers of electric range not a whole lot on either of them but my bat is this countryman is going to be all over yeah just wait everything's going to be electrified for sure and that's it for us thanks for your questions all right if you want to get a question or follow along make sure you follow andrea's instagram it's motormouth underscore andrea and because you hear the music lots of pictures at night time it's night life [Music] no andrea i know you like to drive it and subscribe but i'm going to put it i'm putting it inside oh my gosh it sounds pretty good and your butt is very low to the ground yeah i mean it's the most unsuv suv you can buy i like it though it's so nimble quick fun what an entertaining drive so if you are somebody that likes to have fun behind the wheel you're like a nimble easy to throw around little package and um you don't want to give up the driving dynamics of a car this is about as close you're going to get i think it's terrific i'm really enjoying it it's been fun and i would actually be happy with this vehicle just because of the drive the interior why do you do that to me i'm going to put it on yours on max you know what he does to me sometimes he puts it on the ventilated cooling and i'm like oh why is it so cold only on cold days he tries to trick me i don't like it it sounds really good for 189 horsepower 207 pound-feet of torque you might not remember but many this is true mini used to have cvts no oh crap hola they were not good oh my god so this is crisp you you don't get paddle shifters you have to slide it over and yeah and do it manually in the center but i actually don't mind that it reminds me of driving like a regular manual sure but some people might miss the paddle shifters but here's the thing andrea for similar money do you want 228 horsepower or do you want 189 in this well you know i always like more horsepower and torque of course can i introduce you to an uh bmw x1 we can get you into this for low monthly payments yes i like the look of this better i kind of agree with you this is just a real standout exterior on the road it just has a cool vibe to it i take this now in questions coffee and cars we reference the price of the x1 so how does this one compare for your consideration four categories and four vehicles for you to consider the obvious first competitor is the bmw x1 with a turbocharged 2-liter 4-cylinder engine and an 8-speed automatic transmission 228 horsepower and a starting price of just under 40 thousand dollars next up the audi q3 it comes with a 2-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and an 8-speed automatic transmission it also has 228 horsepower it runs on regular gas and has a starting price of 39 250 dollars the mercedes-benz gla has a 2-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine also with an eight-speed automatic transmission 221 horsepower and a starting price of 42 and a half thousand dollars so the non-premium alternative we've gone with the new mazda cx-30 turbo 2.5 liter turbo four-cylinder engine only a six-speed automatic transmission however this has 250 horsepower and a starting price of just over 36 000 so there are four vehicles for you to consider so this does share components with bmw so let's see how much this one costs the countryman cooper s base model is almost 36 thousand dollars the classic trim is just over thirty eight thousand the premier 40 690 dollars and the premier plus forty three thousand three hundred and forty dollars price has tested just over forty seven thousand when it comes to fuel economy the countryman gets 10.4 liters per hundred kilometers in the city 7.5 on the highway that's 23 miles per gallon city and 31 miles per gallon highway now andrea we talked about how fun this thing is to drive but it does come with some downside it's not quiet no and it's a bit bumpy and a bit bumpy yeah so you have to like that i do like a bumpy ride as we know i do and it's nice to hear it doing something right yes i think there's something about it it's kind of special i would be happy with one i don't know if you would be i would like it as a second car yeah i really love the drive of the countrymen but they could work on the packaging a little bit the price goes up pretty fast and they're handcuffed by this design how do they move out of this shape how do they move away from this interior it's going to be interesting to see what they do in the years to come this video is brought to you by carcass canada get the dealer's cost list of rebates plus discounted interest rates use

14;Mini;2021 Mini Countryman;Is the BMW X2 Better than the MINI Countryman?;so some of you all remember a while back i did a video where i compared the bmw x1 to the mini countryman and i said why i felt the countryman was far superior to the x1 well i didn't compare it to the x2 yet so i figured it'd only fair that i actually get my hands on an x2 so that i could do this video and baron bmw was kind enough even though i'm going to be very critical of their car to let me use one of their bmw x2s so there it is there's the countryman in question and this is a comparison of the bmw x2 to the mini countryman [Music] so it seems only fitting that i would park the x2 in the shadows of the countrymen as i find the countryman far superior but i figured it only appropriate that i actually get these two together to show you all why the countryman is still better than the bmw counterpart now both of these vehicles ride on the uk l2 platform they are both front-wheel drive biased all-wheel drive systems whereas the bmw is using the x drive system while mini is using the all four system they are basically the same drive system yet as i've stated these two cars cannot be any more different and the reason why is the way they are engineered bmw touts themselves as being the ultimate driving machine mini doesn't do that but these two vehicles are basically the same car is the x2 better than the countryman or is it the other way around so let's start under the bonnet where these two cars are virtually identical this is the 2-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged b-46 motor in the mini countryman it puts out 189 horsepower this is the same b46 2-liter four-cylinder turbocharged motor except in the bmw this puts out 228 horsepower okay so the bmw already has a slight advantage over the countryman the engine bays look virtually identical so when i say they are virtually identical i mean that the air box is the same this strut brace is the same this brace right here is the same now why do i say that this is the bmw and here we are in the countryman the same brace the same air box the same frame so it's amazing with engineering and automobiles when they share platforms that parts on these cars are really quite similar and can transfer over from vehicle to vehicle these engines are basically identical but why is the bmw have more horsepower the reason for that is bmw owners want more horsepower they don't have the same horsepower as a mini so they bumped it up the 228 horsepower on this b46 is actually the same horsepower that's on the john cooper works hard top as the john cooper works hard top from 2020 onward uses the b46 engine now inside the cars they use the same transmission they both use an eight speed sport automatic however how they execute the interior fit and finish is of course quite different so this is the interior of a 2021 mini countryman typical mini fare you have the nice black pearl cloth interior you have the navigation system you have the eight speed automatic and you have a jcw steering wheel the new digital dash now as this is my first foray into a bmw let's see what we have in the x2 you get in here we have very similar styled seats actually a little bit more bolstering on the sides than you'd get in the countryman same power seat functions in fact they're pretty much identical now of course you're all saying that's complete sacrilege how can the bmw be identical to the mini well they're not obviously the styling of the seats is where it was similar the interior of the x2 is very very different for one this ipad looking screen that pops up out of the dash okay we got a nice menu here we got navigation simple control panel no cd player much like the mini very similar i can see some buttons that look like they're very similar to the other cars gauges are analog but this is a 2018 model so obviously it's going to be slightly different back seats of course are going to be very different so we're going to get into the bmw first and uh notice their excessive use of the bmw badge there are four bmw badges on this car two on the sides and one on the front and back but anyway this is the back seat now the seat cushion looks similar to the countryman in a way but let's see what it's like to actually sit in this car okay so i'm now sitting in the back seat of the bmw x2 now it's not bad although the ceiling of this car if i sit upright is um [Music] maybe a couple of inches from my head and that's a little claustrophobic for me so closing the door is not going to make it much better but it is very very tight back here i mean it's just it feels very very tight i don't know why other than the fact that's the styling of this car it is very very tight back here and i don't necessarily like that feeling on top of that look at that rear window now there is barely any visibility back there i mean barely any visibility i mean that is a really small rear window conversely climbing into the back seat of a mini countryman i have a lot more space there is at least four inches three or four inches of height between me and the roof of this car on top of that look at that rear window lots of visibility out there there is a lot of light coming through it's a lot easier to see the whole interior of the mini feels very very open very very spacious which is kind of odd given that these two cars ride on the same platform and share the same mechanicals but the styling is of course where things are completely different we've gone around the styling the only thing to do next really is to drive the um bmw x2 so uh let's do it so far so good now i can't see the fuel gauge down here so i haven't i can't even see my odometer really unless i tilt the steering wheel completely down into my lap then i can see it just fine but i want it right about there so if you have the steering wheel all the way up you're not going to see your odometer which is something the mini doesn't have an issue with we're going to take it on a quick loop around onto i-35 okay lane keep assist that's rather nice not that i need lane keep assist and onto the highway we go not too enamored with the blind spots at the back corners but my mirrors are adjusted just so and i don't think i have an issue there turn that off even in sport mode the acceleration feels very slow now in the countryman when you put the car in sport mode it actually adjusts the throttle response and the throttle response makes it more quick and this doesn't seem to be doing that now i apologize for the light flare in the corner that's because of where the camera is mounted that was the only place i could actually mount the camera in this car as it's a little bit lower profile it makes it a little bit difficult still can't see my odometer down there we're going to hop off onto antioch road so far my overall impressions are it drives fairly decent for a bmw it doesn't feel like a mini obviously but it does drive nicely now it's still not one of my favorite models but it's not bad we're back off the highway we're on a main city street it's kind of smooth very comfortable just as compliant as the countryman would be feels about the same really although the bumps are a little bit smoother it's really strange i'm not a fan of all bmws but i am a fan of some bmws i don't know how i feel about the x2 i really don't know how i feel about this car because it's just different given the fact that it's almost too many to be a bmw and what i mean by that is this car is so much a mini that it almost isn't a bmw it is a mini cooper countryman in bmw clothes which is really interesting and it is something that bmw people have said about the two series grand coupe is the fact that it feels very much it feels very much like a mini and not so much like a bmw now i closed the sunroof because we were getting some glare in here and it wasn't very comfortable it's not bad but the steering does feel a little bit more numb compared to the countryman the countryman it feels very responsive even though it's a similar electric style steering the x2 not so much now we're going to get on to this last leg of the miriam loop to go back to the dealership and do something that i normally do with my countrymen and i don't feel nearly as confident going around these corners in the bmw than i do in the mini that really did not feel pleasant to me that felt very nerve-wracking i don't know why and what's funny is this car has a slightly lower center of gravity and the fact that it has a shorter height in its body it sits shorter than the countryman so the fact that it feels less planted than the countryman is really saying a lot that was definitely an interesting feeling to go around that corner in a car that's built on the same platform and not feel like you're in total control the steering feels very responsive in sport mode but it also feels very electric it doesn't feel necessarily like it's actually connected to anything i know i know it's actually connected but it just feels very very different compared to the mini so basically what exactly is the bmw x2 this is bmw's version basically of the countryman even though the countryman was basically built by bmw so it's kind of an interesting scenario i think this is the car that was created because there were bmw customers that liked the countryman but didn't want to drive a mini and i've encountered this before that there are bmw people out there who despise minis for some strange reason so they had to create this car to cater to those who liked driving the countrymen but didn't want to drive the countrymen so they created the x2 it's a very nice vehicle it's definitely not as boring as the x1 is but is it as fun to drive as the mini countryman yes and no styling is a little bit different the drive feels about the same although the steering doesn't quite feel as precise as the countryman does which is really strange this has more horsepower you can also get a lot of horsepower in the countryman if you go for the john cooper works variant which is basically the same as the x2 m35i i think the mini is still far more fun to drive but i'm gonna have to say this it's pretty darn close between the two cars i mean the x2 definitely feels about the same as a mini countryman aside from a few details and the countryman feels very much like the x2 in a way as far as how it drives the styling is obviously different the engines are the same the drivetrains are the same it's basically the same car but in a way it's not and i feel like there's something special about the x2 i think that if many had wanted to they could take the x2 styling make it more mini cooper and you would have the mini paceman this could basically be a mini paceman if you made it a two door and kept this low slung roof so in conclusion here i have this mini countryman and i have this x2 around me what did i think of the x2 when compared to the countryman well great car overall very nice very very nice it's still very fun to drive however my money is still on the countryman because i still think the countryman's a better vehicle i still think it's more fun to drive and i just can't wrap my head around the fact that they put four badges on a bmw and the fact that the head room in the back is so cramped effectively they are siblings or maybe cousins we could go either way which one would you pick if you had to pick between these two cars i'm asking you this because my opinion is obvious that i'd go with the mini and that's a very biased opinion but there are those of you out there who would go with the x2 i hope you enjoyed this video if you did leave a like below don't forget to comment subscribe to the channel if you haven't already done so and as always before i let you go i'm just gonna remind you that life is too short to drive a boring car so well you know exactly what i'm gonna say drive a mini absolutely drive a mini i'll see you on the next video [Music] you
15;Mini;2021 Mini Countryman;Mini Clubman vs Countryman - Which is the best ?! [Buyers Guide];hey guys and welcome to petrol ped now imagine you're in the market for a small to medium-sized family car maybe you've had a mini in the past and you're after that go-kart feel but you need a little bit more practicality so the obvious question is mini clubman or maybe mini countryman now behind me is my 2019 mini clubman jcw and thanks to mini uk i've got the latest 2021 countryman jcw so i thought it would be really interesting to compare and contrast these two cars in a number of very important criteria okay first up let's consider looks and size and i know this bit's very subjective [Music] now i know styling is very subjective and we all have our preferences so i'll keep this bit reasonably short i really like what they've done on this facelift of the countrymen they've improved it in lots and lots of areas and i think this car looks an awful lot better than the outgoing model obvious difference is there's no bonnet scoop on the countryman where it there is one on the clubman even though that's a fake unless you open it up like i've done on mine wheels-wise many of you will know i've changed the wheels on this car to ozed racing wheels but originally it had the same wheels that the countryman is running and i really like those lovely diamond cut wheels they look really really smart and then the only thing i'd probably change on this from a styling point of view as you can tell i'm a big stripes fan so i put some red bonnet stripes and maybe side stripes and i think this car would look absolutely perfect for me but the most important comparison i think between these two is going to be size and weight and my initial thoughts would be this is going to be a significantly bigger car it certainly looks bigger but it's not actually that much bigger both cars are about 4.3 meters long and about 1.8 meters wide but the countryman is only 33 millimeters longer and 22 millimeters wider so it's actually not the footprint of the car isn't that much bigger the difference however is height you can probably see it from there but this car is 116 millimeters higher than the clubman so that's going to raise the center of gravity and certainly affect things like the handling when we're out on the road and then finally both cars are in the region of 1600 kilos this is 1625 kilos and 1675 kilos so only 50 kilos difference between the two and i found that really interesting so the rest of it the styling you guys make your own mind up which one you prefer but from a size point of view actually there isn't a great deal in it just checking to see if i can fit some flaps now there's a very good chance you're going to want someone sat in the back of one of these so what's the rear passenger leg room and general comfort like you know what it's not bad there's not masses of room in here but i am a very tall six foot three with a 34 inch inside leg so i've got very long legs and this seat is as far back as it's meant to go so leg room is is okay could be better however what is really good in here is lots and lots of headroom this higher raised ceiling height or raised roof line just gives a bigger more airy feeling here not bad so i wonder how that compares to the clubman all right oh hold on a minute this isn't happening no i'm not getting in there and this seat is in my driver's position so exactly the same position my legs haven't shrunk or grown or anything it's the same it's very very limited i wonder if i could hold on maybe if i put my leg in differently to start with it there all splits out no that's not happening so i think it's safe to say the countryman wins that one by a countryman mile now then family car means practical and carrying stuff around boot space the all-important boot space what's the difference [Music] now firstly when we're talking boot space there's a very big difference between these two cars one has a traditional tailgate and the clubman has the barn doors now you either love them or hate them we'll get to that in a minute let's talk about the countryman first aha an eager volunteer yes we need to talk about dogs first of all now before anybody asks darcy is inside she's been to the vet this morning she's feeling very sorry for herself nothing too majorly serious but she's certainly not feeling the love for the camera right now but you always are aren't you mate so yeah perfect amounts of room for the dogs it is a slightly raised car so it's maybe a little bit more difficult getting stuff in and out but the big question is can you fit a bike in the boot without taking the wheel off what do you reckon dude you wanna get a bike so i need a bike bear with me pass the shelf out and a little bit of fast music still got my turbo tire on apologies for that it's coming off this weekend now then can we no not quite long enough however if i took the front wheel off that would be okay for me i would also probably struggle the saddle is a little bit tall so it's not quite big enough to get a bike of my size in but that's fine because i put bikes either on the roof or for 200 quid you can get bike prep at the back of this car to allow you to put a tow bar mounted uh rack on for normal bikes or you could get one that's suitable for an e-bike so not quite big enough this doesn't bode well for the clubman but we'll give it a go anyway right let's just put this on the ground here or up against this wall let's go and have a look at the club now then i'll tell you straight away that the size of this boot is clearly much smaller than the countryman but the aperture is also smaller so getting big stuff in and out you're going to struggle a little bit more you can drop the seats now a couple of interesting things we've actually got a boot liner in the car because we carry the dogs in the back and that's one of the reasons i love this car so much is it's just so easy when you've got a couple of dogs if we're going to the beach we stick them in the back we've got the ball wanger in here and it just means it doesn't ming up the boot you can take the liner out or hoover it's it's just so easy to keep clean if you have bigger dogs you might want to fit a dog cage or you know a dog guard so it is much much more practical than a standard mini but not nearly as practical as the countryman and i'm not going to try and get my bike in the back because i tell you for now i have to take both wheels off and it's a real tight squeeze so when i'm transporting my bike in this i use a roof mounted bike carrier now one of the things that you probably need to make sure you either spec or look for if you're going to buy one of these are the roof rails you can't retro fit the roof rails so if you're thinking about carrying a roof mounted bike rack or a roof box you've got to make sure you spec the roof rails there is no difference in width between these two cars in roof rails so in terms of what you can put on the roof so my roof box is quite wide so i can either carry a roof box or i can carry two bikes if you had a narrower roof box you might be able to carry kind of on half you could carry the roof box and on the other half you could carry a bike so if we're going away for i know one or two weeks normally we'll put the roof box on the roof and that just gives us that extra amount of stowage space so for everyday use plenty of room if you want to go away for a longer trip or if you've got kids in the back and a family you might find that this even the clubman being a little bit more practical isn't quite practical enough and you might need to then go and have a roof box on but they're super easy to fit the mini roof bars look really smart and then you can fit any kind of accessories onto the top of those next up for the driver anyway the really important bit driving position and general driver creature comforts yes a very familiar place i love the driving position of this car but in comparison to the countryman the most important thing probably to state is the fact that you sit much lower down in the car and you kind of that envelops you into the car and for me it gives you a far more engaging driving experience now i've got the 2019 model so i've got the analog clocks in front of me and i if you watch my countryman review already i really don't like the new electronic display i would much rather have the analog clocks however what i do like in the countrymen is the way that they've upgraded the central nav screen so when you're using apple carplay it's now full screen instead of two thirds screen which totally does my heading everything else in here very very similar it's just a little bit you you sat in lower you feel a bit more enveloped in the car and for me that makes you more engaged in the drive but let's head on over to the countryman and have a look at that now then instantly sat higher up no great surprise there but the roof line or roof height is higher but the just general cabin position is much higher up the road you have a much more elevated driving position which i know many people like what that does do though is it just disengages you from the car a little bit you feel sat on it rather than in it everything else in here mentioned the tft screen in front of me don't like that but i do like the swoop of the dash um it just has a i know a very different feel but i like it a lot and i like the red accents and the kind of piano black work it's a really nice cabin now in terms of driver room clearly we've talked about the clubman having slightly less room for a passenger in the back but in terms of driving there is plenty of room for the driver i've got actually probably a little bit of travel left in the seat if i wanted to go back a little bit further there's plenty of adjustment to the steering wheel you can kind of move it up and down and in and out so you can get a nice driving position but yeah not bad for me though i'd have the clubman driving position just because you feel sat far far more into the car and it just for me makes the driving experience that little bit better now then it's time to take these two cars out on the road so the first thing i want to consider is ride quality [Music] now i must say the ride quality in this countryman is excellent grown up and mature is how i described it in my review but i think that is the best way to describe it it's actually quite unmini-like minis have a tendency to be quite firm in the suspension especially the jcw variants and this car really isn't like that actually it's a pleasure on a b road even when the road surface isn't all that good now in terms of ride quality my car is hampered a little bit because of the upgrade i did to wheels and tires so the countryman was running on 19-inch rims but two two five forty-five profile tyres i'm still running 19-inch rims on this but the clubman has two four five thirty profile tires much much smaller profile and what that means is a much much firmer ride um and it's been quite a while since i've driven a clubman that isn't mine that has normal tyres but from what i remember the ride did feel a little bit more firm than the countryman so ride quality wise i'd probably give it to the countryman now then i've got the two sporty versions of the clubman and countryman behind me the jcw it's a very important question is what's the noise like now i am cheating a little bit here with my car because i have a remus race exhaust on my car which does sound really good but it will be very interesting to compare a stock jcw exhaust on the countryman with a remus race exhaust on the clubman [Music] now what about noise well when you used to buy a jcw back in the day they were known for uh burbles and pops and crackles on overrun i remember when i bought my little roadster it popped a lot don't expect it when you buy one of these so this countryman's just running the standard jcw exhaust and honestly i haven't heard a pop or a splutter or anything like that since i've had it in fact even at startup it sounds like this once you're on the road however if i just drop it into sport box and accelerate away a little bit that piped in noise sounds just like my car but it really doesn't deliver the auditory drama and pleasure that i'd like but that's just the world we live in today manufacturers just cannot make cars sound as good as they used to now noise wise i'm sorry but there's no comparison and i am i guess playing unfair it's like taking a machine gun to a knife fight this remus exhaust really does sound nice when the car starts and it's stationary rev it sounds like this [Music] so yeah loads more burbles and popples and cracks now you don't get so many of those when you're driving if you come into a corner and you change down from maybe third to second you will get some pops on overrun but not as bad as something like my roadster which is frankly ridiculous so if you want that extra engagement you'd get from the noise then for me getting an opf back exhaust upgrade is something well worth doing because you're just not going to get that from a stock exhaust as i've mentioned already these are the performance variants of both cars same engine same drivetrain 306 horsepower 450 newton meters of torque whopping great big brembo brakes on the front so it would be rude not to do a naught to 60 and back down to north test side by side [Music] [Music] three [Music] and finally for me these two cars are all about driving enjoyment and driving engagement so let's find a decent bit of b road and give them both a good spanking [Music] driving enjoyment there's only one place gear stick to the left manual gear change petrol pedal climb [Music] oh complete hero going up the hill i'm gonna have to slow down for him oh man now let's resume shall we [Music] see now it really shouldn't be able to do that it's actually pretty competent in the corners it's got a bit of body roll but so much traction and the gearbox and the drivetrain just feel so familiar to me so similar to the clubman but it's got the go and the pool to overcome that extra 50 kilos actually in the corners it's a really really exciting really engaging car to drive and even the higher driving position doesn't really give you too much of a penalty and it still has the mini go-kart feel and i really don't understand how the steering's nice and it's not quite as twitchy and quite as direct as some of the minis but it's not bad not bad for a car of this size and this weight driving enjoyment in the countryman is pretty good now i've driven up this hill many many times in my car so i know what's about to happen i still love doing it into second and then give it some beans now there's a couple of things working in favor of this car a lower center of gravity 50 kilos less weight lower profile tires better tires i'm running michelin pilot sport 4s tires perhaps the best tires there are instead of the p0s that are on the countryman [Music] and this car's just well it's just brilliant oh god i love my car so yes um it's it's probably an obvious thing to state but the clubman performs better on a road like that than the countryman and to me in terms of driving enjoyment it therefore delivers a higher level of driving enjoyment it doesn't mean to say however that it's not fun driving the countrymen but the clubman it's lighter it's lower and it just drives better i'm afraid to say so if pure driving enjoyment is your deciding factor there's only one choice it's got to be the club so there you go hopefully you found that an interesting comparison road test side by side to be honest i love both of these cars my clubman is perhaps the best car i've ever owned i love her to bits in every way brilliant performance really good practicality and i like the looks as well and i know it's not a mini it's quite a big car but i really do love the clubman so when the countryman came along and it is a significantly bigger car and a different segment as well but so many of the underpinnings are the same i knew that the performance the straight line performance anyway is going to be very very similar you'd spot the difference on a stopwatch but when you're driving the car they're very very similar it's very difficult to feel the difference in speed between the two but what i wasn't expecting with the countryman was that just the dynamics of the driving experience it belies its size it's super nimble it goes through the corners really well it doesn't wallow and roll like you think it would and actually it delivers that that that mini go-kart like feel driving experience however it's got that extra bit of practicality a little bit more passenger room a bigger boot the ability to carry more stuff and that makes it for me a really interesting proposition if you just have that little you know bigger family a couple of kids more stuff to carry around if i was buying one and i had a choice between the two i'll be honest with you i'd still take the clubman every time however the countryman really really interesting anyway i hope you enjoyed that one i'd love to know which one you choose put it in the comments below but if you enjoyed that one please give me a thumbs up comments below are always welcome and if you haven't done so already please subscribe to petroped for plenty more content to come i want to say a massive thank you to minnie uk for letting me play with the countryman for the last week it's been a really great experience i'm so glad i finally got one on the channel but that's it for me i hope you enjoyed it i'll see on the next film you take care drive safe foreign
16;Mini;2021 Mini Countryman;2021 Mini Cooper Countryman S All4, better than Audi Q3? Review and comparison.;[Music] this behind me is the 2021 mini cooper countryman all 4 s and today i'm going to review it for you show you everything you need to know about it and how does it compare against the competitors such as the audi q3 the bmw x1 as well which is technically engineers under the bmw umbrella today we're going to talk about what does it offer we're going to take it for a test drive i'm going to talk about how this thing handles on the road and what kind of tech features and if it's actually worth over the competitors the mini cooper is quite a quirky vehicle it offers quite a lot of interesting features and it has its own unique design especially on the outside and it follows the same thing on the interior the beautiful thing is that you got a couple of options to choose from in terms of trims and engines there are two engines you have a three cylinder and a four cylinder there are four country man models to choose from starting with the base which it is a turbo three cylinder cooper all four that starts the 32 000 canadian moving up to the turbo 4s and topping out with the plug-in hybrid sc all4 which it is at 44 000 doors you also have the high performance jcw all four at 43 000. the model we have for today's video with the premiere plus package it is more than forty seven thousand dollars and that is of course in canadian you have three trims to choose from you have the classic which starts at twenty one hundred dollars canadian you have the premiere at forty seven hundred dollars and the premiere plus which is the one we have today's video at 7 300 canadian some of the features of the classics like the led headlights a panoramic sunroof keyless ignition and heated front seats the premiere adds power adjustable front seats you get dual zone automatic climate control gps and a navigation a power liftgate apple carplay and more you also get a premium audio system with a premiere plus and a heads-up display and of course the navigation system with the real-time traffic information and an eight-point inch collar touchscreen with a full digital instrument cluster this model that you see in here of course has a bit more performance looking not the same as the jcw the hood it's sort of more performance driven you have the center area the front area the same thing with the grill and the bottom part as well so overall this is actually quite a good looking vehicle i'll say it all comes down to taste of course and everyone has a different opinion about it but i think this package it's actually quite interesting the way they've put them together from the actual grill the side profile and so on now how does it compare to the bmw x1 and the audi q3 the q3 technically looks smaller than this it actually looks more like a sportback the x1 feels almost the same in terms of the size the difference is that in here this has more of a boxy style and a bit of a curved area in the front but i do like the overall exterior it makes it feel unique and very different from let's say the bmw or the audi q3 this is much more different than any vehicle out there on the road and that's what i love about the mini cooper now let's talk about the rear end first of all that signature design on the front continues all the way to the back with the special tail light union jack style tail lights and you have the countryman blacked out badge at the back a very unique design to this and with this package you get a single exhaust on each side that gives you that rumble noise which i like it especially when you put in sport mode you get a bit more of that it makes it more interesting tech features what do we have led tail lights most importantly you do get a backup camera as well and with your key fob in your pocket this little cute key fob that i absolutely love you can slide your foot under and bang on it would open the tailgate so you have a hands-free tailgate option with this premiere plus and of course through the key fob and most importantly you have the buttons over here the first thing you recognize with this these buttons the fact that they're technically bmw buttons and very familiar now let's talk about underneath you got more space under here most importantly you can add more stuff so you got quite a lot of cargo room for the size of this vehicle in terms of the cargo space you get about 17.6 cubic feet of space in total with the plug-in hybrids you don't get the same amount if you fold the second row seeds it stretches all the way to 47.6 cubic feet of space and most importantly you have this cover here which you can open it and then put more stuff underneath so it's not better than the average just below the average on its own segment okay into the second row first of all i'm six two so i'm average i'm taller than the average individual which means i should feel uncomfortable here and i don't because it actually is comfortable inside very spacious i have quite a lot of head room leg room is still comfortable the seat in the front is positioned away as if i was the driver so that way we make a fair uh comparison to other models now compared to the q3 which i have reviewed this does feel more spacious inside and most importantly had room and in terms of visibility in the front too in terms of tech features we only got two usbc ports at the bottom vents but we have no heated seats in the back but you do get a full panoramic roof now it is split in half so you get the one in the back which you can close it manually with the actual filter and then we have one in the front the same thing it's split in half so it's actually not full panoramic roof but both sides get a bit of a sunlight from here you can't open the back one but you can open the front sunroof it's nice and comfortable inside beautiful leather interior i love this headrest they have that signature mini cooper this is what i love about the mini cooper it's it's different than any other vehicle that you review in most vehicles you get in you get to see the same kind of steering wheel maybe the infrastructure display is a bit different but this is like completely different from anything you'd see out there and it all comes down to whether you like it or not because the design overall whether it's inside or outside it's slightly different compared to an average subcompact suv okay let's talk about the mini cooper first of all the interior it is quite interesting how different this thing is inside compared to any standard vehicle for that matter so i've reviewed q3s i've reviewed the bmw x1 they're very different but also similar at the same time the mini cooper has a complete different design from all of them and that's what i love about this so let's start first with the actual the heads-up display it's like a fighter jet style i love that because it just pops out it's hidden inside the actual instrument cluster in here the digital cluster it is attached to the steering column so every time you move the steering column it actually moves with the cluster as well very different the actual infotainment display here is of course touch screen you have a backup camera as well you have apple car play but you don't get any android auto from the document that i was given this packed out this is the premiere plus which technology is the higher trim it is not available with this package you only have one usb port the other problem as well the actual center console has the armrest underneath has the wireless charging pad my phone is apple a iphone 12 pro max it can't fit in there it's too big even with the case out taken off it's still too big for the phone the actual case itself it's not big enough and that is the problem now the next thing that i find interesting with this vehicle is the area here you see it's like the signature of mini cooper the circle here it changes light uh it changes the light itself based on different color it also changes based on the driving modes as well which is very unique to the mini cooper for this specific area like i understand most vehicles have interior lighting this has a uniqueness in there the whole design inside in my opinion is so different from any vehicle out there it's it's unique to the mini cooper some things that i like about this the sitting position it's nice some things that i don't like about it the space for the driver in the front someone that is six to i don't feel as comfortable here do i feel as comfortable in the q3 not really so it's not bad in terms of space here leg room it is spacious as a driver you get to enjoy a lot of the space inside here but it someone that is 6-2 the lag room it's not the best and if i move further back the passenger in the back won't have more space unless it is someone that is shorter than i in terms of the steering here i love this area i love the steering wheel everything is right in front of me they're not too far you have the heads-up display the cluster right in the center i can see clearly they have made the cluster big enough so you can see that it doesn't bother the steering wheel because you have this center area the points at the top for grip they don't impede the visibility off the digital cluster the actual sunroof you can open in the front it has a sunshade as well and most importantly you can open the sunroof completely let's talk about the noise inside how quiet does it feel is it quieter than the audi a3 is it quite on the audi q3 and the bmw x1 um now really i do hear a bit of the wind noise in here and i do hear the cars passing by but if you are two people inside you can have a decent conversation or have to raise your voice um it's still very very well isolated i would say it's not the best in the market but it's definitely isolated inside and you can have a decent conversation with the passenger even if you have two people in the back visibility that's the next question it's pretty wide in the back and the third window as well you have a third window which is massive gives you great visibility of the door on my right side same way with this package this doesn't offer any blind spot assist that's something that it's weird like every car has it i'm not sure why they didn't offer with the premium plus it could be potentially maybe offered as an extra charge that could be the reason because i don't see any blind spot assist in this area and no 360 camera with the premier plus for that price it's a bit expensive i must say it's a very um it's a bit expensive compared to the audi q3 which could offer a little bit more than that and on top of that we don't even get ventilated seats in here so that's the disappointing part with this vehicle now let's talk about the power delivery let's put in sport mode [Music] you have two options when it comes to driving modes you have the sports and the green the power delivery it's nice but it's not the most exciting out there i think if you want some power you want to go with the jcw that could make the experience definitely far better in terms of driver assistant package we have gap assist you have cruise control advanced cruise control as well um we also have lean assist with this package and as you can see from the button here we have the pedestrian warning front uh frontal collision warning as well there's some safety features let's turn on the cruise control it's not actively steering for you to keep you within the lanes but it's making sure that you don't bounce left and right when you turn the signal it switches of course off so that way you're able to move into the middle lane or the lane that you want to merge overall the mini cooper is is great but i feel a bit pricey but then you have the fans that love a vehicle like this that is different from any other sub compact suvs i think it's a great vehicle for the what it offers but i the price is something that i'm not 100 convinced with this car overall it looks nice it has a bit of a power you can enjoy the driving in here you can drive the driving experience but i think overall just a bit pricey other than that the vehicle is still still where it should be in terms of competition and it comes down to taste in my opinion whether you like this kind of design or not i'm i'm a big fan of this vehicle i love the the smaller version i don't like the countryman as much but i love the mini cooper the standard mini cooper it's a fun vehicle to drive and a lot of fun this is the same but if that was me i would definitely go for the jcw because i love a bit of power and love a bit of that performance looking style for the vehicle overall this it's still well capable great on the road comfortable ride suspension system changes a bit from eco mode green mode to sport mode uh it's not as stiff it is comfortable overall it doesn't have a boat ride but it it's still very enjoyable overall overall i think the vehicle it's a good choice but i think it just slightly overpriced compared to other vehicles like the q3 and the x1 even the volvo for that matter stay safe cheers
17;Mini;2021 Mini Countryman;MINI Cooper S 2021 review - better than a VW Polo GTI?;this is the mini five-door look it's got rear door more practical version of the normal mini hatchback and mini has made some changes to this car recently so they've tweaked the look slightly they've rated the suspension a bit they've done some changes to the engine i'm going to talk you through all the changes and upgrades and tell you what this car is like to drive and to live with in this video i'm matt watson and you're watching car wow buying a new car then head to car wow and my team will help you find your next car at a fair price car wow your one stop car buying comparison site let's start this video by talking about the price so the mini five door starts from just over 17 000 pounds so you can save an average of just over 2 000 pounds of one through car wow now if you want to see how much money you can have a new car click on the pop out button up there just popping out the top right hand corner of the screen you can go directly to car wow alternatively after this video you can just simply google help me car wow my team and i help you choose the right car for you and get it for a fair price from one of our trusted dealers right let's talk about the design because that's what the mini is all about it's a very designed some might say over designed car it's got a new rear bumper design compared to the previous version that's what they're going to look like this is the cooper s so it means it's got performance engine in it but you can also get an even higher performance car the john cooper works and two lower power versions the cooper and then the slowest version which is the one but then you can make them look different depending on if you have the classic trim the sport trim or the exclusive trim this is the sport trim and so you get this diffuser which is fake as are these vents here what i do like is the rear fog light it's a little led strip used to be round lights and the sunlight feature this car very recognizable union jack style tail lamps and a sporty roof spoiler which looks a little bit over designed as well here at the side the five-door version of the mini just doesn't look quite as cool as the three-door it's just a bit elongated to make space for these rear doors a bit more rear passenger space we'll get to that in a moment now some of the changes they made here at the side slightly different real arch cladding did you spot that you probably didn't they've also changed the alloy world designs as well this has the john cooper works 18 inch alloys though as standard the car starts off with 16 inches those look like they'd be very easy to curb it's a distinctive car from the side and this is quite distinctive as well this piece of plastic this stuck on there i'm not just sure about that here at the front the car's got a redesigned grille there's quite a lot going on here vents there that are real then some that aren't and that one definitely isn't now i used to have a mark one new bmw mini if that makes sense which had a supercharger on it and that vent actually fed air into the engine bay not now in fact the whole car's grown in size and i used to love the look of the mini but i'm liking it less and less but what do you think let me know in the comments below what you think of the styling of this mini i think it's definitely a love it or loathe it kind of car now i think the exterior design of the mini has got worse as it's moved through the generations i think the interior design has improved i really do like the interior it's quirky it's very well made feels solid you would not mistake this car for anything else this big central screen here which incidentally they've updated the screen made it bigger they've improved the infotainment system as well so it's just easier to navigate and use and it's all very very simple you can get a digital driver's display as well the steering wheel feels nice though it is rather fat comparing my hands around it but it's got good quality feel to it the driving position is pretty nice there's lots of adjustment in the steering wheel i also like the fact you can get the seat quite low in this car which helps with the sporty feel now if you're tall you might find headroom a little bit tight but if you're short you'll be thankful that you can jack the seat up quite a long way so you can sort of get a view out over that bonnet in terms of practicality i'll just look at this here with me the glove box is actually a good size you've got a couple of cupholders there but then if you have a normal sized bottle it's fine however you have a bigger bottle well it'll fit in there then you get in the way of your buttons then that's where your stop start button is in your sport mode button down there and you're going to want to put a bigger bottle in there because there's no way that's fitting the door bin this is not as practical as something like a volkswagen polo and if you'd like to see my four independent review of a volkswagen polo if you click on the pop-up banner up there you can watch that video i'll tell you what though i do like these sports seats which come as part of the sports pack they hold you firmly in place quite a lot of the design as well now the main reason you're buying the five-door version of the mini rather than the three-door is because it's more practical because you've got these rear doors however as small cars with rear doors go it's one of the least practical for instance these doors don't open all that it's difficult to get if you're an adult kids will be fine once you're back here knee room isn't too bad actually look the car in the seat does help foot space is a little bit cramped headroom's tight i'm sitting up straight and i've got about that much room so liveable if you're over six foot you will just about be able to coat back here technically you could carry three people in the back there's a third seat belt but there is this big thing in the center it's actually a cup holder you can easily fit that but i think everyone has to fight over this cupholder maybe you just fill it with water or something just fill it with water there we go and then people can dip a straw in and drink out of that anyway let's continue so if you have to carry through in the back at once this is no fun at all it's tantamount to torture really i've got that at my bottom and about that much space to sit my buttocks on look at that i've got a small bottom and even i don't fit on there oh dear another thing that's a bit awkward let's fit in a chance in the back of here because they haven't got that much room to maneuver it's hard to get the seat in thankfully though there are easy access ice fix anchor points and you've got lift up covers so you're not going to lose those so it's not all bad news another benefit of the five-door version of the mini over the three-door is that it has a slightly bigger boot bigger by 67 litres so now you have 278 liters of space which is still a little bit on the small side for instance a peugeot 208 boot capacity is 311 liters and if you want to see my full in-depth video review of that car click on the pop-up button up there you can go check out that video however this boot does have quite a lot of functionality for instance check this out right you've got a false floor and you can like store things under there if you want or if you need to carry taller items in the boot you can just prop that bit up like that and then have suitcases piled up suitcases one or two maybe hold up here in the boot and then when you fold the seats down you might be thinking oh my god look there's a big ridge what happens if you want to slide something heavy to the front it's going to be annoying well you can't actually lift this up i'm going to demonstrate it now with perfect ease come on come on look at that almost seamlessly but there you go look then you have a continuous floor and you can just slide things out of the back of the car quite easily as well you've got some tie down hooks there and there's a 12 volt socket but there's something i've noticed it's a bit frustrating and that's the fact that this bumper does protrude quite away so you end up leaning on it and if it's dirty like this it seems to catch the dirt the design of it you end up with very dirty trousers that brings on to five or nine things about this mini depending on where the sun is you can get terrible glare off these dars so you can hardly read them and look at this look as part of the navigation plus pack you get wireless charging the only problem is that it doesn't fit larger phones such as my galaxy s20 ultra and if your phone does fit as soon as it's enclosed and while it's charging it can then overheat and switch off media's fitted this car with a petrol particulate filter as part of the update the only problem is is that on this cooper s version which is supposed to be sporty it's reduced the power by 13 horsepower compared to the previous version this armrest gets in the way of the manual handbrake so when you put it on you know you have to fold this out of the way and yeah there we go got the brake on now and then when i want to leave i have to pull that down and then fold that down like that there we go that's annoying as well this dual sunroof is a 700 pound option annoyingly though it's manually operated no problem here in the front but if you want to stop some glare coming in from the back it's hard to do that when you're driving thankfully this car has plenty of cool features to help make up for all this here's five you get the car with interior ambient lighting and if you want to switch to colors you don't have to mess around by going through menus in the infotainment system in the button there you just press it and you can cycle through all the different colors it does sport models of this car come with a new type of damper when you hit a sudden jolt the damper opens up a valve to let it move more freely so you don't get that shot going through to the cabin like you would have done on a standard damper now you can get that system as an option on other trim versions of the mini there are various wired charging options depending on how old you are which is kind of important considering mini it's quite a wide range of customer for instance for the old vogue is there's a 12 volt socket there for mid laser you've got the normal usb for the youngsters there's usbc and like with some other manufacturers the car gets a contrasting roof as standard though if you'd rather have it the same as the rest of the body you can do optionally you can now get the car with a tri-color roof and the way it's sprayed means that each one is completely unique check it out look we've got our car play without having to connect a wire if only there's android auto then it'd be perfect it's not there now let's talk about the engines so it's quite simple there's three to choose from so there's the mini one it has a three cylinder 1.5 litre turbo petrol with 102 horsepower then there's the cooper which has the same engine but it's tuned up to 136 horsepower then there's this cooper s version which has a two liter four-cylinder turbo petrol with 178 horsepower all cars are front-wheel drive but you can have a choice of either a manual or an automatic gearbox now let's see what this mini is like to drive starting off with what it's like in town because it's relatively small it's quite decent for nipping through gaps in traffic and the responsive steering means that you can change direction pretty quickly what's not so good though is this big blind spot you get here in fact the view out is limited compared to other smaller cars it's just the way that the windscreen is quite shallow and the back window isn't the largest it's all to do with the character of the car you sit quite low in it and that means that you see quite a lot of dash in front of you rather than road it's not a problem though what can be is a suspension the changes made to the suspension have made it a bit better than it was before but you still do feel the bumps way more than you're doing something like an audi a1 in fact if you want to see my fort index video review of that car put a link popping down the top right corner of the screen click on that you can watch that video if you want to it's not terrible though and it is slightly improved after they've made the recent changes to the car one thing you might want to think about though is the wheel size because the smaller wheels you have the better the comfort will be the only problem is smaller wheels don't look as good and the reason you bought a mini is for the looks right it's the whole reason to have this car it's the quirky styling another reason to have the car is driver enjoyment in that respect i will go for the manual gearbox because it is very nice to use this is the automatic and actually to live with every day it is easier especially for when you're just mooching around in town or in traffic because you don't have to faff around with a clutch or changing gears however what's this car like when you get out onto the open road well what i'm going to do is show how well this gearbox kicks down when you're driving a long in sports mode and you floor it it's a little bit slow but then it's off and here we go 70 miles an hour so this two liter engine it picks up all right it makes a bit of a noise when you're revving it out listen not sure that's a good noise like it's not enjoying it so much and it doesn't really rev out hard at the end of the rev range either it's all a bit lethargic at the top end a bit of a shame really because that's the whole point of having the keeper is the performance anyway i'll come back to the performance in a moment because i will launch this car to see how quick it is for not 60 miles an hour but what i want to tell you about is the main problem with this car for longer journeys and it's the noise you get from the tyres this car is so noisy when you're cruising along at 70 miles an hour once again the bigger the wheels the more noise you get however none of this matters does it because you've bought a mini for that go-kart handling for the fun factor and it does have a dirty feel to it once it sets up in the corner this guy doesn't leave much at all in the benz it stays nice and flat but it's just not quite as much fun as you think it might be in fact if you want a fun handling small car get a ford fiesta handle's better than this i don't think this car is particularly bad at handling it's more that it's getting on a bit now and other cars just do a better job of it i think this is more of a car that you buy for its looks rather than how it drives it's all about the show less about the go speaking of which let's launch this car so it does not 6d mini says his keeper s version should do naught to 60 in 6.8 seconds for the automatic gearbox 6.9 for the manual to launch here you have to have the stability control in sports mode the gearbox in sport therefore on the brake floor the throttle launch control active it's holding the res at one and a half thousand rpm i don't know this is gonna be good anyway let's go oh did our eye on the traction there what's the naught to 60 what are we gonna get two six click in the middle says am i brave enough to do the standing quarter mile come on clock it up running out of road running that road i'm gonna have to break now got it 14.71 oh my god i don't know if you saw that seven one oh my god when i was breaking this car was just all over the place just moving around wasn't stable on the brakes at all it was quite frightening oh dear idea maybe that's how he does have go-kart handling because that's what little go-karts do [Music] so then what's my final verdict on the mini five-door should you avoid it should you consider it should you shortlist it or should you just go right ahead and buy it well i reckon you should consider the mini five-door it's the kind of car that you're either gonna like the look of or not and either gonna wanna buy it or not and it's quirky it's just that it's also very compromised hey if you enjoyed the video please give it a like also let me know if any other videos you'd like

18;Mini;2023 Mini Cooper SE;Mini Cooper Electric 2023 review: Is fun and funky enough for you to choose this EV? 4K;this mini is an electric mini but it's much more than that i think it's one of the most underrated electric cars on sale in australia now and i think that because it takes on challenges that other electric cars don't it doesn't brag about its range it doesn't brag about its sustainability or how many recycled materials it uses this car focuses on driving and that makes it quite unique in the ev world now you can read our full written review over at carsguy.com dot a u and it's on our ev guide site section where we answer all of your ev questions that you might have so let's get into it first things first pricings and specs now it's impossible to talk about pricing and specs for electric cars without also talking about range and well on that front the mini is not exactly good value you see it'll only travel just over 200 kilometers on a single charge which isn't great by any measure but many would argue that's not the point and i'm actually inclined to agree with them let's look at why wearing a before on-roads price tag which starts in the region of 55 000 and tops out at well over 60k for the limited resolute edition we're driving for this video the cooper se is competing on price with cars like the base tesla model 3 pulsed r2 and even the nissan leaf all of which have significantly more range for the same money even combustion hot hatches are significantly cheaper in this price range while its driving range is very limited for what you're paying it's worth remembering that minis are generally in the realm of premium pricing anyway and will attract a customer seeking a niche experience the equipment list is relatively healthy for a mini with the electric version being based off the high spec s trim from the combustion range you'll get standard equipment like synthetic leather seat trim an 8.8 inch multimedia touchscreen with wireless apple carplay connectivity as well as built-in sat-nav and a wireless phone charger a 5.5 inch semi-digital instrument cluster led headlights 17-inch alloy wheels and dual zone climate which feels a little overkill for such a small cabin of course a key part of the mini experience is customization and this is more what its range of variants allow all share the same motor range and battery specs but the base classic variant makes do with more limited trim choices while the more expensive mid-grade yours and limited edition resolute which we tested for this review allow a more diverse set of color and interior trim options now what can we say about design when it comes to minis it's not as though the brand has revolutionized things year on year although the one we have here is in a special edition resolute trim which means you get the signature green color and the white roof which i love because every other brand does contrast roofs in black let's take a closer look i will say though the mini is aging well at least on the outside it's almost timeless and classic looks betray its age and it's been brought up to date with a few tweaks here and there particularly in those led headlight clusters and more contemporary wheel choices now you might have seen mini electrics with the kind of like three prong plug design wheels and yeah they're kind of fun and over the top electric-y but i kind of like it when the cooper sticks to the formula and these are my favorite wheels that the car comes with these are called the tentacle wheel and they've got the little accents in there to remind you that it is the electric version which i love inside is less of a good story while there's certainly an element of this car hiding its age with the caricatured style it's easy to tell from its dated multimedia offering and somewhat simple digital dash that it's not the latest offering on the market there are a few bits of older bmw switch gear in the interior too from the touch based indicators to the shift stick but it's still a funky space to be in which ultimately is the goal interestingly and even from the outside there is next to nothing to indicate the cooper is electric which i actually think helps it rather than hinters it as customers aren't faced with having to stick with a particular aesthetic as they might have to be with versions of the hyundai kona or mgzs which are electric alright practicality does anybody buy a mini for practicality i really hope not because well just have a look at the boot i don't have our signature cars guide luggage set but you can probably see straight away there that there's just not much boot to work with so what's it like in the cabin well if you've never driven a mini before i'll show you okay up front it's kooky because it's a mini there's just a lot going on there's a massive center dial thing which will be familiar if you've been in any mini before but currently it houses a multimedia screen and it's got kind of clunky old bmw software which isn't the best to use it's still a touch screen but you can operate it with a little center dial as well so there are kind of multiple ways you can go about that i like the steering wheel and i like the funky little digital dash fitting in here which both has a digital piece to it but also it has like an actual analog dial that shows you how much energy you're putting down and your regen as well it's kind of quaint i like it if you're any taller than me it's going to feel a bit squashed in here too so it's worth keeping that in mind and these seats while they look really cool they're manual adjust which is a bit of a tall order for a car that costs this much money okay this doesn't look good i know what you're thinking and to be honest with you it wasn't graceful to get in here either but actually i'm impressed that i fit it all because minnie said one of the things that they changed when they made this car electric was that actually raised this rear bench up a little bit to facilitate batteries underneath so the fact that my head isn't touching the roof and the fact that if i slot my feet in i can actually sit behind my own driving position it's not as bad as you think it's going to be to sum up them this little car is mini by name and many by nature preferring to stick to its stylistic roots then try and change things to make it bigger on the inside no matter which trim level you pick the mini electric is powered by a single 135 kilowatt 270 newton meter electric motor which drives the front wheels it doesn't sound like much but it's a punchy little thing in a small car which helps the electric mini live up to that cooper s promise sold by its exterior in fact it will still sprint from zero to 100 kilometers in 7.3 seconds which while not necessarily impressive for an electric car isn't too shabby by warm hatch standards okay let's cover off our range charging and our battery so the mini cooper electric has a battery which is a smidge over 30 kilowatt hours and that's not a whole lot it only grants the car a range of just over 200 kilometers and that's not great either but again that's not the point of the car having a battery so small keeps it really light so that's really neat and also having a battery this small means that you can charge it up really quickly so on a dc charger at 50 kilowatts you can charge it up in just over 30 minutes but importantly on an ac charger and this is where this car really comes into its own it has what i would consider an over spec ac charger so it charges at a rate of 11 kilowatts on on one of those plugs and that means that you can charge it up in just over two and a half hours from virtually nothing on an ac plug that's a grocery shop's worth of charging to get a full charge a small advantage of having a small battery and mini could have easily given this car a 7.2 kilowatt charger which still wouldn't have been too bad considering the battery size or worse still a 3.6 kilowatt hour charger which is what many brands with cars batteries this size do so i'm really impressed with that that's probably one of the headline specs for this car the fact you can charge it so fast on ac it makes charging really convenient just a quick word on kilowatt hours to 100 kilometers that new energy efficiency standards many would argue that the battery pack is relatively light and therefore allows the car to maintain its signature driving experience look if that's true in a moment but its electric consumption is rated at 17.5 kilowatt hours to 100 kilometers now while that consumption number doesn't sound amazing for such a small car i achieved a much more reasonable number of 14 kilowatt hours to 100 kilometers in an earlier week-long test that's not bad at all okay so all the specs and style in the world is great but for me the real selling point of the mini electric is the experience behind the wheel because it really nails all of those mini cornerstones it's light it's connected it's firm you feel everything that's going on at the front wheels at the road and that's something that so few electric cars have tackled let alone nailed there's something about this car which makes it truly fun to drive and it's one of the few cars that gives you a bit more hope that the electric future can really be fun the power figures aren't amazing but it is bloody quick when you put your foot down in sports mode it's just a little bit unhinged how quickly that torque arrives and the same could actually be said for the regen the regen is actually really good in this car you can recoup a lot of energy by using it with the only mild issue being that in the full regen mode it can be quite abrupt when you let your foot off the accelerator it's good because it's saving you as much energy as possible but it can just be a little stilted around town sometimes to give you an idea of how this car compares to its rivals on the road take a look at the model 3 for example that car is firm like this mini is but it misses a little bit of that connection to the road because of its weird steering tune and it's over techified interior and then there's other electric cars like the mx-30 which is also a light electric car like this but you're sitting too far off the ground to be as connected as this car feels in the corners again one of the major downsides of this car is that multimedia suite it is feeling a little old the nav has some interesting ideas about which direction you should go when you put an address in and the dial system here is cumbersome and like many old bmws which is where this system comes from there are just too many menus so it's not the easiest system to use while you're on the move i find myself wishing even for something like tesla's massive touch screen as flawed as it is the little dash here though is clever and quaint and it suits the character of the cast so well with that little analog dial flying up when you put your power power down and down when you put your regen down it it's just it's such a great little feature of this car that speaks to its character and look yes the ride is quite firm maybe too firm for some especially since it's a car best suited to driving around cities and if you live in a major one in australia like sydney you'll know how rough our roads can be so you might get batted about a little bit in this car but it's not as bad as it could be especially since it's got quite a few lithium batteries under the floor and it weighs significantly more than the combustion version it leaves you with a funny conundrum because this car is actually so much fun to drive on a curvy road you actually kind of want to seek those out you just have to hope that they're within distance of your limited range and just a word on adjustability because i do like an electric car where you can sort of change it around and customize it to your own driving preference and in the mini you've got a little switch down on the dash here that adjusts either a low regen setting mode which is quite unobtrusive um so if you're more used to driving a combustion car maybe you'd like to use that mode or there's a heavier regen mode and as i said before that can be a little bit stilted if you set that to max so keep that in mind as well there's also multiple driving modes there's an efficiency mode uh called green plus which is quite handy to have although you have to do without some of this car's luxuries if you put it in green plus mode it turns the accelerator response all the way down and it even switches the air conditioning off so i think you'd probably need to be wanting to make the absolute most of this car's range to have to use that function but it's nice that it has it despite its relative age the cooper comes with some of the key active safety items that we like to see on all cars read about them on our written review at carsguy.com but it is worth noting this little hatch only has a four star and cap safety rating on the one hand it achieved this before it had been updated with some of these key safety items but on the other hand it is to a very old 2014 standard so who knows how it would perform in an up-to-date test mini sits under the bmw umbrella a brand which is a famous laggard for its three-year warranty it covers unlimited kilometers and does include roadside assist and the battery components are covered by a more industry standard eight year and 160 thousand kilometer warranty but it would still be nice to see improvement here on the topic of servicing minis have condition based intervals which means the car will tell you when it's time to visit a workshop service costs are interesting a basic pack covering six years costs just 1280 or smidge over 200 a year this includes filters fluids and checks meanwhile the much more expansive plus pack costs over four grand for the same six year period but it does include expendable items like brake pads and discs as well as things like windscreen wipers okay time for a verdict i think the mini cooper is really surprising it's fun to drive it sells that mini promise it feels really lightweight and it takes on that issue of drivability so well no other electric car is doing that this is genuinely a fun little car to drive most of its drawbacks are the same as the rest of the cooper range that old multimedia system it's tiny on the inside i mean it is a mini but all in all that's not the electric car's fault and this is probably the best version of the cooper you can buy it and as i said at the beginning possibly the most underrated electric car on sale in australia you
19;Mini;2023 Mini Cooper SE;Here's Why You Should NEVER Buy the Mini Cooper Electric | 2023 Mini Cooper Review;today we're going to review the 2023 Mini Cooper Electric the most disappointing car I've reviewed so far in this channel here's all the topics we'll discuss in this video let's get started okay let's get real here why the hell am I comparing a subc compact to a midsize sedan here's the kicker there's only a $1,000 difference between the Mini Cooper Electric and the base model 3 like seriously I wouldn't blame you for clicking away right now are you gone but if you're still here seriously drop a comment on why the would someone buy this mini all right so the wheelbase is attached shorter than the model 3 just 15 in maybe that's their excuse for a smaller battery this Mighty Mini Cooper Electric is equipped with a 32 KW battery pack granting it a laughable 112 M of range do you grasp what2 Mi of range translate to in cold weather it's a measly 80 Mi of real world range factor in that these Mini Cooper Electric comes in with lithiumion batteries that shouldn't be charged Beyond 80% or so for daily driving you're left with about 64 M of range that's barely enough to and from work and maybe you can run a few errands why subject yourself to such torture in contrast the model 3 bols a 60 Kow battery pack almost doubl that of the mini and delivers about 428 km of driving range plus thanks to the lfp battery you can utilize the full 100% daily without battery degradation not just the 80% like the mini and with the cold weather that we get up here in Canada you'll be able to get about 250 to 300 km of drivable range every single day the sole perk with the Mini Cooper Electric perhaps is basically the front wheeel drive while the base model 3 is a rear wheel drive sure the mini might have a little bit of better traction just because it's frm wheeel drive but the model 3 isn't really slacking let's remember we aren't really racing so this minor Edge doesn't really make up for the mere $11,000 price drop in my book the Mini Cooper Electric retains the iconic and unmistakable mini design reminiscent of its predecessors the car's front Sports the signature round headlights synonymous with the Brand's Timeless character however a notable departure from the classic Mini is the absence of the traditional Grill instead we have a Sleek uninterrupted curve hinting at its electric nature taking a look at the back of the Mini Cooper Electric the first thing that grabs your attention is the unique tail lights with the unmistakable Union Jack design then there's the well-placed Cooper S Insignia hinting at the car sporty nature without any exhaust pipes it's a clear reminder of its electric Sole and the solid bumper gives it a grounded sturdy look it's clear that BMW track to make this mini blend in and have that classic charm with Modern Electric Vibes I just wish they did a better job with pricing opening up the rear end of the Mini Cooper Electric surprisingly even though the mini boasts a hatchback design its storage capacity is significantly smaller than the model 3 it's quite the contradiction considering hatchbacks are often louded for their versatility in cargo management with the mini it seems your trading off utility for that iconic design a choice po potential buyers especially here in North America should seriously contemplate I guess the second advantage of the mini is that you do get a mobile home charger you have a Nema 515 which is basically 120 volt Outlet which you can use to plug in anywhere or you have the more powerful Nemo variant which can charge a little bit faster you do of course unless you're in the UK you need to install a 240 volt Outlet in your garage again this included charger still does not excuse the price $1,000 difference this charger only cost about $315 Canadian dollar at the Tesla store also Tesla did provide mobile chargers previously with their cars but they decided to stop partly of course to reduce costs but they also saw in their data that a lot of people weren't using these mobile chargers personally I only need the j1772 plug I don't even use the mobile charger that came with the car and Tesla vehicles right now does not come with the mobile charger anymore but it does come in included with the j1772 plug which you can use to plug into any public Chargers and a lot of Manufacturers here in North America converting to NS adapters this will not be an issue in the upcoming future stepping into the Mini Cooper Electric there's an uncanny sense of deja vu the interior is strikingly identical to its gasoline counterpart one might expect some distinction given its electric nature but it's hard to discern any it feels like a Mist on opportunity to truly differentiate and modernize the cabin for its electric era and I guess another advantage of this mini is that it is a BMW after all the interior quality is much much better than the Tesla I'll show you guys the rear seats here I have no idea who would fit into those bucket seats maybe someone can cramp in there for a short short drive or you can just put a child seat back there I don't see a grown human being being fitting and being comfortable on those seats again I understand that the mini is a mini car it's a subcompact car but I only say this because it's a $1,000 difference and the leg space in the model 3 is amazing I do understand that it's a bit unfair comparing a sub compact car with a sedan but Tesla doesn't have a subc compact car yet and also the 1,000 price difference I feel like this is a quite fair comparison what do you guys think let me know down in the comment section while while I may have reservations about the interior it's undeniable that it appeals to a specific audience the Mini Cooper Electric presents a circular Centric design that's distinctive and might resonate with purists for a dedicated Mini Cooper Enthusiast the transition to this electric version might feel seamless given the lack of drastic changes in the design language the start button here and the gear shifting knob is exactly the same with its gas counterpart in the Mini Cooper Electric you of course have the premium Harmon Garden speakers delivering a crisp and immersive audio but the Tesla Model 3 isn't really lagging far behind in the sound Department its audio system although not branded provides a rich and clear listening experience making both cars feel quite competitive in terms of audio Tesla rather shelling out the big bucks for the Branded audio systems they made a strategic decision instead of Licensing they redirected those funds to their engineering team tasking them with crafting the highest quality in-house sound system this decision not only speaks to Tesla's Innovative Spirit but also their confidence in delivering a top tier audio experience without relying on external brand names if you have ever been on a Tesla yourself you know that their speaker and sound quality is not too far off from the name brands one other area and this is probably the last one where the Mini Cooper has a slight Advantage is that the turning radius as if it wasn't obvious is a little bit better than the model 3 the model 3 has a turning radius of about 19 ft in contrast the Mini Cooper outshines with a tighter radius of about 17 ft the advantage in the turning radius might make the Mini Cooper Electric a viable choice for those in the UK or other densely packed cities where tighter Maneuvers are essential but for the sprawling Urban landscape of North America the model 3's 19 ft turning radius is more than sufficient it's challenging to justify choosing the mini especially considering the mere $1,000 and that's Canadian dollars price difference with the model 3 to my viewers in the UK or similar Urban settings does that twoot turning radius Advantage truly make a significant difference for you I'm honestly genuinely curious when you talk 0 to 60 the Mini Cooper Electric clocks in at 6.5 seconds while the Tesla Model 3 beats it slightly at 6.1 seconds for the Zera 60 many Cooper is $1,000 Canadian dollar cheaper but you're only sacrificing 0.4 seconds of the 0 to 60 but hey you have a better turning radius it comes included with home charging and a better interior quality speaking of 0 to 60 the Mini Cooper Electric has a neat little feature worth mentioning engage sports mode and watch as the center console and the ambient lighting immediately shift to an intense red Hue all right are you ready for the 0 to 60 here we [Music] go there is no denying that the Mini Cooper Electric is a fun to drive car its maneuverability arguably has the slight Edge over the model 3 at the price point of $330,000 Canadian I genuinely believe manyi would see these cars flying off the Lots especially among urbanites who don't really Venture on lengthy road trips like I do and predominantly navigate on city streets given that Tesla hasn't tapped into the sub $330,000 market yet mini had a golden chance here they could have positioned the Cooper Electric as a go-to option for those shopping in that price bracket mini had a clear window to capture a significant market share but it feels like they let that opportunity slip through their fingers that wraps up my review for today I genuinely hope you found it insightful if you've stuck around till now chime in below if I've overlooked something or if you've got reasons to justify the $52,000 Canadian price tag on the mini just a grand shy of

20;Mini;2023 Mini Cooper SE;Mini Cooper Electric 2023 SE Resolute | Does Electric Mean Better? | Drive.com.au;this here is the Mini Cooper S EV it's a three-door hatch which means that it's mini it also means that parking it no problem Lane waves just like this one not a hassle but just because it's a small car doesn't mean that it doesn't have a big personality but with an electric motor instead of a petrol engine is it still the true mini that we all know and maybe even love in this video we're going to find out if this car is still iconically fun foreign the Mini Cooper Electric has been around for quite some time now it's available in two trim grades the mini yours and the Resolute this one is the Resolute Edition with this trim you get a bunch of additional nicenies including the Resolute Bonnet strikes mini yours leather lounge and carbon black Resolute Nappa leather steering wheel panoramic sunroof seat heating for the front row and Harman Kardon sound system to name a few this Mini Cooper EV will set you back 65 325 plus on-road costs there's an electric motor powering the front wheels via a one-speed automatic transmission plus a 32.6 kilowatt hour lithium-ion battery generating maximum outputs of 135 kilowatts and 270 newton meters the mini electric has a claimed driving range of 222 kilometers in the front of the mini and you'll notice that that personality on the outside continues to the inside straight up one of my favorite things about the interior of this car is this right here are the circular infotainment system in it houses an 8.8 inch touchscreen and it's really cool because whenever you adjust the dials with your heating or your cooling or your music track and change the volume it lights up in different colors around the outside then you've got the oblong digital instrument cluster which doesn't have a whole heap of information in there but it's actually really tidy really easy to use so some people might jump in this car and think oh yeah okay it looks like a mini nothing's changed maybe it's aged a little bit yes they have kept it quite the same but I actually still think it feels quite plush and I'm going to use the word cute in here lots of circular fun features there are circular features on the door handles and around those Harman Kardon speakers something else to note is these seats Nappa leather seats really comfortable really supportive you've got a leather steering wheel and I think the build quality in here is actually really good so all up here on the dash that's actually really quite soft you don't really see any hard plastics until you go further down on the dash and on the doors in terms of storage you're in a hatch so yes there's not a heap of room but you've got more than enough to get the job done I can fit my large drink bottle in here so two cup holders and then you've got a little storage compartment down here which does fill up pretty quickly some storage here too because this is raised so you've got a nice Gap there for larger items and then funnily enough I don't usually fit my phone in a mini this is a wireless charge pad and it is quite small so if you've got a larger phone that probably won't work well for you but I've got a newer smaller iPhone and it fits perfectly and charges that works this also does have wireless Apple carplay but doesn't support Android auto you've got some really cute looking dials around here your stop start button as well and they've stuck with some Shortcut features so they do get buttons you do get dials which I'm really happy with because we see a lot of that coming out of new cars now and all being thrown into the touch screen you've got your steering wheel controls and just like a BMW you've got your rotary dial here as well and plenty of shortcuts so everything is really easy on the go the only thing that I had to get used to with the changing your tracks on the steering wheel rather than just clicking right or left you actually have to click down and then select your song so I end up turning my music up really loud sometimes instead as a mistake but no problem with that this has a premium Harman Kardon sound system so all in all it's really lovely in here and you get a nice big summary of two okay so getting into the back of the mini I can't believe that I used to own a three door and used to have to go through all of this but there you go you got your latch there so how easy is it to jump in that's fine plenty of room good door aperture I have to mention though those front seats while they're heated they're actually not electric so you've got a manual adjustment there I would have expected electric seats for this price point all right in the back here I'm going to move that there okay so that would be my driving position I'm 173 centimeters so yeah it's not really built for tallies I mean there's not heap of leg room and toe room but the Headroom is pretty decent I don't think this car is built for families you're not going to use this as a family car they are isofix mounting points though if you did want to use it as that and in the way of nice it is while you've got your summary for as I said you get a cup holder here one cup holder on either side you've got those speakers back here as well the seats are still really comfortable obviously you're not getting that recline but as I said nipple leather seats lots of bolstering and that that's really all you get back here so yes you can fit two adults back here it gets the job done but it is still yes a very mini hatch now I just need to try and get out so okay the latch and push does it all in one motion so it's pretty easy [Music] okay so let's check out the boot no power tailgate when you close it that's a really really loud alarming noise but anyway opening the boot and there's 211 liters of cargo space a little bit down on some of its competitors something like the Cooper born has 385 but you do get some underfloor storage here too which is really handy for a small car and that's where you can pop your charging cable which comes with this mini now once you expand those seats because you can fold down these rear seats that gives you 731 liters just do the luggage test my cool funky luggage coming on this review with me that one fits there perfectly but I'm going to fold down the seats and try and fit both in which I'm sure we'll be able to do thank you in you could easily probably fit two of those in quite easily as well so there you have it Bang [Music] one of the first things that you'll notice about this car when you're behind the wheel and have to get used to is the music note that comes from this mini because a lot of electric cars you'd think are completely silent but that isn't the case with this card has like a bit of a jetsonsy noise it sounds like it's ready to launch so certainly something that you need to get used to but that's not to be confused with cabin noise because it's actually quite a silent cabin no tire noise coming into this car which is good so other than the synthesized noise or the music that's coming from that amazing Harman Kardon sound system it is actually a really nice enjoyable silent tissue Drive I think with electric cars a lot of the time they Venture quite far away from their petrol counterpart and they're not as familiar so that can be a bit of a turn off for people but one thing that I'm happy to say with this mini is that it remains true to its roots so yes in the way of handling in that go-kart feel this is still a true mini and still a lot of fun behind the wheel so yes it still has that mini handling the steering is a lot firmer something that I had to get a bit used on it love firmer steering and a firmer ride but it is a sporty cast that's something that you can expect but the steering is really responsive ride quality is great over those rougher surfaces it just Glides over speed humps so no complaints there one of the great things about driving this car is that it feels quite plush I know that yes the minis interior it hasn't changed for quite some time people say that it's aged but for me I have everything that I need everything is really simple in a good way and easy to use on the Move including the infotainment system everything connects really well and the seats are incredibly comfortable they're a Napa leather very supportive and in the way of safety it does have a bunch of standard safety features adaptive cruise control works perfectly on the freeway it does however miss out on Lane keep assist and blind spot monitoring which I think I would expect those features to come standard for this price point so let's talk about the range of this car around 222 kilometers claimed which no that is not a lot when we talk about electric cars these days all the new cars are coming out with closer to 400 there is a new version of this car coming that will be over 300K is closer to 400. so a real competitor of this car is probably the fee which unfortunately yes has more range and is cheaper mini claims 15.2 to 17.6 kilowatt hours I have certainly been over that at one stage or is it 19.2 right now I'm at 18.8 so it kind of depends how you're driving it as well I've been in sport mode on occasions I haven't been driving at all in green mode and I have had it in you can switch it in between high energy and low energy depending on what sort of driving you like to do if you're into the low pedal driving for me it's a little bit intense so I have actually kept it on low energy for most of my drives work for me is only around 15 K's away so when I arrive I probably had it sitting no more than 120 kilometers really I haven't gone to a DC fast charger and charger this week I've just been plugging it into the outlet at work so I'll get to work at around 90 K's and then over the seven eight hour period I'll get around 30k so that has been plenty for me and that is exactly the sort of driving that the buyer of a mini EB I believe is going to be doing so a second car or an urban Runabout it works perfectly for that situation okay I found something else fun in the mini now once your car is in green mode you can play a game we're calling it The Fish game James 40 Ward actually introduced me to it and it essentially judges your driving there's a little fish in a bowl and it jumps up when you get another star you need to get to five stars and it's based on your anticipation and acceleration I'm just going to preface this by telling you all that James did not clock this game so we still don't know what happens when you actually clock it I don't know if Minnie send you a gift who knows so let's keep driving along and see if I can actually win this game [Music] [Music] okay I've been driving for around 10 minutes playing this game stuck on four stars I need to pull up soon and I think it actually reboots when you turn off the car so obviously mini does not believe that James and I are fantastic drivers we don't get the ticket approval but anyway if anyone knows how to clock this game please let us know in the comments below foreign the Mini Cooper S EV doesn't remain loyal to its roots so I think I've already answered that in saying that it looks like a mini it acts like a mini it is lots of fun to drive as well a few downfalls I've already mentioned in the range and yes it is a bit pricier but if those don't matter to you and you want to make a statement this might just be the car for you if you're stepping into an electric vehicle if you want to know

21;Mini;2023 Mini Cooper SE;The 2023 Mini Cooper S E Is A Charmingly Quick Urban Electric Vehicle;over 20 years ago when many decided to return to North American Shores with the all-new Cooper it instantly won the hearts of many American fans because it had all of the same character of the original Mini Cooper that left the us all those years ago now of course with the industry continuing to move toward electrification many cannot Escape that fate either which is why I'm standing by this 2023 Mini Cooper SE technically the company introduced his car back in 2020 but they have made some changes to the vehicle since then which is why we are testing one out for a full week so we can put it through our usual battery of tests but the big question I want to answer at the end of this video has many continued to capture all of the charm and Charisma of the gas versions in the electric model stay tuned to find out [Music] now before we start talking about the styling of the 2023 Mini Cooper Electric let me go ahead and pop the hood because the million dollar question with a lot of EVS does it have a front and as you can see the mini begins life as an internal combustion vehicle so it does not have a frunk instead we have a single electric motor powering the front wheels now underneath this big plastic shroud you're going to find one electric motor like I said that gives this vehicle front wheel drive it's essentially a motor that was taken out of the old BMW I3 the number is pretty impressive in terms of power for just one electric motor 181 horsepower and 199 pound-feet of torque those output figures basically match the gas powered Mini Cooper S which is why this is called the Mini Cooper S E the E being it stands for electric and this vehicle also has a 32.6 kilowatt hour lithium-ion battery pack that lines the floor that essentially will give it up to 114 miles of Eva only range it all goes out through a one speed reduction Gear transmission and mini says that this vehicle should get to 60 in around 6.9 seconds we'll test it out with our equipment and this vehicle has a top speed of around 190 or I'm sorry just 93 miles an hour not 193 miles an hour so just under 100 miles an hour that's technically govern limited and compared to the gas powered mini this is about 200 pounds heavier but it's still among the lightest ever for an electric vehicle at just over 3 200 pounds but let's go ahead and close the hood which I love by the way how the headlights stay in place and it goes kind of over the hood now unlike the 2020 model that I showed you guys last time for the Cooper SE many gave this car the updated front fascia a couple years ago that they introduced on the gas powered mini you can see the signature circular bug eye headlights are apparent I don't like however how there's still this fake hood scoop here because again this is not an internal combustion vehicle we have the updated front end with the larger Grille with this kind of bar that is now body color that was in introduced on the pre on the refresh model you can see full LED headlights are standard on all the Cooper SES I like the Halo LED daytime running light and turn signal LED low and high beams no fog lights on this vehicle you do have some functional air vents there that allow air to pass through along with more functional vents at the front which again not really necessary for this vehicle you can't really tell from this angle that this is the electric model there's just a yellow s badge here that's going to let you know that this is the electric version now looking around the side profile you can see the Cooper SE only comes as the hatchback two-door mini also makes a four-door they also make a convertible sadly you can't get the electric version to any of those other body styles they only offer it in this there are rumors of them offering a convertible version of this but that has not been confirmed by many uh just yet now looking at the overall proportions at the side this is among the smallest vehicles that you can buy at 151.7 inches long it's about an inch shorter than the gas model surprisingly I wasn't expecting that it has like a 98 inch long wheelbase and then minis offer several different choices of Wheels the base Wheels 16 inch wheel this is the 17 inch Sparkle Sparkle Silver tentacle wheel not my favorite in terms of a wheel design they also offer a black finish on it and other different black wheels you can also see there are these unpainted wheel arches over there along with the unpainted side skirt you have an S badge over here with an LED daytime or LED turn signal over here yellow painted side mirrors which goes really nicely with the yellow cloth and leather red seats you can see my tester also has a black roof which you can also get a white roof or a multi-colored roof it also has an opening panoramic glass sunroof as well which is nice some more Chrome along the Belt Line and overall this car is certainly distinctive I just think this particular spec doesn't speak to me I would probably get this car in British racing green with black wheels and a black roof just make it look a little bit more aggressive a little bit more masculine the rear I never really warmed up to the rear end styling of this third generation Cooper when it came out in 2013 it's just got these huge tail lights I don't like how big they are they are an LED design you can see the British flag is kind of Incorporated in the actual tail light modules with more Chrome and then you can see here this is the electric badge along with the yellow Cooper S badge and then obviously being the electric model there's no visible exhaust tips you're not going to need that when you have it on an electric vehicle now opening up the trunk area the two-door is very small in terms of the cargo space you only get around 8.7 cubic feet of space you can see it probably just has enough room for my 21 inch roller bag and a backpack underneath here however there is a pretty deep underfloor storage area you can see these are the Chargers and the box for the Cooper SE that's actually a Fix-A-Flat kit you can see it has a BMW logo on it because this vehicle does not have a temporary spare tire if you fold down the seats which by the way you can do that pretty quickly it's not a completely flat floor but you do expand it out to around 32 cubic feet of space so that's much more usable but then that that makes this car just a two-seater vehicle as opposed to a five-seater vehicle moving on to the interior of the 2023 Mini Cooper SE let me first show you guys the key fob for the vehicle as you can see mini has its own unique fob to other BMW products you can tell the buttons come from the BMW family but you used to have to insert this key into the ignition you no longer have to do that because it has their smart key access system you can see there's a lock unlock open up the trunk button and there's a panic button somewhere although I can't seem to find the panic button right now uh just by looking at this key I don't know if Mini offers a phone as a key feature just yet that is a newer technology that BMW vehicles have but many I don't think has that feature just yet but as you open the door you can see the two-door variant uh has this really cool interior color combination or at least my particular tester does it kind of has like a two-tone combination of a leatherette with this really interesting kind of plaid like material where it's fabric these seats are three level heated which is still very nice they are manually adjusting seats so no memory seating or anything like that I don't think Mini offers a power seat if I remember correctly so that's something to kind of keep in mind lines remember this is supposed to be a small more economy style car but it has just a lot more character versus some other types of vehicles you can see the door panel here has pretty decent materials it's a soft touch injection molded plastic a lot of piano black plastic trim my tester also has the Harman Kardon stereo which is definitely nice sounding and then you have a padded armrest over here window controls Chrome plated and they're one touch automatic up down for both windows which is definitely nice you have a little bit of storage along with hard touch panels over there now stepping inside this vehicle has about five inches of ground clearance so it has a lower step in height and as I get an inch out the door the door has a relatively solid sounding thunk so that actually aids to that impression of quality with this vehicle but when you want to start it up you can see mini puts the button right here or it's technically a toggle you have to put your foot on brake and then just kind of push that down and then mini has a really interesting startup chime in this vehicle That's Unique than the versus the gas powered models it almost tries to make it seem more like a spaceship which is kind of going with the theme of the electric model you can see the dashboard layout is pretty familiar with the gas powered mini I really am looking forward to many doing away with this more traditional look for the layout it kind of um really just hampers them in terms of Technology you have a reskinned version of BMW's iDrive here I think they just call it Mini connect it's an 8.8 inch display here you can see my phone paired up pretty quick it's got Wireless carplay and Android auto I believe and then the materials here at the upper dashboard is a soft touch injection molded plastic you have this really cool looking textured this is the electric trim it's plastic but it has like this weird texture to it to try that I guess makes it feel electric there's also a heads up display that flips up I don't like how it's the flip up style I prefer it to be just projected into the windshield it kind of just takes away from the heads-up display it's a little distracting for me the steering wheel you can see is a manual tilt and telescoping you do have pretty good adjustability and range the horn oh wow it actually sounds really mean considering how tiny this car is like the horn and the Toyota Supra sounds pathetic but that actually sounds pretty good it literally screams Fu I'm a small car get out of my way anyways you can see this Center display used to be the tachometer as you can see many went away with that are the speedometer and tachometer they've made it done away with that and they put a digital display over here it's starting to look a little bit dated but it's nice that they give you one that's front and center in the instrument panel so now this just basically has your hazard switch and the 8.8 inch screen you have a volume knob here you can also adjust your radio sources there's the mini display here which also includes embedded GPS which the GPS is fine again it kind of reminds me of a BMW this is the same interface you also have the Mini connect controller here which you can use if you don't want to touch the screen but again the touch screen works well in terms of storage this vehicle is lacking a little bit on that you can see there's a place where you can store a few things like your sunglasses you have a USB a charging port cup holders here a few more buttons here for the Dual Zone climate control I mentioned earlier three level heated seats parking sensors this is for adjusting the regen brake you have your choice between low or high regenerative braking and then you can also turn off the stability control your drive mode selector you can see there's a sport mode which shows you a graphical there a graphic there and then there's a balance setting a green and then a green plus that's going to give you the most range but it's also going to sacrifice acceleration and the air conditioning if you put it in the green plus this electronic shifter controls the one speed reduction Gear transmission you can see you put in Reverse it has a backup camera um and it also has automatic parallel parking functions I believe I have somebody has turned off the trajectory it looks like there we go so there's the trajectory it's active trajectory so the camera quality and resolution is perfectly fine uh I just wish it took up the entire screen you can see it also has parking sensors electronic parking brake and then over here padded center console which has actually some storage in there which is nice you can also lift this up you can see my phone fits in there but there's no wireless phone charging pad in this car I don't know if you can get it as an accessory uh that flips up you can also kind of adjust that uh the seats they do they are a little constrict or confining um you can't adjust the bolsters but I like this kind of two-tone cloth material there's also a pretty noticeable thigh Extender on both front seats which is nice manual seat as well on the passenger side the seats definitely look cool the glove box you can see is uh damped but not lined with felt it's actually a pretty decent sized glove box and then over here you can see there are some controls for the map lighting and then you can also open up the sunroof where you can tilt it or you can open up completely I love how many gives you that because it just kind of adds to the open and airiness of this cabin that's the biggest that it's going to open but again very nice how they give you an opening sunroof to kind of give the cabin more even more space there's also a sunshine here although this still lets in light when you have it closed but overall the interior definitely feels on the smaller end the dash is also kind of far away from you but in terms of materials quality I think it's perfectly acceptable considering the price of this particular model however there are some Minis that can go closer to fifty thousand dollars that's too expensive but I think in the mid thirty thousand dollar range this interior is perfectly fine so let me go ahead and show you guys the back seat because there is a back seat back here and to get back here you have to basically on both sides you can pull this lever that's going to manually move the seat forward which is technically an easier way versus the power seat now um I'm not very tall guys I'm five foot seven so let me go ahead and entertain you all by showing you what the space is like back here now first of all um this seat when you pull it back it actually doesn't come back so as you can see there the front passenger doesn't have a lot of room this is my driving position so this is where I'd have the seat to drive as you can see there is the leg room here's the leg room when this seat doesn't come back which this is perfectly acceptable for me but if I was going to come over here and show you guys what it's like to sit behind myself okay so I can't get my feet underneath the seat because there's a decent amount of foot space my knees are not touching but my shins are touching the back of the seat so this is nice and padded you have two storage Pockets an armrest here and armrest here and then lots of Hard touch materials I do like how there's a sunroof back here which is definitely nice and then if you look over here you can see I'm five foot seven so I have a decent amount of Headroom but for those of you who are over six feet tall it's not going to be a comfortable place you can close this as well which is nice this is all hard touch materials you cannot fit three across I'm sorry this only seats four I think I mentioned earlier it actually seats five it only seats four but overall for kids or somebody under five foot eight like my height or under five foot nine you can sit back here in a pinch but uh you might want to go for the four-door or the Countryman if you need more space so we are back in the all-electric Mini Cooper SE the last time I had a chance to drive this vehicle I was on the media drive for it almost three years ago because 2020 is when this car first came out and the SE is basically designed to be the electric version of the Cooper S and we have a single electric motor at the front a 32 kilowatt hour battery pack a 181 horsepower so slightly less horsepower and slightly less torque versus the gas version but mini says this will do 0-16 around 6.9 seconds I never actually got a chance to test this car uh when I first drove it but now that we have our equipment we have it back home let's go ahead and see what we can actually get now make sure it's in sport mode which you just flick this little toggle up put it into sport traction as well because this is a front wheel drive car I don't want it to cut power let's see what we can get foreign actually no drama there even with the traction control off I was surprised wow 6.05 seconds that's actually pretty fast I wasn't expecting it to be almost a second faster than what many claims now granted the uh Germans although this is technically the British brand but it's owned by BMW as you guys know tend to be conservative but six seconds is plenty quick for something like this and even though this is car's only front wheel drive it puts the power down really well um it doesn't really have launch control I tried brake charging there but it doesn't really do anything uh the regen breaking in this car is either low or high I have it in high setting now and I really like the wet region breaking it feels like it's almost like a one pedal drive effect so it's nice that they do you know include of that uh ability to do either a low or a high region I think it's just important for people to have that kind of uh ability to kind of choose flooring it from a stop there without break torquing it 6.38 and this is with it going slightly uphill so again pretty solid performance and I wasn't expecting it to be this much quicker than versus what minis claim so I have no complaints with the acceleration I suspect this car is actually quicker versus its gas counterpart even if you guys go for the automatic version of that the Dual clutch the automatic or the electric mini just is going to be quick off the line because it's got one gear it has no delays in terms of the transmission shifting or the turbos spooling up just put your foot down in there there it actually spun out the tires a little bit there oh that's pretty fun I like this car a lot I mean what's cool about the Cooper electrics this thing really just keeps the kind of fun go-kart nature of the mini but it almost makes it feel like you're driving a go-kart an electric go-kart or an electric golf cart uh because this vehicle is just so playful the suspension is really well uh sorted for handling uh the 17-inch wheels on my tester not my favorite design but they surprisingly have good grip for a car like this the weight of the Cooper SE this is about 200 ish pounds heavier than the gas version I don't really feel it the weight to be honest it still feels like a really light car I mean this is one of the lightest electric vehicles you can buy at 3 200 pounds and it just feels so alive I love how the steering talks to you I like how the chassis just is very neutral you don't feel like you're gonna get into trouble with this car it just feels like a point and uh shoot kind of little hatch a little bit of torque steer there with the traction control off just putting my foot down that's hilarious [Laughter] yeah I mean I really like this car when I first drove it three years ago but um it's a fun little Urban Runabout type of vehicle I mean really the most disappointing aspect about the Mini Cooper SE is the range I mean 114 miles is what many claims and in my weeks for the testing I only saw around 110 miles on the full charge um that is perfectly acceptable if you guys live in an urban environment however as you can see from where I'm at here in the country part of Pennsylvania um this kind of range is perfectly fine for around town but as soon as I want to take like a longer trip to go for example the closest airport for me is about 70 miles away I could get there on a full charge but when I get there I'm gonna have to plug it in otherwise when I leave the airport to come back I'll have to find a charging spot or a charging station to plug in at and this is accepting a maximum of 50 kilowatts so it's on the slower end but in terms of range I think for the Next Generation many should consider doubling the range I mean 200 miles is the more acceptable range especially for an EV even in this size category evm this is certainly a unique vehicle but I think the Next Generation should have at least 200 miles of range I would love to see many offer all-wheel drive although they've never done an all-wheel drive gas version so I suspect the Cooper will continue to be front-wheel drive only but in terms of refinement we'll switch the drive mode here just go into mid there's like a green mode also that'll increase the range we'll also turn the traction control back on in terms of daily driving the Cooper SE this actually rides better than the regular mini it's because of the battery pack that's kind of pushing down on the car it feels really planted it's also really quiet I mean the four-cylinder turbo and the minis they sound okay they're not wonderful sounding they sound a little augmented as well so this kind of gets rid of that you go with all a completely quiet Driving Experience which is kind of nice visibility is excellent you can see out of the fronts the sides the back remember you're driving a car that's 151 inches long this is among the smallest new vehicles you can buy a Miata is bigger than this vehicle which is insane uh and in terms of driver assistance Tech this car does have automatic emergency braking it's got Lane um Lane change assist I believe uh our lane keeping assist but it doesn't have adaptive cruise control meaning does not offer adaptive cruise control which might actually be the right decision because this is not something that I would take on longer trips anyways so you're not even going to miss the adaptive cruise it would be nice again if they offer it but if they're going to offer that feature they need to double double the range of this car in terms of the tech the wireless carplay is nice this is essentially a a reskinned version of BMW's old iDrive 7. I'm really looking forward to the next Generation where mini kind of does away with this dashboard design the steering feels nice in your hands it has good feedback the heads-up display in this car while it is nice I don't like that screen that flips up it just kind of makes the whole experience look a little cheap but overall still love this car a lot I really would love to see Minnie do a convertible version of this car before they decide to do away and go to the Next Generation there's rumors of it but no confirmation yet for many but overall still a great electric kind of go-kart like machine but it is no longer sadly the cheapest new electric EV that you can buy in the US so after spending a full week with the all-electric Mini Cooper SE I can comfortably say that mini continues to capture all of the charm and Charisma from the gas model of course you are missing the snarl that you get from the exhaust and the burbles you get from the Dual clutch Transmission in the regular s however what you do get is a car that's way more efficient that's actually a little bit quicker that is a lot cheaper to run because as you guys know electricity is cheap especially if you have it plugged in at your home and even though the range is not great 110 miles in my real world testing I think it's terrible if you guys plan to use this as your only vehicle as a second car where you can drive it around town and you like small Vehicles it makes perfect sense and I think that's partly the reason of the Mini Cooper SE I do hope that many decides to offer it as a convertible because the convertible aspect just makes this car even more fun so before they decide to introduce the new generation which they are working on it would be nice to see them offer it as a convertible in terms of the pricing if you guys are looking to buy this vehicle it starts around on thirty four thousand dollars it's around two thousand dollars more expensive versus a standard Mini Cooper S now two thousand dollars more is actually kind of a steal and that was kind of the charm of the Cooper SC when it first came out is it was one of the most affordable EVS on the market however because of the inflation reduction act this vehicle is built in the UK so it no longer qualifies for the 7 500 federal tax credit so my tester here is a little over thirty five thousand dollars with basically the 900 driver assistance package that still lacks adaptive cruise control so you're gonna be paying that price essentially and you no longer get the federal tax credit so the cheapest EV is no longer this vehicle you're gonna have to buy and wait for like a Chevrolet bolt that will be the cheapest EV however two thousand dollars more expensive versus the gas powered mini I'd say that this is still uh worth a look as long as you guys are okay with the 110 mile Real World Range that's something you're gonna have to get used to and be sure to remember to plug it in frequently but if you're using it as a second car that shouldn't be a problem but for the Next Generation and I would like to see mini essentially double the range for this vehicle with all that said hope you guys have enjoyed my full overview on the 2023 Mini Cooper SE if you're also looking to see the latest cars I'm testing be sure to follow me on Instagram at Redline underscore reviews like us on Facebook and as always guys please keep subscribing to the redline reviews YouTube channel for all the latest reviews thank you so much for watching I'll catch you all in the next video [Music]
22;Mini;2023 Mini Cooper SE;2023 Mini Cooper SE Ownership Review - First 1,000 Miles;foreign [Music] welcome back to another freezing cold everyday EV video for today's video we are doing an ownership first impression of the first 1000 miles of our 2023 Mini Cooper SE so we're going to give you guys a full tour of all the options that we picked here for our Mini Cooper SE and what our overall thoughts are any pros or any cons that we have had with this vehicle or any problems that we have had over the first Thousand Miles yes and the full review of our Mini Cooper will become to clean Technica soon so definitely stay tuned for that and let's dive in before we dive into what options we went with for our Mini Cooper on the exterior let's talk about why I primarily picked this vehicle now we were looking for a second vehicle after having our Tesla for about six seven months we realized we did need a second vehicle now we did have a price limit of about thirty five thousand dollars is the max we wanted to spend on our second car we looked at a number of used EVS like smaller EV is like for example the Chevy Spark EV looked at a first generation Nissan Leaf we also looked at a second generation smart for two electric but we didn't really like how those drove we were lucky enough to be able to get a chance to drive the demo version that our dealership our main dealership here had here of a Mini Cooper Electric Car 2023 and after spending a whole day with it I fell in love with it now a previous this by saying that I did sell my 1994 Mazda Miata that I had for quite some time I sold it a year before I got this it was just becoming too much of Maintenance and with the gas cost and everything I just didn't really want to deal with it the fun Factor was high on my priority when it came to our second EV and this definitely delivers it and we'll get into what we feel like it delivers for driving Impressions later on but after test driving one for an entire day definitely fell in love placed the order took about four to six months which is pretty typical about what it is right now now we picked the signature plus 2.0 trim for 2023 I really wanted the base model because I just wanted it to be a standard mini I wanted to spend as less as I could possibly could they're not making that trim for 2023 so we just have a signature plus 2.0 and I'm actually really really happy that we went with this trim because it does have some features of the base model from before does not have that I'm so glad that it now has so we this vehicle all in all with all the options we only picked a few options for this vehicle was about 35 000 so right about our our price point that we wanted to spend we went with the British racing green exterior we've never had a green car before we wanted to try it out and I have to say we love this color it's very metallicky it looks really great in the sunlight even here on a Winter's day it also looks really nice as well now one thing we did ad is I really wanted to have Bonnet Stripes just like the original minis now we did go with a green and black combination which I kind of like better than the white roof for example but really these burning Stripes I think it makes it looks very much like a mini now what's really cool about the Mini Cooper SE is at least for 2023 there's a number of wheel options that you can pick for your Mini Cooper Electric this also does vary slightly if you get the top trim which is the iconic trim now if you were to get the icon trim which we didn't spend like spending almost you know forty thousand dollars for that all the trim here on the headlights and also the Beltline trim and other accents would have been a gloss black which really isn't a big deal to us because I actually kind of like the way this chrome looks here on our vehicle but we went with the 17 inch pedal Wheels as they're called I really like the design they kind of have this neat little Groove in here now we are wearing the verstein uh wind Track Pro winter tires right now because it is winter time and trying to drive on summer Tires is a big No-No for us here it gets way too cold for that and the car wouldn't be able to handle that so for now we just swap the tires cut the standard wheels that we got on the Mini Cooper I love the little accents that you get across the vehicle that's one thing where you can distinguish a electric versus a non-electric mini cooper it's just all these little yellow green accents they have across the board but I love these wheels these are probably my favorite that I assume which those are going to go for 16s but I kind of like the way the 17s fill out the wheel well here on the Mini Cooper now on the side just like the front the S will be kind of in that same little electric you know yellow green that they have for minis I like these little touches of electrification that many includes for the SE now here on the top I we did go with the black roof and then the black mirror caps and it gives it you know a pretty nice little look now we did have the windows tinted I always have to have those tinted so it looks really nice and cohesive with the black roof and I really love the way that looks now one little element that I love about the design of the vehicle is the little charge port emblem that you have right here where you can press it and then you have your charge port right here and speaking about this we primarily charge at home basically just on a level two if we need to charge at a fast charger like an evgo or Electrify America we can we have a few times just to kind of try it out this does charge at a Max of 50 kilowatts or a green four or so really not that fast but we're really just keeping this to a city car so we're not really going to take too many trips on this vehicle I can't remember back I we did get the mud flaps and we do have an accessory video for that to add those from mini just so we had that too I also love the design element of the Union Jack tail lights they are full LED and I actually did recently change this bulb some of the bulbs here on the mini are halogen like the cargo light and then also the reverse light in the glove box I changed all those to LED that way it looks a little bit crisper but I like these way the tail lights look they look super cool I like the spoiler I just like the Hatchy design of the Mini Cooper SE in general we love hatchbacks I've had a number of wagons as well so I kind of like the square back that the Mini Cooper hardtop offers I also like that right back here you also have that same emblem that you have on the charge port that is outlined here in that kind of looks like a little plug and I kind of like that it's pretty unique but this is basically what we picked for the exterior of our 2023 Mini Cooper SE I'm kind of I'm really happy with the way this car look looks it looks fantastic we get a lot of stairs a lot of people point at the car a lot of people really enjoy the Mini Cooper and what it looks like and it makes me really happy to have one in the driveway so now that we've gone over the exterior let's go ahead and hop into the inside and show you guys what we picked for that so here's my Cameo for this video since this is mainly Tyler's car believe it or not in the two to three months of ownership I've actually only driven this once and I'm going to show you guys why so to get my seating position we'll just move this back a little bit I'll get in and as I mentioned in previous videos I'm about six one and the seat is all the way down but as you can see I am extremely Limited in terms of headspace this Center bar right here really limits my Headroom and this Pfizer really limits my headspace as well we are planning on removing this so hopefully this does give me a little bit more of Headroom but once I'm in here it's pretty nice but this and this the combination does make it very hard to look over my left shoulder which could be very dangerous when driving but overall I really really like the interior now I want to talk about some of the technology that is here on a Mini Cooper SE and then something that we unfortunately had to miss due to a chip shortage the first thing that we had to miss on was the heated steering wheel now it does come standard on our trimmer signature plus 2.0 that we have but we had to forgo that and the button would have been right here which I love these tunnel switches by the way they're so cool you can adjust the regen which is this switch on off traction control then also your mode buttons are right there too kind of wish that we would have been able to get the heated steering wheel because I'm always cold but that's right because at least I have heated seats in the winter time now for Tech I love the new screen that Minnie went with in 2022 which is this kind of digital LCD display this part itself is actually digital the center portion right here but this is digital with an analog needle which is really cool and then you can also see your status of your state of charge here for your battery and this is your power your EV range and then also if you're regening as well but this gives a pretty good wide range of information that I need and here on the turn signal stock that we have in the left hand side there's a button called BC for business control and you can actually sort through the bottom portion here right now in the winter time we're averaging about 3.4 miles to the kilowatt in the summertime at least the warmer months whenever we got in October and November I was averaging about 3.8 and that was not driving so nicely so pretty surprised with the efficiency here on Mini Cooper SE it actually is pretty efficient now here at about you know we have Let's see we have about 77 percent of battery it is really cold today it's 26 without the windshield technician to affect the wind and we're at about 76 miles which is pretty about average here in the winter time uh with other EVS that we've had in the past and it really is no big deal for us because there's plenty of level twos that we can charge at whenever we go shopping if we need to but I love this instrument display it's really nice now if you go for the iconic trim you would get a heads up display but I actually kind of like this display better what's really nice too is when you adjust the steering wheel it actually moves with the steering column itself so that's actually something that's super nice now here in the infotainment this is the 8.8 inch screen that you have here for mini it is either a touch screen or what's really nice is I kind of like the mini drive it's kind of like the iDrive and BMWs you have all your switches and knobs here to uh and all of your buttons to kind of control this as well I find myself actually utilizing the controls more than the actual touch screen itself probably because I'm used to BMWs in the past uh having to work for them for quite some time I'm just kind of used to how this infotainment works it does have apple carplay no Android auto the only thing is it is wireless and my phone is supposed to be connected to Apple wireless carplay and it's not showing up so that's something that it happens on occasion that I've noticed with all cars with Wireless Apple carplay you can connect it there actually is a USB down here you can connect it with down here on the bottom where you have your 12 volt as well you can connect it there for Apple carplay if I need to sometimes it works but most of the time it does work and it plugs in or if it doesn't I just listen to sirius because I pretty much know where I'm going most of the time in this vehicle now in terms of tech I like that you can actually turn that with a on off switch so if we turn that on you do have frontal Collision warning you have pedestrian warning up front and Lane departure warning you also do have rear cross traffic alert and if you put it into reverse here you do have parking sensors as well which show up here and you also have some guidance lines which move with the steering which is super nice another thing is whenever you get close to an object the ring will actually light up in that same color as your sensors which is super cool that's another thing too that I love about the mini is this ring so if you wanted to adjust say your temperature you could actually see it getting warmer and colder on the screen which is super cool it does the same thing with if you are if you have your directions in here with the mini navigation if you're changing the volume of something on your music or your podcast it'll also show up here too so it's kind of a neat little feature now I hope in the future I have seen for some of the future models that Minnie's coming out with this will turn into an entire display I do think this is kind of small for the vehicle but you know you can make do with with what it is I've made do with what it is but I would love to see this be a full touchscreen in your future models which I know midi is working on really cool to see that I haven't really used any of the saving functions here you have six save functions for various things I haven't set anything to that yet I just pretty much have everything on Apple carplay on my iPhone so I really have no need to utilize those buttons other than that the interior I really do like the vents they're really cool and I like the the circular ones you have here and kind of like the square ones they feel a little nice and another thing too that I found out is based on the type of drive mode that you have you can also change your ambient lighting so it'd be kind of hard to see we can get some night shots but you can change that throughout the day there are so many different colors which is so cool I love that many includes that tackle switch up here uh but yeah overall the interior is super nice unfortunately for Brandon like you saw this kind of gets in the way but for me I am really short so it's really easy for me to get in and out another thing too is we have had some people in the back seat only one time which is Brandon's parents they've been in the back seat of uh our Mini Cooper and we've only done a short trip with them we probably won't do any long trips with people in the back because it just there really is nothing in the back seat for people unless you're really smoke a small kid obviously like I said like we've had our dogs in here where the seats folded and there's plenty of room for them plenty of room for all of our trips the only thing too is there is limited Hardware space when the seats are up we can fit maybe four bags from Whole Foods in there if you want to add more space to your Mini Cooper you would have to fold the seats down I would love to see Mini Cooper do a four-door hardtop version of the SE be really nice to actually have a usable back seat for adults and anybody of any height and then also have a little bit more cargo space I know they're working on a future EV models like the aceman for example which I'm really excited about but for right now just really enjoying our Mini Cooper so now that we've talked about everything from the exterior the interior let's go ahead and talk about some driving Impressions that we have of our Mini Cooper SC okay so now we're gonna get into driving impressions of our Mini Cooper SC but first there's a sound that Brandon finds extremely annoying in this car it's the startup sound and it's not so much like I don't know it's just like the the chime that some vehicles have when they're at idle it does not stop especially if you're not like starting to drive it will just keep going and it drives me nuts okay that sound and now we're good to go but sometimes it will literally just keep going it will there's times where it will it doesn't really annoy me but it does annoy Brandon probably because our Tesla doesn't really make a whole lot of sounds no it starts up no I mean every vehicle has their things and yeah it's quirky and cute but the fact that it just keeps going yeah I'll just leave it at that so let's start driving impressions okay so now for driving impressions of our Mini Cooper SE so we primarily drive like I've mentioned in the city so we're just kind of used to streets like this park system for example and being a passenger in the mini is very nice I mean what's weird and I find this a lot with a lot of vehicles I actually have more headspace than the passenger seat than in the driver's seat not exactly for sure what that's about um but it is more comfortable for me to be in the passenger than it is to be in the driver's seat um there are still some times where this middle bar does impact my Headroom but overall it's a great place to be as a passenger depends on if you're doing your hair for the day or not uh yes yeah or if I have a hat too but I don't know I I like being a passenger in this car because I know Tyler enjoys driving it I do as a driver like I said the car itself is extremely engaging to drive so I'm used to a lot of like you know sports cars like Miatas and Mustangs and other fun to drive you know hatchbacks and station wagons so I'm used to a very dynamically driven vehicle and this definitely is one of that now it is winter time so I'm not going to push into some of the curves here or the turn returns that we have in our Park systems but during the warmer months I would do it all the time I would come to this park system of the national park and just have a blast drive in this and that's the thing is yeah this does have you know over about 200 pound feet of torque but it comes on so quick it actually jerks the steering wheel half the time it has quite a lot of torque sticker yeah I will say that that's one of my favorite things about the one time I've driven this is the amount of torque that goes right to the front wheels is very impressive and the car really handles well it's very balanced yeah the steering uh right now I'm in Comfort mode there is Sport I've had it in green it's also Green Plus which also turns off your climate control so I've really needed to save those last few miles which I have had to do one time I've had very very low range like one percent and I did have to put it into green plus it does limit your acceleration and the regen changes quite a bit too I do keep it in Max regen pretty much all the time now it hasn't snowed so when it does snow I'll probably switch it over into low regen instead of Max regen because it does do a really good job of stopping this car um it does have what I would consider one pedal driving pretty much for the most part there are times where I noticed if you are on incline facing downward the car kind of rocks a little bit or if you're facing up it also kind of rocks a little bit too but I still like the car it does do kind of like an auto hold ish feature if you're on a hill but if you're on a slight incline going down a decline going down there really isn't too much of an auto hold feature hopefully many improves that in the future it'd be kind of nice to actually have that on the whole feature like a lot of EVs do but this one doesn't in particular and as Tyler mentioned with regenerative braking the mini regen is really good um it's very strong uh even it at 100 state of charge the region still works very well and that's one thing that we do want to point out is because the battery is relatively on the smaller side there is a gap between the total capacity of the battery as well as total usable um you know or usable capacity for the battery pack so you can charge this to 100 and you won't see degradation like you might see in some electric vehicles right one thing that we've noticed too about the mini is there's no way to change the charge limit of the vehicle so when we plug it in whenever we're done for the day or whatever we're doing it just automatically plugs up to 100 which is fine because you know this is the same powertrain and platform essentially as the BMW i3 so BMW has really done their engineering and their Research into this battery pack it really doesn't bother us that we charge it to 100 and then do what we need to do I would say because of the low range we definitely do want to charge most of it to 100 that way we have all the range that we can you know we're here in the winter months so we don't have the you know 114 miles that it's ready for right now but even in this colder temperature we're still seeing impressive range so not only is this vehicle really fun to drive it also is really efficient too even with the 17 inch wheels and tires that we have on this vehicle and I wasn't sure how the ride quality was going to be because 16 is the sidewall in the 16 inch wheels are much thicker so probably would have been a little bit more comfortable but those cars actually pretty comfortable does have a short wheelbase obviously because it is a two-door hatchback so on some of the bigger bumps and potholes that we have here in Cleveland it definitely is kind of a bouncier ride but I also know the spring and shock setup is a little bit stiffer because because they do have the extra weight of the battery pack here in the Mini Cooper it is a little bit higher up than a gas version of this would be but you can still have all the many fun that you possibly want to have in this I kind of think that the electric version obviously is a lot better to drive it's a lot more engaging you have the power exactly when you want to have the power and the regen is really fun to just kind of let off the throttle and just regen down this hill for example now in this city I think you know for as small this vehicle is itself required than I think some are within its class of about thirty five thousand dollars it's really hard because there's not a whole lot of just two-door electrified competitors under 35 000 you look at the Nissan Leaf or the Chevy bolt are probably the two closest competitors to this vehicle we did look at those but they're not as engaging and fun to drive as this vehicle is and that's where my opinion differs slightly I mean especially since we owned a bolt for a few years I definitely think the bolt does have some engaging Dynamics but if you really are looking for a flat small compact vehicle definitely look at the mini but the only thing that really holds this vehicle back is the range um if it had just a little bit more range this vehicle definitely could be a more capable car but just for like everyday driving in my personal opinion the range is the biggest thing that holds this vehicle back definitely and I know Minnie is working on future iterations of these vehicles I really hope they improve that range at least 200 miles would be nice to see in a vehicle like this in Faster charging too we have charged this at evgo stations before um it is only 50 kilowatts so it really doesn't charge that fast but actually because the battery pack is small it's funny I feel like most of the time we look at it and it's been 25 30 minutes and the car is already at 80 90 and then we're ready to go you know if we if we need to go somewhere else but also on the Highway 2 we are on you know some of the Metro Park roads here but even on the highway the car is really compliant it's really easy the only thing I've noticed on the highway is because of how direct this steering is you have to make any little uh you know movements that you make of the wheel is really sharp so like you know if you're trying to make it Center then I feel like it does get a little Twitchy which is fine you know this is kind of like a fun to drive vehicle so I feel like any like little movements kind of move it around but I like just how direct it is and you know it's just it's a lot of fun to drive and that's kind of the primary thing that I really wanted of a second electric vehicles I really wanted that fun to drive factor and we have so many great roads here that you know we have so many great Park systems and side roads and highways and Scenic ways and it's just so cool to take this vehicle on those maybe one day I'll be able to drive it gotta move that sun visor first yes so now that we've had this for you know we're actually at almost about a thousand miles on this vehicle um I do not for one second regret getting this vehicle at all despite the range you know people will say oh 114 miles is not enough realistically if this is like your second car or even if you have small commutes this is perfectly fine you know for those situations this car is so easy to maneuver too I love the maneuverability of a any tight parking spaces or city streets it's really easy to kind of drive that around but I really for one minute I I don't I don't regret this purchase at all it was probably one of my favorite purchases we ever made it was really easy to do this purchase I loved the entire build process that mini has on their website you have your mini tracker kind of reminded us of like a Domino Pizza Tracker where you could see like uh oh there's a mini Wave by the way it's really cool but it was just so cool to like track the entire process of seeing our Mini Cooper being built and then like anticipating that day that we got to pick it up October yes yeah and it's been fun watching Tyler get so excited about this it's it's a vehicle that I'm still getting used to um you know it's it's a car that I obviously have not driven much you know I've mentioned that a few times throughout this video but as mentioned earlier it's a lot of fun to even just sit in here and just experience the driving Dynamics and see how excited Tyler is to have a mini because it is a lot of fun to have a Mini Cooper it is this I think now that you know still kind of in those honeymoon phases as you say of having a brand new car but we've had no issues with this vehicle at all now there's no wood to knock on in this car no um and I know many Coopers of the past especially the gas models have been extremely unreliable as they get older but I think with this powertrain it'll be perfectly fine um I am probably going to keep this until the next generation of Cooper Mini Cooper hardtops come out I really want to see a convertible electric car under forty thousand dollars that's what I really want to see yes yeah and while we're on the top of that mini did say that they are working on a convertible version of this for the next generation of Mini Cooper Electric so that's going to be super exciting and I really hope that we just start seeing different body styles of electrified Vehicles because it is really cool to have a two-door coupe hatchback that's electric I'm pretty sure Minnie's the only one on the market here in the United States that has something like this so it's very unique and of course put their new models they're gonna be able to stretch that and modulate their platforms for bigger vehicles like SUVs or four doors or your convertibles or another hard top like this so super excited about the new mini electrification plan that Minnie is coming up with and they're going to be doing for their future models uh and honestly can't wait to see more because this car has made me so excited I love driving this I make any excuse possible literally in the book to drive this over our Tesla I'm just happy to see Tyler happy me too well that's pretty much it for you know driving Impressions overall thoughts of our Mini Cooper SE and you know if you guys want us to do any in-depth videos with this vehicle or you have any specific questions about maybe a feature or how things work on this car let us know and we'll do a video on that we want to do as many videos as possible on the Mini Cooper Electric there are some out there but we would love to add more to the collection on YouTube definitely

23;Mini;2022 Mini Cooper SE;2022 MINI Electric (Cooper SE Facelift) Review - The best electric city car?;this is the mini electric a battery-powered mini now the car has only been introduced back in 2020 but mini has decided to give this car already a facelift now in this video i'm gonna take you through the interior and the exterior of the car i'm gonna show you everything that is new on this 2022 model keep in mind this is probably not the car you want to have if you're planning to do a lot of long distance traveling because of the range of this car however is this the best electric city car now let's find out in this video now before we start the video if you haven't already subscribed to the channel this is probably the best time to do it alright let's get started hey guys welcome back to the channel this is the mini electric the mini that is run by battery power this is the 2022 model so the brand new model it's the facelift model which is a little bit odd considering that the mini has only been on the market since 2020 but mini gave the regular petrol minis a facelift last year so while they were at it they also give the electric a facelift next year mini will release the all-new generation mini somewhere around in 2023 now that car will again be available with regular petrol engines and as a fully electric version just like this version now this is the current generation of the mini electric and i'd say this version is still pretty relevant it just received the facelifts now before we're going to discuss the updated interior and the specifications we're going to talk about the exterior design what is new here on the outside of the mini electric the mini electric always kind of looked the same like a regular mini cooper especially this facelift model only has a couple of subtle changes compared to the mini three doors with a petrol engine so let's discuss what's new here compared to the previous mini electric first of all there's a new bumper and there's a new grille now the grille now has the body color of the car which on this car is british racing green the fog lamps are now removed from the lower part of the bumper and are now integrated in the headlights that still have the round daylight running lights running all the way around it now instead of the fog lights you now get the sporty vertical air inlets on the side on the lower part of the bumper and there's also a pretty sporty lip here on the lower part of the bumper as well here on top you get led headlights as standard there's a little yellow s logo on this electric version and you also get a blacktop mini logo on this particular version as well and there's even a hood scoop which is not functional because you totally don't need it on an electric car but i have to admit it looks pretty cool not a lot of changes on the side of the car only a couple of things i want to mention for example the new turn signals that you got here on the side and they have a little bit of plastic cladding going around it and there's a yellow s logo again telling people that this is the fully electric version now the turn signals are now also fully led then let's talk about the wheels these are also new these are the tentacle spoke wheels 17-inch looking pretty classy with the black glossy finish and with the spoke design you also got some blacked out mirror caps on this particular version and some black door handles and looking again pretty classy combined with the blacked out wheels now the mini three doors is basically a coupe so you got these frameless windows here again looking pretty classy you also can get some tinted windows but you have to pay extra for that now there's something about this mini electric that i didn't know and that's the fact that this car is actually a bit higher than a regular mini now this car is definitely not a high car but it is in fact two centimeters higher than a regular mini now that is because this electric version has a battery pack which is obviously pretty heavy and they don't want this car to scrape on the ground when you go over speed bumps so they raise the car a little bit give it a little bit stiffer suspension and that's why this car is a little bit higher than a regular mini now they cleverly disguised that fact by giving this car a little bit more plastic cladding around the wheel arches so you'd probably never tell that this car is actually a little bit higher than a regular mini unless you park a regular mini next to this mini electric here on the back end there are a couple of subtle changes compared to the outgoing model you now get a new bumper with an integrated diffuser here on the lower part with some integrators and fog lights you still get the union jack tail lights you got these a standard just as the spoiler that you get as standard as well this particular version again you had the blacked out mini logo also the blacked out cooper logo now on the left side of the car you get a yellow badge a bright yellow batch that says e now together with the yellow s patch on the front it says s e which was originally the name for this mini electric i believe at mini they still call this the mini cooper se or the se cooper or something like that but you know everybody basically calls this the mini electric all right let's discuss cargo space now obviously this being a mini you don't have too much space here in the back there's 211 liters which is not much but it is definitely enough for your daily groceries there's also some underfloor storage here as well for your charging cables now if you really want to have a bit more storage space you have to fold down the rear seats that you can do in 60 40 configuration then you have 730 something liters which is actually pretty good for such a compact car now what is really clever here in the cargo space is the fact that you can tilt the back seats a little bit more forward so they have a different angle so you got a little bit more cargo space here in the back there's a little a metal plate that you can slide forward so the back seats will stay up straight now it does mean that it is basically impossible to seat on the back seats uh when they're a little bit more angled straight up but again you do get more cargo space so if you don't use the back seats or there's only like a small child there it's actually a very good solution [Music] now according to mini here in the interior they have used some better materials now i have to say honestly the interior well always felt quite premium in a mini and again it all feels very premium you got a lot of soft materials on the dashboards on the door panels here on the armrest it all feels basically like a mini bmw now obviously bmw is the owner of mini and you can really tell here in the interior it all feels well again really like you're driving a mini bmw take for example the toggle switches that are everywhere in this car not just down here but also here on top they're not made out of plastic they are made out of aluminium there's a lot of weight to them and they feel really good now let's quickly discuss the toggle switches because there are quite a lot of them the one here on top well one of them operates the panoramic roof which is a thousand euro extra or option rather and the other toggle switches are here to control like the reading lights the toggle switches down here some of them are also in the regular mini some of them are only in this fully electric version so take for example the toggle switch that controls the level of regen on this car this is an electric car so you can use the regenerative braking system on this electric car so if you let go of the accelerated pedal the car will automatically slow down using the electric motor to slow down the car you will actually win back some energy by doing so and it's just a very comfortable way of driving now there are two levels of regen on this car now when you start the car it will automatically be on the highest setting so if you let go of the accelerator pedal the car will break pretty firm using the electric motor but you can also put it on a lower setting if you prefer that now the infotainment screen and infotainment system that you get here in the center is basically the same system that you got in the previous model um which is not terrible but it is becoming a little bit outdated it doesn't run the newest bmw i drive eight system for example i believe this is still i drive six so yeah getting a bit outdated it's not like super laggy however you can notice that it is running a little bit slow now and then now behind the steering wheel you do get a very very cool looking digital gauge cluster you already had this one in the previous model as well and now you also get this one in regular mini models with a petrol engine it's a very nice screen to look at the graphics are very sharp and you can see all the information that you basically need you can also see the range on this car very clear which is sometimes a bit of an issue so let's talk range on this car now this car doesn't have the biggest battery pack and that is basically the biggest flaw of this car the battery pack is almost 33 kilowatt hours i believe 32.6 and giving it this car an official range of 234 kilometers now obviously in reality you can never make that you can always deduct at least 50 kilometers from the official range so let's say on a good day this car will do about 180 kilometers which is plenty for most people i mean i don't drive 180 kilometers every day rarely actually but still sometimes you want to drive a bit further and then oh you get some serious range anxiety in this car however this being a mini this being a city car it shouldn't be a problem for most people but you do have to keep in mind that this car doesn't have the greatest range it is a bit of a shame that they didn't offer a bigger battery in this car they didn't fill up the entire floor of the car with batteries i'm pretty sure on the next generation of the mini electric they will definitely give the car a better range now fast charging this car can do up to 50 kilowatts which is also not really fast you really need a half an hour to fill up the battery up to 80 and then you still have a range of around 140 150 kilometers if you're lucky so again the range is not the most impressive aspect of this car what is however impressive is the handling of this car this is one of the most fun electric cars you can drive and i'm even including cars like the poorest icon audi e-tron rs this is just a very zippy uh and fun driving car you know all minis are famous for their handling mini likes to call it the go-kart feeling like you're driving a go-kart and even in this electric version it's still a very fun car to drive you know the car is a little bit higher up but the battery pack actually and makes sure that this car has a lower center of gravity making this car maybe even more fun to drive than let's say a cooper s maybe even a junk cooper works no probably not that one but i think it is more fun to drive than a cooper as you got the instant torque of the electric motor that's 270 newton meters of torque 184 horsepower so just around the same uh amount of horsepower as you get in a cooper s but you do get that instant torque which really propels this car uh makes this car leap forward really fast the car will do zero to 100 kilometers an hour or zero to 62 miles an hour in 7.3 seconds uh but it is the zero to 60 kilometers an hour time that really is impressive it's 3.9 seconds and it even feels more impressive than that number honestly when you hit the accelerated pedal on this car it really goes flying making this car a lot of fun to drive and also in the corners this car handles really well so all in all i think this is a perfect electric city car you got plenty of range for the city uh if you go outside of the city you do have to consider the range but you can have a lot of fun outside of the city with this car so those are my impressions of the 2022 mini electric if you like this video don't forget to hit that like button and if you want to see more videos like this in the future and don't forget to hit that subscribe button and i'll see you at the next one [Music] you
24;Mini;2022 Mini Cooper SE;2022 MINI Cooper SE Electric: I dont think Ive ever been this ANXIOUS.;let's go oh yeah instant talk baby oh yeah oh [Applause] oh i have never been more anxious in my entire life than today you see behind me is the mini cooper se it's a pretty cool full ev hatchback that gets about kilometers of range now that makes sense in a country like france where you're in paris you need a small little ev 160 k's will take you to the the mullen rouge and back but here in australia i can't get to the bloody shops without running out of range and then worrying am i going to get home in fact i've come to bmw which is actually the closest ev charger to my home and i live in like central melbourne i've driven 20 minutes the car's on 60 battery and i'd like i'm worried i won't make it home and it's going to take hours to charge the charging network in australia sucks i'm going to insert a clip here so you can see what it's been like for me so jacob what's it like uh trying to charge up a car in australia we're not hold for 25 minutes been on hold for 25 minutes i got places to be man people to see you got things to do i got things to do man and my nose is huge but we're not here to talk about that we're here to talk about this the mini cooper se some market or actually only the uk cause of the mini cooper electric like it's a pretty cool car i'm gonna take you all around it we'll show you the exterior the interior what it's like to drive some people call this a true hot hatch i will give you my opinion on that we're also going to launch it using my specialist timing here and then i'll end on should you buy a mini cooper s e or a mini cooper se multi-tone roof as this trim is called bit weird all right let's get straight into it now before we get into the review i'm actually going to explain why we're filming it like this no joke this really is like the closest charger to my home it's at the bmw headquarters which is pretty convenient because i get free charging the annoying thing is that one of the chargers the mini one doesn't work uh so we've had to use the bmw we spent like 25 minutes on the phone it was absolutely ridiculous so the car's gonna be framed like this for a while it just has to be because otherwise i'm not getting home now one of the main reasons you're going to spend 70 000 australian dollars on a mini cooper se is because of its looks it is a very good looking car there is no doubt about that very very stylish don't know how i feel about this ombre roof with its blue and blue and black look it's a bit extra for me but i can understand why some people would get it so what do you get as standard where you get full led lights they are super duper bright and they look really cool too uh mini badge here you've got fake hood scoop here because guess what underneath here there is a real engine not let me show you so in most electric cars you would find storage under here at least most normal electric cars but never the bmw's it seems because there is no storage space under here i'm pretty sure you've got your you know your motor at the front and whatever but yeah what ah you're not gonna fit your suitcase in there my friends ow oh it's actually kind of cool i like that electric can't electrocute myself bro electricity can't electrocute electricity am i right what's different about this from any other mini cooper well it's the frontier you can see a lot of it is blocked up for aerodynamic purposes you don't need to call any engine so you block it up makes it more aero makes sense and as you can see here there is the s badge here this is the se so i guess it's got comparable performance to a standard cooper s you're just spending like 30 grand more but who cares right no difference coming to the rest of the side you've got these optional tentacle wheels here they call them and they do look pretty cool i like how they're blacked out they're 17 inches and they're wrapped in pirelli cintaratos never heard of them in my life but you probably have blacked out mirror caps here it's pretty uh bougie you've also got oh look at that door handles but they do have kayla center and go of course this is the mini yours trim which is like top of the range trim as i said this is the mini cooper se miniors multi-tone roof that is literally the name of the trim and uh yeah it's a coupe by the way so it does have frameless windows here and it's pretty damn cool i'll admit again i'm sorry about the framing of these shots uh as i said we were really on the phone for like 25 30 minutes just to find out that one of the charges uh wasn't working so we have to keep it in this position it's going to look a little bit weird but whatever it's still it works okay it works so at the back we have these really cool union jack tail lights i like them a lot they look really sick and you can buy them together it makes the full uh uk flag go to the uk we've also got a roof spoiler here we've got blacked out badging i really like this this is the electric badge so that you know that this is the ev but otherwise it's a very good looking car i don't know though if it's you know if you should buy one of these just because of its looks as i said this thing is 70 000 you could spend quite a bit less maybe like seven grand or something and get yourself a rear-wheel drive tesla model three and then you're getting about two and a half times the range a bit more practicality and reliability is gonna be the same because they're electric cars anyway so i don't know it's a bit of a tough sell but let me know in the comment section down below what do you think about the the looks of this car it's a very good looking car but would that pull you over the edge over a tesla model 3 i'm unconvinced let's talk about the interior so what's the interior like well it's pretty awesome and it's one of the reasons that you would actually buy the mini cooper se and it's because you get a pretty premium luxury special interior so there are things to like but things not to like let's start with the things i like first of all soft touch absolutely everywhere it feels super duper premium in here and it feels like a million bucks like seriously on the on par of bmw of course who own mini but uh yeah you can see where the inspiration came from you've got some cool touches here like some toggle switches down here some of them do ev stuff over a standard mini as you would expect this one here is for your regen and this one here is for changing your sport mode or into green or green plus where it turns off your air conditioning and i have been doing that to save range that's how much range anxiety i've got in this car uh but you've also got some other toddler switches up here which change the lighting things like that and it's just a really sleek cool layout i like it a lot what's not to like is that you're using a older infotainment display or older infotainment system kind of like the bmw idrive 6 system they're now up to eight which means it's fine um it's a bit laggy you still get like a i drive e controller down here it's almost the same not quite as ergonomic as before but it's a fine system you do get wireless apple carplay though though no wireless android auto so if you have an android phone you're not bougie enough to have a mini sorry you've also got a storage area here it's not really a storage area actually it's just your wireless charger which would be great but if you have any sort of flagship phone like for me i've got the iphone max 13 whatever if i try and put it in there just no chance in hell it's an older system they had in like the bmw x2 in fact they still have it in the bmw x2 i mean at least you get a wireless charger but you're gonna have a pretty small phone to get it in there and then you've got no storage though it does lift up you've got storage space there couple of cupholders look i've got my obligatory water bottle fits a couple of cup holders in there absolutely fine you've got a storage area up front for your phone a usb c port a usb a port and look a little 12 volt socket so plenty of io as they call it let's put that down there and there you go then here we have a glove box which is a pretty decent size like that a lot the dorbians are tiny really really small you're not getting a water bottle in there now as i said this is the mini yours trim which means that it's premium and you do get these awesome seats here they call them lounge seats they've got the union jack in the headrest they look really cool and they feel super duper comfy again really premium would be a lot more premium than the seats that you get for example in a base model tesla model 3 so i guess that's a good thing you've also got a harman kardon sound system which does sound it's very good up in front of you you get a digital instrument cluster it's pretty average and also it's on an angle in every single mini and it does my head in it's like slightly tilted to the left which is a bit annoying for someone like me who notices those kinds of things but it does have a pretty cool layout ev specific of course up front you get a heads up display which is really annoying because if you have the steering wheel in the wrong position for example i usually like to have my steering wheels a bit higher then all of a sudden i can't actually see the heads-up display so that kind of sucks speaking of steering wheel it is a very nice steering wheel it's uh one of the i guess older style bmw steering wheels but nothing wrong with that it feels super nice to hold on to on the hands you do have buttons to control a lot of things but they feel plasticky and pretty horrible to be totally honest with you and also everything in here is a circle and i mean everything from the air vents to the door handles to the speaker housing to this infotainment display which i didn't mention actually has lighting and it's dynamic lighting so for example if i change the temperature it like moves around it's kind of cool i don't know oh it's a lot of beeps and oh anyway what's it like in the back seats let's go let's talk about that now even though this is a sleek two-door you do get back seats so to get into them you reach around you grab that slide the seat forward just did leg day and i'm in a lot of pain oh my gosh oh my gosh it's not it's not it's not the difficulty of getting in the back it's just my legs being poop so once you're back here the seats are super duper comfy we can slide this back god damn it jacob why do you have your seat so far back can you just pull the seat forward so if the person in the front seat makes compromises you can have people sit in the back although it's you know you will have to make compromises but it is very very comfy back here i'll give you that you get two seats back here which is kind of enough no no in all seriousness it's actually pretty damn good back here i i wouldn't mind sitting back here but the front person might mind because their legs are going to be on the dash so it is what it is fam let's talk about practicality now the mini is not just mini in name it is mini in size thankfully the ev doesn't actually lose any internal space because the battery's so small so maybe that's a win there i guess but yeah it doesn't have much space regardless so you might be able to fit a full suitcase in there and that's about it you do get underfloor storage and that's where your charging cables live this one is your like home emergency trickle charger the other one here is when you're out and about and you have access to faster charging options yeah it's not a huge amount of space but you can put down the back seats using these fun little plugs here if i'm if i'm tugging if i'm yanking on your chain and then yeah you get plenty of space if you do that so while we were just filming the b-roll then i just saw this really cool feature so yes if you put it like that the seats are all the way back you're not going to fit a full suitcase in there i don't think it'd be real struggle but you can lift up this tab here pull it back means the back seat people aren't going to be having a great time but it means you get quite a lot more room in the back so that's pretty cool spec time now of course this doesn't have an engine but we'll still pop the hood anyway under here is a fake cover as we showed earlier but it doesn't really matter it does have a pretty awesome setup it actually comes from the bmw i3 the old outdated but amazingly weird bmw that i never have driven but i wish i had you've driven it yeah where my test drive really yeah oh how was it yeah really cool everything was very sustainable very stable so it's powered by a 32.6 kilowatt hour battery that's about half of the size that you'll find in most other evs now at least full evs so 135 kilowatt of power 270 newton meters of torque that's actually quite a lot of course this thing does weigh a little bit more than a standard mini because of the batteries and whatnot so you get about the same performance as a mini cooper s but that doesn't mean it's a slouch it's actually quite quick especially when you consider things like instant torque but we'll come back to that in a moment now charging is a pretty average story i guess it's kind of similar to pretty much every other ev on the market at least offered from bmw at the moment so you have an ac charge current at max 11 kilowatt if you use dc charging it's 50 kilowatt although in australia it's so hard to find a dc charge as i said there is none around my house this is the fastest i can find so we're doing 11 kilowatt hour charging we came here at 60 battery and now it's been no joke about an hour what are we at we're at 70 so yeah it's not the quickest out there if you're gonna be charging this you're going to be charging this at home and if you do so you can use a it comes with a like an emergency charger that you can plug into your home but really bmw sorry mini wants you to install a wall box in your home to plug it up and charge it up okay so now we're going to launch the mini cooper se it's not entirely fair because we're both sitting in the car but many do claim that this will do 000 in about 7.1 seconds but what will it actually do we're actually in a slight decline here so that should kind of balance out the fact that we're both pork chops what's your guess i guess that's a good question i think i think we'll do it in 7.4 seconds i think 7.98 ooh oddly specific all right let's go hey foot on the break no well i don't even know why let's go oh yeah instant talk baby oh yeah oh oh oh that's better yeah i just took that took me a second 0-100 in 7.05 seconds i'll take that man that's pretty good slight decline but heavy boys all right let's get into how this thing drives when you're not being an idiot by the way bro that's a nice hoodie you're wearing thanks man i actually got it from a really cool store called matt brand cars we don't even know we don't know the name of the website what's the website i'll put it up here now all right so here we are driving the i was about to say bmw the mini i'm so tired bro freudian all right it happens to the best of half of the best of us the mini cooper s e s for s e for electric i've got the windows down by the way because i'm too scared to do it on the air con because we're in the country i don't know if we'll make it home but let's give this thing some source oh sprightly it's decent but it slows down once it gets to about a hundred so this thing is electronically limited to 150 kilometers an hour not that you'll i could ever be going 150 kilometers an hour in this thing unless you're on the autobahn but you'll run out of range pretty damn quick if you do that maybe it's too loud okay i'm gonna risk it for the biscuit so actually my range just dropped four kilometers so i guess that's all right we just drove out here like for the car was at 90 we're now at 75 we've been driving for maybe 20 minutes and i've been driving in green mode i put the car in green to make the car more efficient and so no joke this car has just given me a lot of range anxiety that i haven't experienced in other evs because i've got 450 60 kilometers of range like this is always ever present in my mind like will i make it home can you tell by the way the review's going yeah but let's talk about how it drives otherwise so when you're just cruising along the highway you have fixed dampers which means that they're not adaptive but it's actually pretty damn comfortable definitely on the sporty side yeah but it's good the steering itself is pretty heavy no matter what mode you're in when you put it into sport mode that means it does add quite a lot of weight to the steering wheel but in a good way and i'll show you what i mean when we get to saucy corner this is actually the original saucy corner you haven't seen it yet no we go to saucy quarter too usually saucy cherry popping the saucy cherry no joke i'm filming back in the old location which i don't like as much because there's you know more traffic but that's because this wouldn't make it no joke to where we were filming where we usually film you make it one way it make it one way wouldn't make it back so that kind of sucks but anyway i'm going on about the range but that's because that's kind of the biggest drawback of this car yeah in terms of power though you put your foot down it goes it really does go it's a very quick car so let's put the car into there's three modes sport mid and green there's also a green plus which turns off air con it's pretty funny let's put the car into sport mode literally has a go-kart for its icon and the range dropped it did just drop it just knows it pre-empts yeah it's just so surreal oh yeah that we're going quite quick and all you can hear is the chair kind of creaking yeah i know which is a good thing actually because it's very quiet within here you can thank the fact that this does kind of have like luxury car underpinnings and you've also got nice soft materials everywhere that helps to soak up a lot of the road noise and when you put it into sport mode the accelerator just goes like one to one meaning like you put your foot down a little bit and like it just goes this thing handles pretty amazingly well you'll see a lot of reviewers not actually taking this thing on the twisties because they can't make it out there and really that's not what this car is for let me tell you it's pretty fun on the twisties wow it's very flat as well you can thank the battery for that because in the floor so you know this car's center of gravity is really low lower than any other mini but let me slow down here to give a bit of space between me and the car in front and there's a few twisties here so it's pretty amazing the wheels don't scrabble i'm not sure if there's a diff like a limited slip diff between them but i wouldn't be surprised because it puts down power really well like it's genuinely very impressive how this thing drives and we did the m240i recently and that was amazing but this the fact that this still feels good compared to that yeah that's true yeah we literally just came out of that yeah swapped it over hats off mini bmw really no that's not fair i'm sure they have like mini specific but you know they had a meeting about it they had they had a corporate meeting about it we know that much zoom chat yeah oh this is saucy corner we're coming up just as you go on a friend it's time so we gotta come to a start this saucy corner isn't quite as good as last order so four second but it's just yeah it's a it's a corner of source right you ready all right here we go this is the first corner oh oh oh i felt the back come around there a little bit yeah under and over it was a bit of under an oversteer that was quite weird look this thing is actually quite a lot of fun to drive it's holding that line really well that's impressive wow that is impressive okay all right all right i i think i get it i think i get this car coming it's like when are you going to be out here though yeah well you're not because you're going to be scared to get home it's really good though i think i think i've figured this car out though to me this car is the perfect city car it's the it's the car you have when you're in like paris right it's when you want to go to point a point b shops in style in comfort it is quite comfortable it's just that range it really it really ruins it for me you know like 180 kilometers on a good day i don't know man i've been driving this car pretty civil and in green mode most of the time not right now not right now though and you know like it's i don't know handling is very good though it does it does i know it's so cliche it's disgustingly cliche but it does handle like it's on rails people call it a hot hatch and again i want to reiterate that that is ridiculous it doesn't have the emotion of a hot hatch i don't feel like i'm you know like this fighting with the car yeah or like doing much it's almost like on easy mode because it handles so well thanks to the battery being low um the regen braking is what's stopping me there i i have not put my foot on the brake once because the regen is is really good i don't know man i'm in two minds i'm in two mines this car is good very very good drives amazingly well but you don't get to drive it for very long and there's a lot of anxiety with it i'm now down to 98 kilometers like that probably two kilometers there and back is just because of the way we were driving it's used about 15 k's of range yeah that's not awesome and now this chair creaking is starting to annoy me all right let's get into my final thoughts all right so what are my final thoughts on the mini cooper sc i think early on in my career i made the mistake of being like i don't like it because it's got these floors therefore no one will like it there is definitely a market for this car it is just for people who are doing you know short trips you can't go for example an hour out of melbourne you won't make it home i'm not even joking like there's like there'll be nowhere to charge you're not going to make it home so this is the kind of car that if you live in a small area and you want to go ev you want a really good looking car and you're happy to spend the money it's kind of perfect for that but for me i would just go and buy myself a tesla model 3. personally that's just me but let me know what you guys think of the mini cooper s e would you buy one would you spend the 70 grand to get yourself the mini cooper s e mini yours [Applause] multi-tone roof as this one is called let me know in the comment section just below that like button thank you guys very much for watching and as always i don't know why i did that i'll see you next week ciao for now
25;Mini;2022 Mini Cooper SE;Was Buying The Shortest Range EV A Good Idea? MINI Cooper SE 6 Month Ownership Update;this episode of out of spec reviews is brought to you by magna more on that later hello and welcome to another out of spec review my name is mike if you listen to and or watch our out of spec motoring podcast then you will recognize me this is the first video that i'm filming for out of spec and the reason for that is this car right here behind me that is my 2022 mini cooper sc i've owned it for about six months now so it's gonna be a six month uh owners review and i'm mainly setting out to answer do i regret buying this car which is the shortest range ev on sale uh six months into ownership so let's go find out and here it is my 2022 mini cooper s e the fully electric mini and also the shortest range ev on the market with just an epa estimated 112 miles of range just look at it uh this color is called british racing green uh i remember seeing this color on the 60th anniversary uh mini which i think came out in 2019 is when they first launched this color super happy that they kept it around for me to be able to order it so this trim that i got is a signature plus trim in the mini world that would make this the mid trim spec it starts with a signature at twenty nine thousand nine hundred dollars and then the signature plus which i believe after destination fee is a little more than thirty four thousand i think it's like thirty four thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars which would make sense because mine stickered for thirty five thousand dollars on the nose because i got one optional extra everything else was free or free included in your thirty five thousand dollars i should say so this green registration green just looks absolutely amazing in the sun really highlights the body lines of this car absolutely love the metallic in it super eye-catching i get a ton of compliments on this thing everyone loves the color and the two-tone look i specifically avoided a green roof and went with the white roof as many should be i think mini should have white roofs they just look amazing and i think the most amazing thing of this car is my one optional extra the roof rails i remember when i had my last mini which i also ordered new from the factory that car did not have roof rails and ben and kyle both gave me an extremely hard time for not ordering roof rails so i was sure to not let them down again and made sure that i got the roof rails before i even told them that i had ordered the car officially the wheels that i chose are not the power spoke wheels aka corona wheels from back in 2020 these wheels are called pedal spoke wheels i've actually not seen another sc with these wheels on them yet so kind of makes mine a little more unique i think and for 2022 the car was updated with this new front end which looks so much better than the old one in my opinion i love this body colored grill really really sets it off i absolutely love the green how it fits in with the chrome and the black accents for the signature plus the only difference really between the signature clutch and iconic the iconic trim is the most expensive mini that you could buy uh it does get the blacked out trim on the outside so all this chrome here all the chrome around the taillights back here will be black i do kind of wish i had the black trim or at least they made it optional but i guess they had to differentiate the car somehow and of course like all minis it has the union jack tail lights i know that these are kind of divisive amongst a lot of people i really love them no is no complaints from me and really the only way you can tell that this car is an electric car is this badge this uh mini electrified badge and the cooper s here the s's on this car are in like this yellow green color uh very cool this is the charge port as you can see it has the same symbol click it open up and as you can see yes this mini has dc fast charging uh excuse the cleanliness of my charge port it is pollen season here and now i realize where it's all gone whenever i wash the car so that's kind of interesting but anyway let's get these back in here and shut that you join me back at the office with these incredible views to thank magna now magna is a technology company that produces not only parts for cars but also technological solutions from manufacturing and design and engineering they cover so many parts of the automotive sector and i bet you've interacted with a magna product in your life before magna actually is very near and dear to my heart because their partnership magnustya in austria produced my first car a mini countryman and it was built right there in gratz a lot of you are also familiar magna is going to be producing the fiskar ocean in their magnustyre factory and they also build g-wagons and nothing gets tougher than a g so really excited about our partnership with magna of course they are also hiring for engineers so we know a lot of you guys are super interested in technology and automotive i'll leave a link below so you can learn more about possible opportunities at magna but of course we want to thank them for sponsoring today's video and being such a huge supporter of out of spec truly they are pushing mobility forwards responsibly and sustainably so that's just a really quick overview of my mini the one that i decided to order um as i ordered it um really again really love this color super happy with it on the outside and almost more happy on the inside i mean just look at those seats talk about like tweed british jackets like that just works absolutely love this leatherette cloth combination with i'm going to use a porsche term here deviated stitching included didn't have to pay extra for that porsche i think charges you like 600 to do that overall super happy with the quality of this car too i have zero squeaks and rattles the sunroof is super solid the seats don't squeak at all unlike ben's ticon overall just a really really great car i'm super happy with it let's shut the door next we're just going to hop back inside and i'm really just going to attempt to answer my question do i regret buying this little thing i don't think the answer will surprise you okay so back to the original question i posed do i regret buying the mini cooper se and the simple answer is no i have no regrets at all i absolutely love this little car it's stupid fun to drive you can zip around everywhere it feels plenty fast it feels a lot faster than my old mini cooper s just because most electric cars do due to instant torque as we know i just think the value for this car is where it's at so 35 000 plus a full 7 500 tax refund from the federal government if you live in a state where you get state incentives this car is even cheaper unfortunately north carolina doesn't offer any state incentives which is a miss on their part i think they should i think all states should but regardless this is still a very low level of ev ownership to get into and like i said earlier if you can charge at home every night then you certainly should never worry about the range on this car i don't even charge every night like i said i charge once a week if that and i just think for the driving experience for an ev it drives exceptionally well it drives just like a standard mini cooper and those are the standard ice mini coopers are so fun to drive whether you get the three cylinder or the four cylinder turbos no regrets at all love this little car i think when the day comes right do you end up selling it i'm going to miss it just like i missed my 2017 mini but there you go i highly recommend if you are in the market for an affordable fun to drive well-built comfortable ev then you definitely need to shortlist this mini the mini cooper sc highly recommend it and i will see you all next time you
26;Mini;2022 Mini Cooper SE;New Mini Electric Cooper SE 2022 Review;[Music] hey guys welcome back to a new video i guess this week is the week of electric mini city cars and today i have with me the mini cooper s i electric and in this video i will make the full review interior exterior i will try to show you every single detail about this mini cooper si and yeah of course in the end i will give you the conclusion before we go forward and start the review i want to give you some technical data i want to tell you that i'm right here at auto fake here in switzerland in burn i will leave the link in the description if you are around switzerland check them out guys they have great price also tell them you see my video you come from me and you will get a nice discount as i said mini cooper s i free doors also the car come with a few few extra options that you can see it right here for example the comfort plus package 900 francs navigation connect plus 900 francs it comes also with the driving assistant plus 1 600 extra piano black exterior you will see in a moment when we go outside i will show you also and you can see the exterior design look phenomenal in this color with the black glossy it's a great combination 400 extra i think you totally deserve classic trim i'm not sure what it's about here 1000 francs and all those options together will cost you 4 800 francs normally the starting price is 37 900 francs and with all these options the price will go to 42 700 francs this is the price of the car a little bit bigger but yeah if you are on the market for a sporty mini city car uh electric this might be one for you in my opinion it has the best driving feeling from all the cars in this class because it bring that bmw feeling on the steering on the ground it's just super super sporty now going forward another cool uh interesting information is that the car come with 1560 kilograms also 15.8 kilowatt hour is the consumption and it's in a class efficient class of course now let me give you some deeper technical details and let me tell you that the power of the car it's a front wheel drive so the motor it's in the front it comes with 184 horsepower 270 newton meters it's more than enough it's one of the most powerful mini electric car in this class and it's really really powerful check out the test drive i will have a separate video with it with the test drive there i talk a little bit more about the driving feeling also the car comes with a one-speed automatic transmission like all electric cars not all almost all electric cars because some of them they have dual transmission and that's also super sporty and very expensive cars but most of them come with one speed automatic transmission the boot trunk capacity 211 liters if you fall down the seats completely 731 liters also the maximum speed of the car 150 kilometer per hour zero to 107.3 seconds the performance of the car are very very good the car it's also created special for sporty driving so that's why i tell you in my opinion is the best sporty car in this class now another important thing is that the battery it's 32.6 kilowatt hour but the usable battery capacity is 28.9 kilowatt hour it's a 350 volt a lithium battery also the range of the car vltp estimated 234 kilometers the turning radius of the car 10.7 meters also the car come with independent multi-link suspension on the rear and also independent spring strut mech person suspension on the front ventilated brake discs on the front and break this on the rear also the car that i have with me it comes with 17-inch rims that are fit super nice on the car and they look just perfectly now those are the most important information also i will add some information as we go in the video guys let's start the review exterior interior and in the end we will make the conclusion all right guys let's start the review here is the key of the car very interesting key kind of unique i should say what you can do with the key you can lock and unlock the car uh and also unlock the trunk nothing crazy nothing special it's just a simple key as you can see from here also uh the car come with keyless entrance it has a little little button right here and when you press it you can lock the car and unlock the car that's something to keep in mind other than that you can see the quality of the doors guys because the door come with frameless window the same as honda e and also stezla model freecom you can hear when you when you close the doors you can see that the window will go a little bit upper and today it's winter it's very cold outside and sometimes the window will stay stuck when outside it's very very cold and ice so you have to pay attention what you should do it's here on those rubbers you you should put some kind of special cream for the winter and in this way it will not get frosty in the winter time that's that's a tip for you guys other than that what i notice is that they put a lot of quality here a lot of rubbers around here and here so uh we will see also in the test drive video how is the the sound insulation but overall it is quite good quality and also when you close the door you can hear that that quality uh made by a bmw car i should say anyway this is with the key let me turn on the lights and then we will talk a little bit about the exterior design all right guys now the exterior design of the car it's like a minute still keep that shape of mini cooper uh i like it very much for the city it has kind of this the perfect shape and the perfect size and the fact that it's a little bit square as you can see here in the back it's allow you to have even more space for the back passengers and we will see in a moment when we go inside uh but in terms of design it's quite beautiful i like the design i like that they use those 17-inch rims on the car i think they fit perfectly they look really really good in this shape in this size i just love them also the car come with the ventilated brake this on the front i think you can see it right there also the the discs are a little bit rusty here in the back we have only brake discs so no drum drums or stuff like that they're a little bit rusty because as you know most of the cars electric cars they're not braking with the disc they are braking with the motor it has this regenerative brake so that make the discs last a little bit longer but anyway overall those 17-inch rims look just perfect with the car stand out a little bit make it look sportier and make it look aggressive i should say and nicer i think not only the girls can drive this car like i heard a lot of people even boys and boys and men can drive this car because it looks good it looks aggressive it looks nice it has beautiful shapes even if you look from the front it's it's it's quite quite nice i don't know about you but i like the way they design it really nice shape also this gray color it's beautiful i see that bmw use it also on the other cars like the new m2 i see the same color this gray look just gorgeous gorgeous on the car guys and also it's in two colors you can see that the roof it's black and also the a pillar down here it comes this beautiful gray beautiful round shapes here in the front even the hood you can see how nice shape it has also they add this fake vent element here that make the car much more aggressive the mini logo it's nice in black you can see it really beautiful this black combination with gray even the glossy glossy black plastic around the head lamps on the grill here we have again this glossy black plastic pretty pretty nice and clean design in the front we have some air intakes to allow the air to cool down different parts there down here the same now they are closed we have some clappers that are closed right now but they will open in the hot weather so it allows more air to go inside to pull down different parts there down here also the bumper it's quite sporty uh and nice we have some air intakes here on the side so you can see that the air come inside here and then go outside around the wheel right here so it's quite nice in my opinion it looks really really good also on the both sides the same story aggressive beautiful looking car now here guys on the tail lights uh you can see that we have full led the high beam the low beam led the turning signals led and also the daylights it's in the same place with the turning signals also led light and uh it looks quite quite nice really nice also the s right here from cooper s and this is the s i because it's electric it's it's at the eye also on the on the name going here uh also you can see this chrome design the way they add it around the car it's really interesting this is all over around the car we have this chrome kind of signature nice design uh it makes the car stand out a little bit more then here on the windshield we have a camera and sensors for raining and light the camera for reading the traffic speed limit also helps with the lane assist other than that here on the boat side we have the turning signals on the body of the car you have also again this s that looks wonderful and some black glossy element with some matte plastic quite nice the mirror are also in black the same as the roof they are quite big so you have a good visibility even though the car doesn't come with blind spot technology the mirrors are relatively big so you have a good visibility also the windows are big so you don't have to worry in terms of visibility the handles they also design it in black glossy so it will kind of stand out on the body of the car also another cool thing that i like they did on the car is that they add this plastic mat all over around the car you can see on the downskirt you can see here in the front where a lot of stones occur so everywhere around the wheels of the car we have this plastic that means the car is protected the paint and the body of the car is protected from scratch stones whatever it's happening in the city most of the time a lot of scratches occur in this area so you don't have to repaint the car just change those plastics it's much faster and nicer six sensors in the front i like that not many small cars have six sensors parking sensors and all that um sensors that help the car then in the back also four parking sensors not six they didn't have space where to put them so there are only four parking sensors on the rear here we have the fog lamps normal bolt light on the fog lamps also the down part of the bumper in the back look nice look sporty on the upper side we have cooper s again led light here the taillights quite nice even the blinkers on the both sides you can see it also from the distance it looks really good here we have a reverse camera also led lights on the number plate again this mini logo and up here the roof spoiler again quite sporty uh and nice i like the way it looks i like the way it stand out a little bit in the back the radio antenna is something that i wish to be different it's kind of big i don't know why they didn't add it some kind of a small glossy plastic but other than that it's relatively fine also i think the car would look much better with some tinted windows here on the rear yeah anyway those are small details here is the charging port on the right side so you can charge the car at dc and ac and also the maximum charging speed is 49 kilowatt hour in dc this is it guys this is the exterior of the car i don't know if i missed something i think i cover almost everything it's a small beautiful sporty car and and in my opinion this is the best sporty car in this super mini class this is my opinion the best sporty car in terms of driving feeling check out the test drive guys there i talk a little bit more about the driving feeling and you will see a little bit more uh why i'm telling you this is the best sporty car in this class it's it's really bring that bmw feeling to the car that crazy sporty that you are close to the ground anyway check out the test drive even the hood is designed in a bmw way so you don't have to find something here or get dirty on your hand you just pull it up like that you have an automatic liftgate in the front here another good uh quality feature that the car come with it's a front wheel drive so the motor is in the front that's something to keep in mind here we have a big plastic with mini logo on it nothing nothing to see here uh also we have the fluid cooling fluid there is the 12 volt battery and here is the liquid for the wipers anyway that's it guys going in the trunk open the trunk from here it's a manual lift gate in the trunk and here is the trunk now the car come also with this uh protection right here small protection i will take it out and i will show you how it looks without it this is the trunk here at the beginning we have some plastic guys also the great thing is that this floor can be adjusted you can leave it like this you have like five centimeter here maybe seven centimeter or you can take it out and put it uh straight let me show you it's quite hard to do that with one hand put it here and you have a flat floor you have a completely completely flat floor and this is this is awesome this is a great feature down here the the other cool feature is that you can put this protection just like that it has a plastic here that hold it in place and now you can see that you can you have even more space down here it's really really deep i like that also you have the cables that come standard with the car to charge it at home or to charge it with ac at public charging stations you have some hooks in the corners that also good and other than that this is the space relatively good i find it uh very useful and also this floor here i find it's super super useful and you have a lot of space there you can also adjust it down the way you want it also the car let's don't forget that comes with a 12 volt board right here normal light here uh normal halogen light and yeah other than that this is the trunk let me take out the protection and then we will fall down the seats all right guys i just take out that protection so you can take a look one more time the entrance in the trunk it's huge it's relatively huge i like the way they design it also you have a flat floor here and that's a good thing now if you want to fall down the seats all you have to do is just pull these levers here on the side just like that and then push it forward then you will have a flat floor a completely flat floor this is again another cool practical feature i like the way it looks i think you can fit inside here a lot of stuff for the size of the car it's it's relatively perfect nothing to say about that also uh the great thing is that you can even put the floor a little bit down so if you need more space it's great that you can adjust it or you can actually take it out completely so that's that's also another cool thing let me put it down to show you how it would look also with it down just like that so you will have some kind of extra 10 centimeters there uh if you will put it down so yeah relatively nice also if you go on the side let me go here on the side let me show you if you want to fold this seat down you have a handle up here in the back and then just push it forward and then you can check out one more time the space from here you can see the entrance it's it's huge and then the great part you have a flat floor and also it left behind the seats some storage space there where you can put different different stuff the quality behind the seats here is very very good anyway this is the space guys um i hope you make an idea now i will put everything back and then we will go inside the car to see the other space and the technology okay before we go forward i forget to tell you that up here on the door you have the triangle so yeah also handle to close the um the trunk anyway let's go here forward the entrance here you have a huge door it's it's perfect and also the entrance behind this front seat it's very big so you can go inside there in the back without any problem now here is the handle this is how easy you can fold it forward now you can see in the back there you have a lot of space and also what i notice is that the windows are very big on the on the rear and you have gorgeous visibility those are the seats a combination between leather and fabric material they look good they are big enough even for bigger persons to stay there without any any problem also you can see the stitches the leather here in the middle you have kind of an arm rest or support i don't know it's small you don't have any armors in the middle or cup holders the cup holders are here on the side also you have a speaker and here we have plastic so no soft material in this area everywhere here in this area it's plastic that's something to keep in mind but you have ease of fix for child you can install two child seats in the back and you can install another child seat in the front guys so keep in mind that you can install it also in the front so that's another cool thing that i see most of the people use it in those cars let me go inside here in the back let me check out the space so being here in the back you have a cup holder in the middle another one that's good also here it's no light on the roof but the roof quality it's very very very good also you have some hooks right here for some jacket or something like that now being here on the seats as i said they are big enough i sit before in in a seat in the back here and i have to tell you that it's really really comfortable you have also this big window so you have great visibility better than in four-door cars sometimes in some cars four fingers maybe five fingers over my head other than that it's very very comfortable here nothing to say guys i mean i i sit really really well because of the shape of the car as i said before you have a lovely lovely position here even if you pull down the driver seat this is my driving position by the way and this is a little bit more backward and you can see how much space i have on my knee 173 centimeters it's my height so in case you want to know this is the space if you want to fold it forward you do it like that also you have some storage space here with leather yeah it's pretty nice pretty nice the space it's really really good anyway now we will go in the front guys we will talk a little bit about the dashboard and the design in the front but overall i have to tell you that i like very much this uh unique design of the mini the way mini design the head-up display cockpit and also this multimedia system it's really cool and it's a nice uh young design and and i like it's very simple for for a city car it's just more than you need anyway let's go in the front here in the front as i said before frameless windows uh going to the door design of the door it's quite nice also pretty pretty modern then we have soft material on the upper side here everywhere soft material then you have this glossy glossy plastic that looks quite nice also here you have soft material you have an ambient light inside here you can see i don't know if you can see it's a bar an led light bar in the nighttime look good so soft material here soft material here on the armrest uh the only plastic part it's down here in this area here we have some storage space it's not that big but yeah it's okay better than that nothing then you have the buttons in chrome really interesting the way they design those buttons then you have the folding mirrors you can also fold it if you press this button and then you have the electric adjustable mirrors from here you can adjust it electrically this is the handle quite cool look at this how nice it is really interesting when you open it you open it with this lock and unlock buttons really interesting and also the quality of it it's very good you have a small speaker here and then at the entrance you have this mini cooper s i like very much displayed look really fancy other than that normal pedals really interesting design on the pedals they are normal you can see also the seats in the front fabric material seats combination with leather they are big they are bright so even big people can sit on them as i said in the back in the front the same story very good quality a lot of side support here they are super sporty they hold you really really good here in the seat and also the quality in the middle this fabric material sits it's really really good and if i'm not wrong this is made by recycled materials if i remember well also here in the front you can adjust this uh part you have manual adjustments for the seat so overall it's simple to use here guys keep in mind that you have the fog lamp button and you have those lights adjustment buttons that you can do it from here quite nice quite simple and also the brightness and all that stuff here in this area we have plastic then we go to the vents also quite nice vents very good quality as you touch them uh they feel quite quite good glossy plastic around here also on the upper side we have soft material you can see right here kind of a rubber everywhere on the dash it's soft soft material anyway let's go inside going inside close the door also the quality of the doors it's very good they sound really really good visibility around the windows perfect huge huge windows on the side good visibility in the mirror good visibility around the windows also as you probably know the mini minis car have this round round round round round shape on the windows and the windows are a little bit higher this a-pillar it's somehow designed to be a little bit upper and in this way they they make this uh window a little bit straighter and you have a different unique feeling here where you can even straight your hands until you go to the a-pillar you have a lot of space here in the cabin i like that i like this this feeling where we are inside the car and also as you can see the window is also a little bit round like in a spaceship it's it's cool i don't can see it on the camera but it's really interesting also good visibility in this mirror in the back because you have that big straight window there on the side perfect visibility this car has no blind spots so you can see perfect around the windows you can see one more time the seats in the back here in the middle you have an armrest something that not all the mini cars have i mean from other companies also you have a telephone place here you can put it up you have some storage space down here the center console although is made by plastic it's very simple to use and easy to reach the buttons that's important also it's pretty sunny outside if you want to start the engine this is the start the engine you press it like that just like that and you start the engine it's really cool really unique then you go here press this button go in drive down and now you're driving and let's go a little bit further it comes with electric uh break as well let's go a little bit forward where is no more sunny just like that here it's perfect press the p in park good now what i said is that it's easy to reach those buttons here and this is great this is the controller for the multimedia system here the same as in the bmw you have the same kind of controllers also electronic handbrake this is the stalk it's perfectly positioned very easy to use press the button forward backward just like that it's super simple it's very good positioning then you have two cup holders here some storage space usb 2 usbc a 12 volt port down there very useful and then you go a little bit higher here you have these parking sensors button look how nice you activate this activate them just press them then you have also this button here you probably wonder what is this this is the recovery the energy recovery so if you look on the screen you go high recovery or low recovery so yeah this is something that you should choose for yourself this is star stop engine button uh really interesting i like the way they design it then we have this button traction control and this is different driving modes from here you change different driving modes so you can see also on the screen you have the green plus like echo plus like green like middle and like sport so you can choose from here you can see the test drive video i explain you more about that in the video here's the climatic system you have physical button here very easy to adjust the climatic system so everybody knows how to do that we have also heated seats for you and the passenger in the front the glow box is here quite big for the size of the car i find it really really big and useful more than enough for a car in this class now close it here in this area you have soft material everywhere in this area glossy plastic nice design also those vents uh feel quite good as you touch it good quality on the vents uh also up here you have soft material you have the vents up here uh in a nice design i didn't see that before another car but from here come air directly to the windshield so it will defrost the windshield even faster and that's a good good thing up here you have a microphone you don't have any handle here but you have this mirror with two lights right here protection for the sun up here again you have sos button let me zoom in a little bit sos button you have the lights here also quite nice the way they put it on this i like this idea with those buttons that you go forwards backward it's quite interesting quite quite interesting now it comes also with a head-up display this is the thing that i um i don't like so much because the head-up display it's on this plastic glass there and it's kind of disturbing i mean when you drive it doesn't look so good was much better to be on the uh on the window but the great part is that you can deactivate it you can hide it inside and you will never see it and trust me when you drive the car you will notice that you don't need a head-up display because you have such a good visibility here on the cockpit that the head-up display yeah it's not so uh useful i should say but it's a good extra first for some people that prefer it the steering wheel guys let me show you how you adjust it manual adjustment from behind you can adjust it forward backward and this time when you go forward and backward the cockpit will stay there but if you go up and down you can see the cockpit will come with you so that's that's interesting and then you close it from here you'll lock it in place the quality of the steering wheel it's it's incredible i mean it's leather you can see the stitch is very good quality very good grip very nice size it's perfect it feels sporty to be honest that's why i tell you is one of the best sporty car in this class because everything feels very sporty so the steering wheel is not crazy assisted it it gives you that bmw sporty feeling and i know many people love that and i like that sometimes as well and this is great i talk about that in the test drive video more so check that video out here you have some buttons in glossy plastic for cruise control or that cruise control controllers are here and on the other side we have the controllers for the multimedia and yeah different different stuff behind the stalk here we have this bc button where you change and you can see also on the cockpit the consumption the kilometer down there how much battery left and stuff like that anyway and on the cockpit it's great the cockpit guys it has a great brightness you can see in the daytime you can see it very well also the multimedia system as well big nice you have everything there the car can read the traffic speed limit you can see how much range you have the temperature the battery here left 90 percent here you have you can see what happened with the energy it's great it is do the job perfectly you have there in the front all the information that you need nothing crazy nothing fancy but it's a matte screen that mean even when it's sunny outside you can see very very clear there in the front let's go to the multimedia system and i want to show you something really cool you see those lights here around this multimedia when you change the temperature or the the vent speed look at this that light is changing as well and when you change the temperature you go cold or warm it will change the color there look at this how cool is that i like that it's really interesting how this light work here it's a fancy fancy feature here in the middle we have the blinker button and also we have this button for the safety feature so when you press this button it will get you to the menu where you can see this collision warning pedestrian alert lane departure warning you can configurate this as well here so this is the front end collision warning early or late or wherever you want to do it and it's it's cool it has all these safety features right here and you press this button you get directly there now the great thing about this multimedia system is that can be controlled from down here so you don't need to use the touchscreen even though if you want to use the touchscreen you can use it without any problem it's work perfectly also here you have those kind of classic controllers from bmw from the multimedia i will use the controller it's much more easier for me guys to show you all so you have for example the menu here on the front and screen and on the menu let me zoom a little bit just like that on the menu you have the calendar here the second one you have the media multimedia where you have all that settings and radio and stuff like that then let me go back then you have the navigation it's the navigation that also bmw use it it's a little bit different in terms of design but it looks really really good you it works fast as you can see it's relatively responsive very responsive and that's a good thing and also you have all the charging station here if you choose a route and you will see that it's loading very fast this is one of my favorite thing that it's loading really really fast and you don't have to wait too much time so the processing power behind it it's very good now let's go back also we have all the settings on the map i don't want to go too much into details right now but you have a lot of settings on the map on the car and yeah whatever it's it's really really deep anyway the second one it's my mini on the my mini you have all the settings of the car like lightning doors key uh on the lightning you have interior light exterior lights so on the interior light you have also the ambient light the brightness of the ambient light you can set it up the way you want it exterior light you can choose here welcome light and stuff like that door key settings how you want to locate intelligence safety here you have all that safety features that you see before speed limit assist speed warning parking on the parking again you have all these sensors and uh configurate green that mean you choose here the green limit uh the speed limit for example and the green control i'm not sure also what is this active auxiliary climatic system here you can activate the climatic system when you depart or when you go you can schedule when you go on a particular time you can schedule from here vehicle tracking and yeah those are all here on the vehicle settings then you have system settings where you can change the language you can change the display uh brightness you can change the date and time the units kilometer mile uh bar and psi or whatever here's the settings of the sound and then you have the notification pop-ups software updates and all that stuff i will make a separate video with this multimedia system soon guys now going forward driver profile here you can choose your driver profile vehicle status is the car have some errors or stuff like that you will find it here check control tire pressure yeah whatever all this all the the the service information are here so you will find it here technology in action e drive here you can see also a potential it will show you how much kilometer you can save now the car have 167 range it stays there driver information computer board and all that stuff it's also very useful you can see also here all the info is about consumption um yeah let me go back my mini and yeah those are on my mini the next one it's mini connected here you can connect you can see that the car is connected to the internet you can see weather news and all kind of information that also bmw have it then notification those are kind of all the menu this is all the menu guys so here you find all those information it's really cool and very very very easy to to use it and to find different functions you can get used with it really 
27;Mini;2022 Mini Cooper SE;One Month Owning Our Mini Cooper SE Electric Car - Review And Cost To Charge;[Music] this is our 2022 mini cooper ac and this is my one month ownership review now this is not going to be an in-depth review in the mini cooper se there's a million videos out there on the mini cooper ac so i'm not going to waste your time with that rather a video on what it's actually like to live with an electric mini pros and cons do i still love it do i hate it charging and most importantly the charging cost which i'll show at the end of the video so let us begin with is it still fun well i'm guessing it is still fun because i never get to drive it my wife tries it to work and when she's not driving it my son steals it because it's free for him he drives a bmw 328 and he loves the mini and it doesn't cost him a penny but from the little i've got to drive it yes i still love it i mean what's not to love it's faster than the average car in fact it's faster than most cars it is better handling than pretty much every car other than high performance sports cars and it's virtually free to run i'll get to that later but yeah not having to worry about fuel stops constantly i could do with that car it's really great the auto regen feature is really really amazing if you don't know what that is basically when you lift off the gas it automatically sends power back into the battery there's actually a little gauge on your dash and it tells you how much power you are gaining back so it's kind of like a little game when you're driving about you don't want to touch the brake and that even means that you're going to be saving wear and tear on your brake pedal as well it's really pretty clever nighttime driving is really great up front you have the big led circles for daytime running lights and when it gets dark you've got very bright auto leveling led headlights super bright you see exactly where you're going no danger there and obviously the rear you've got your nice union jack tail lights which are both very bright and very distinctive so no one's going to miss you so let's talk about what we don't like about the car this won't take long there's only a couple of things and they happen inside the car the first thing we don't like is the gear selector as you can see reverse is all the way forward and drive is all the way back to us our heads want to move it forward to go forward and backwards to go in reverse very small detail but it's just a little bit annoying for us the second thing is the reversing camera now i'm sure you can switch that off or change the settings but it's just super paranoid about hitting things let me demonstrate so we have all our guidelines green and red and directions you're going to go if you turn you've got this outside circle of light amber is like okay green is good etc etc red is bad so let me show you what happens when you get even just a little bit close to an object it's freaking out so let's go outside and we'll see how close we are to stuff obviously tons of room here and i'm that far away and it's doing a freak out so because i want to bring the car all the way back to here it's going to make that horrible paranoid beep all the way back in a straight line even though i've got all this space i mean it's not the end of the world and i'm sure there's settings maybe sensitivity settings i can change but it's just a wee bit annoying when you're not used to having that audible alert i don't mind you know a visual alert i can see you know i've got eyes but i don't need the constant bleeping freaking out i know it doesn't want to scratch it's lovely paint but but that's it that's the only two things we can think of at the moment other than me not being able to drive it much because my wife and my son are always driving it and obviously i've got other toys to play with as well not bad for a dislike list while we're in the garage or halfway in the garage let's discuss running costs and charging now i'm going to base this on our level 2 charger which i'll show you in a second and how much it's costing per kilowatt hour and all that technical stuff i'll break it down a bit this is our level two mini electric charger which we got with the car as part of the deal now if you are not a competent electrician or a cheap scotsman like me get someone else to fit this and i'll show you why this plug three pin plug is the same as my welder i had the welder hooked up to a 30 amp breaker in the basement and the fuse box but i was told i would need a 40 amp to run this it's a relatively low draw for the mini because it's got a small battery and it requires 32 amps so you have to go up to a 40 amp breaker however the wire i was using for the welder looked like this it's a two wire with uh with a ground okay this is not big enough to run a 40 amp or a 32 amp charger i know this because i tried it because i'm a fill and i did monitor it and i did feel the wire start to heat up so don't use that more importantly if you're running a different type of electric car in the future it may require even more wattage like i know the teslas i think they go up to 60 amps that wire they just throw away that would actually burn say your housing fire everyone dies it's not a good story this is the wire you require for the 32 amp draw with the 40 amp breaker this is actually rated to 50 amps so even though it's rated to 50 i still can run a tesla or like a f-150 lightning off this wire it's no good so be very careful if you're doing it yourself make sure you research or you know touch the wire after we put on and see if it's burning your hand no seriously get someone else to do it this wire is quite expensive and here's something else you need to know a lot of new homes that are getting built will be getting built with this wire going to a plug in the the garage or outside specifically to future proof it because more more people will be buying electric cars so this wires actually short supply so if you're thinking about getting an electric car make sure you can get your wire first this roll of 10 meters which was the smallest amount i could get was a 180 with tax shocking only needed three meters so i've got spare which means i can either sell it or route it around to somewhere else in the garage or take it to my next house who knows but be warned right charger-wise as i say this is a three-pin plug the teslas and the bigger rampage wires uh cars and batteries will have a four pin plug right do i get too technical this is the one that came with the charger so i know it's good for a three wire plug plug it in it goes that color i don't know what it means it's basically just preparing whatever's inside this big magic box turns orange and then it turns blue which means it's good to go so let's plug it into the car and see what happens just ram it in there and once that little light is flashing yellow means it's charging the box itself will pulse well not the box the light will pulse also to show its charging and inside the car it will tell you how long it will be to fully charged i mean it's pretty much fully charged at the moment now here's something important don't charge it during the day charge it when it's off peak and i'll go over that right now so how much does it cost to run an electric car for a week well my wife and my son both work in a very similar location they're only about a kilometer apart from each other so the distance is pretty much identical however my wife uses the country roads and my son takes the highway is there a difference no apparently we live on this sort of level work is that level and there's a valley in the middle so there is a bit of them gravity involved which helps with regen the highway not so much so my son doesn't get the regen that i was talking about earlier like my wife gets so that maybe that's why it balances out okay on to the cost so here's a map of how far they go is a round-trip daily commute of about 80 kilometers and here is how much it costs we are talking average of about 80 cents to recharge it at night now what i was saying a little bit off-peak if you notice around a bit they are if you charge it before like seven o'clock obviously it's going to be different where you are but in canada after seven o'clock is off peak if you charge it before then the price doubles i mean it's not the end of the world it's only like a dollar fifty instead of eighty cents to recharge it this is recharging it from about 70 to fully charged we've never we've never taken the battery right down to to zero so we don't know how much that would cost but that gives you an idea and it's all very similar per day or per evening how much it costs so it's virtually three if you imagine how much a round trip of 80 kilometers would cost in an average petroleum powered car it'd be considerably more than that so it's cheap and it's very cheerful so wrapping things up any regrets on buying an electric money the only regret we have is we didn't do it you know it's truly truly fantastic little car if you're even considering one go for a test drive but make sure you take your bank details with you can pretty much guarantee you will leave the dealership with a receipt for a brand new electric mini right it's a big time i went through a wee drive i rarely get to drive a thing so i'm away for a bit of fun take care everyone i'll see you i'll see you around christmas or something i don't know i'll see when i get back i might be away for a while um [Music]

28;Mini;2021 Mini Cooper SE;2021 Mini Cooper SE 12,000-Mile Owner Review;on this episode of evie ryder we've got a 12 000 mile long term review of our personal 2021 mini cooper se ev we've had our mini coming up on a year and a half and here's a spoiler alert we love it anyone who follows many knows reviewers loved it with one glaring exception and that's the range the 2021 mini had an epa estimated combined range of 108 miles per charge from its 32.6 kilowatt hour battery the good news here is many under promised but over delivered on the epa's range estimate we've exceeded 108 miles multiple times with 5 or more of charge left doing primarily interstate travel which the epa rated at 100 miles the usual ev caveats apply your range will vary depending on driving speed driving mode and weather conditions evs do see range losses during the colder months although that's not a concern most of the time here in sunny florida the cooper se's limited range hasn't slowed us down we usually make a 215 mile round trip from jacksonville to new smyrna beach twice a month in the cooper sc our longest road trip so far has been 538 miles over the course of a three-day weekend rather than take more of your valuable time to go over the specs of the mini here they are feel free to pause this video if you'd like to spend more time reading them over likely because of the battery's small size mini capped the dc charging rate at 50 kilowatts per hour it takes about a half hour to get from a five to eighty percent charge with a level three charger as with most tvs the sc's charging speed slows down dramatically after eighty percent to avoid damaging the battery so most road trippers only charge up to eighty percent unless they need the full 100 to get to the next fueling stop now that we've got the mini's weak points out of the way here comes the good news it's every bit as fun to drive as a gas powered mini maybe even more so on a level 2 7.4 kilowatt per hour home charger it takes under 5 hours to fill the battery meaning you'll leave the house each morning with a full charge it's a great feeling never needing to make time for a gas station run on a busy day the electric cooper se feels as light on its feet as its turbo powered cooper s sister i recently had a chance to drive a new mini cooper s convertible with a six speed from a seat of the pants perspective the ev mini feels quicker since there's no turbo lag or rpm drop off during shifts as is the case with the manual mini motor trend measured a six second zero to 60 time on a 2020 se it tested mini's famous go-kart handling remains in my opinion the shorter range battery was an acceptable trade-off to keep the price and weight down build quality is excellent no squeaks or rattles have cropped up during our ownership the cooper se still feels as tight as the day we bought it the nearly white seats and floor mats are also holding up nicely the only service we've done so far is a tire replacement after picking up a nail while it's not showy the mini's infotainment and ergonomics are excellent the mini center stack includes an optional 8.8 touch screen although you'll probably seldom use the touch feature thanks to its jog dial setup and physical buttons unlike the trend toward big touch screens controlling just about everything the mini's jog dial and buttons will become muscle memory allowing you to quickly go from things like navigation to media without taking your eyes off the road same thing for the climate control in our case we got a fully loaded car so a heads up display is also a part of the package with redundant steering wheel controls you can quickly change channels without taking your eyes off the road while there is no adaptive cruise control available the traditional cruise is quick and easy to operate with steering wheel controls to nudge the speed up or down alexa is on board for voice commands and in my experience does as good a job with navigation commands as google assistant directions to the avenues mall processing your input avenues south side boulevard jacksonville florida say yes or select another entry from the list yes guidance has been started the built-in navigation isn't perfect but it gets the job done with one silly faux pas in addition to showing charging stations it also displays gas stations many if you're watching this it's time for an over-the-air update that removes those pesky gas stations the car has four modes sport mid green and green plus the modes adjusts the throttle response and climate control in green plus there's no heating or ac just the fan the car defaults to mid mode which is the everyday mode one pedal driving or coasting is also available with a quick toggle switch one of the wonderful things about one pedal driving is it basically simulates the feel of a downshift and sends regenerated power into the battery as with most modern evs the cooper se comes with an app that can do things like precondition the car remotely most importantly you can check charging progress remotely at the time of this video's publication the cooper sc didn't have any direct competitors in the u.s it's the only available two-door hot hatch ev currently being sold in the states if you want an open air ev the cooper se is also one of the few choices available there is a big trend toward fixed glass roof evs that don't open but thankfully mini is bucking that trend offering a full glass sunroof that does open to take full advantage when nice weather is in the forecast with the exception of range the cooper sc remains every bit as practical as its gas powered cousin it has a more spacious back seat than the convertible i drove and the car's rear hatch has the same 34 square feet of storage space as a cooper s with the seats down given the mini cooper is a sub compact you might be surprised to find out how much space there is in the back seat i'm five foot eight and as you can see i still have headroom and i still have leg room keeping the seat right now where it is when i'm driving the mini one thing you don't get is a frunk that area is taken up by the cooper ses inverter and other electronics so don't expect extra storage space because it's an ev circling back to the whole range thing can you really live with a car with a range of just over 100 miles in our case absolutely it's our second car so for road trips in excess of say 150 miles one way in the day we'll take the other car to avoid losing time to charge it we've done several overnight trips in the mini we usually leave home with a full charge and then charge at our destination or if the trip is beyond the mini's range we plan a lunch stop or other break along the way for families with a second car the mini is a strong affordable option for one person or a family with a single car there are better options out there although it will be tough to find one with as high a fun factor at the mini's price point if you're the type of person that doesn't do long road trips then a cooper sc still might work if you've got any questions about our many that i haven't already answered go ahead and ask in the comments section on the youtube page and i'll be happy to try to answer your questions and if you've enjoyed this episode of vv rider please go ahead and give it a like and subscribe so i can bring you more reviews and more adventures about the people and places in florida thanks so much for watching
29;Mini;2021 Mini Cooper SE;The Bite Sized EV | 2021 Mini Cooper SE;[Music] electric cars with 200 300 400 miles of range seem to be getting all the headlines these days but mini is going in a very different direction with their full ev the 2021 mini cooper se this is a full electric mini cooper and in my opinion probably the best mini currently made right now but it's not going in the same direction as some of those other evs that are getting all the headlines range comes in at 110 miles so definitely below the average tesla but thanks to its small size and low curb weight fuel efficiency in the real world is really good in this mini and the price tag is very low thanks to the small battery pack this comes in under thirty thousand dollars which means this is one of the least expensive electric vehicles available in the us and in my opinion this is the best mini period up front we get the same cheerful face as the rest of the mini lineup we get full led headlamps standard on the electric version fog lamps down there below there are a lot of yellow accents going on outside here and they're kind of a sort of greeny yellow accent it kind of reminds me of someone that has a sinus infection you can get the car without the yellow accents however so if you don't like these don't worry you can omit them and then we have little electric plug icons located all around the vehicle since cooling is less of a requirement for an electric vehicle they don't use this portion of the grille but oddly enough we still have the hood scoop even though it doesn't do anything although mini has given this a low sticker price i'm a little bit disappointed when it comes to active safety this vehicle does have forward collision warning pedestrian detection and autonomous braking on it but we don't have radar adaptive cruise control or lane keeping assistance or lane centering this ev is targeted at a slightly different customer than some of the evs that you'll find in america right now and you'll really notice that we take a look at the wheels and tires the alloy wheels feature an asymmetrical design and rather surprisingly these are wrapped in some really high performance tires these are goodyear eagle f1 tires so no ultra hard low rolling resistance tires here but they are 205 width so they're relatively narrow but that's enabled by a light curb weight focusing a bit more on driving dynamics and a little bit less on range and efficiency makes an awful lot of sense for this model because this is targeted at someone that wants a daily commuter vehicle or a weekend fun vehicle that's very style forward but doesn't need an enormous back seat or a big cargo area mini also says that their average shopper owns multiple vehicles already so this is an additional vehicle for them it's not their only car to choose from so this is targeted at someone that wants more of a daily commuter style vehicle and is a bit of a pragmatist when it comes to evs someone that doesn't really think they need the longer range because they have something else to drive if they want to drive 300 or 400 miles at a time although it's a little bit difficult to tell if you park this next to a standard non-electric mini cooper you'll notice that this rides a little bit higher it's nearly an inch higher off the ground that's because the battery pack sits under the vehicle it's not in the trunk or anything like that bmw says that even though this model is a little bit higher off the ground than the rest of the mini lineup the center of gravity is nearly two inches closer to the ground and not only that but because of the way the battery pack is positioned which we'll talk about in a little bit more weight is on the rear than in the front and that means this has a better weight balance than the rest of the mini lineup out back this again looks like the rest of the mini lineup except for this little yellow icon right there and of course the yellow s over there on the cooper logo we have led tail lamp modules that feature the british flag the union jack right there and then we have backup lights down there at the bottom in case you're wondering the turn signals are red they're not amber mini is known for building lightweight small fun to drive front wheel drive vehicles but electrification allows for a reordering of priorities and so i'm a little bit surprised that this didn't end up being rear-wheel drive and the reason for that is that we find the same electric motor that powers the rear wheel drive bmw i3 under here if you didn't know it bmw builds an awful lot of vehicles with plugs outside of companies like nissan tesla and general motors bmw is shifting the most vehicles in north america with plugs more than the combined entity of hyundai and kia actually more than hyundai kia honda and toyota put together so when it came time to design this mini they simply reached into the parts bin grabbed the electric motor from the back of the i3 and plopped it right here under the hood again i'm a little bit sad that this didn't end up being rear-wheel drive but it would have been a little bit out of character for the mini brand this motor produces 181 horsepower and 199 pound-feet of torque making this one of the most powerful minis you can buy in the us and because of the way electric motors deliver torque this is going to be faster 0 to 60 than some of the turbocharged options in the mini lineup that theoretically produce more power going in for a closer look you might be wondering what all these metal bars are for remember that in most vehicles with engines up front the engine is part of the crash structure or at least it's been accounted for in the way the crash structures in the vehicle operate so replacing it with an electric motor means that that crash structure may perform differently so they put these bars here to make sure it's consistent with the crash test scores we see in the rest of the mini lineup an important feature in here that's not immediately visible is that the electric mini has a heat pump not a resistive element heater for heating the cabin that means that heating this cabin in cold weather is going to be much more efficient than a lot of is out there including every modern tesla except for the model y heat pumps are available in a number of other electric vehicles out there but they're not necessarily standard in a lot of those options and for 29 900 you are going to get the heat pump standard in this mini that means that if it's 45 degrees outside or 30 or 20 degrees outside this vehicle is going to consume an awful lot less battery to keep the cabin warm speaking of the battery it's a 32.6 kilowatt hour lithium ion battery pack 28.9 kilowatt hours are usable it's arranged somewhat similarly to what we found in the chevy volt it's a t-shaped battery pack not a true skateboard battery pack so it goes from between the driver and front passenger seats approximately to below the rear seats the positioning of the battery pack means that we get exactly the same cargo area in the back and basically the same seating area inside that we find in the regular mini according to the epa tests this battery is good for 110 miles and 108 mpge but we have definitely been beating the 108 mpge score charging happens via this charge door right here on the passenger side of the vehicle we have a standard j1772 charging connector and a standard ccs fast charge connector having a smaller battery pack on board means that it takes less time to completely charge the battery and of course it helps improve overall vehicle efficiency which is certainly good in the mini cooper se even with these aggressive tires that we have on this model again these are eagle f1 tires if you have access to a level 2 evse that is capable of it this vehicle will charge at 7.4 kilowatts taking you from zero to completely full in four hours or a little bit less also an unusual twist mini is giving us two evses with this vehicle we have a turbocharged cord that will charge at 3.8 kilowatts 240 volts that will take this from zero to completely full in a little bit under eight hours and then we have a standard 1.2 kilowatt 120 volt cord that will take this from zero to full in about 24 hours or so pretty similar to the kia soul ev that i used to own for a lot of folks out there that are looking at this as a commuter vehicle if you're commuting 30 40 miles a day you'll have absolutely no problem charging this overnight with just the included 1.2 kilowatt cord at least for the moment the electric drivetrain is available only in the two-door four-seat mini cooper so no electric clubman or countrymen at the moment we have manual seats for the driver and front passenger in all versions of this we have a lever to adjust the seat height one to adjust the seat recline and then we have a knob on the other side for the lumbar support the logical reason for the manual seat designs is definitely weight savings but i wish these seats were just a little bit more adjustable i wish we could adjust the tilt of the seat bottom cushioned like we see in some bmw models with manual seats but we can't do that but on the bright side we do get a manual extending thigh cushion right here and the passenger seat has exactly the same range of motion as the driver's seat including the thigh extension and the lumbar support as with pretty much any two-door vehicle the mini is more about the front seat than it is about the back seat but you could still get back here in a pinch again this is a four seat vehicle only so no center seat belt back here just like the regular mini cooper the only real difference i noticed back here between this and the gasoline mini cooper is that the seat bottom cushions do appear to be ever so slightly thinner that could be an optical illusion and then under that we have a slightly different shape to the way the carpet is molded under there headroom is not exactly huge back here but you could definitely stick four adults in the mini if you needed to if i slide this front seat back into the same position that it was before you can see that my knees are definitely digging into the seat back but again if i really needed to i could make that front passenger sit a little bit more upright and a little bit further forward you'd be able to put a six six-foot person up front and a six-foot person behind with relative comfort now if i try and put my head back to these headrests i don't think it's actually possible to touch the headrest nope not quite my head is instead hitting the ceiling there but if i'm sitting in more of an average seating position than my hair is just brushing the ceiling we do have the panoramic moonroof on this model and that means that i have a separate shade right back here for the rear passengers again the rear seats fold in a 60 40 fashion which i do find a little bit odd because if you fold this 60 side then it really is cutting into this 40 side over here on the right side of the car because of the battery's position cargo space is completely unaffected by the electric conversion so behind this hatch we still find 8.7 cubic feet of storage space if you fold the rear seats flat you have access to about 34 cubic feet of storage space and the load floor can be raised up so that way it is level with the rear seat backs in addition to that lower load floor setting you can also open it and have access to the cargo area below or completely remove this from the vehicle so that way you have the most cargo space possible below that load floor we certainly have enough room to store your charging cables and then one thing that i've always found odd is that we do have a 60 40 folding rear seat back what's weird about that is that the mini cooper does not seat five it only seats four so that's a two person rear bench as we look around the interior you should know that although this starts at about twenty nine thousand nine hundred dollars the model that we're looking at is about thirty seven thousand dollars before tax title and destination so obviously there are features that you won't find on the base model like this two pane panoramic moon roof now one thing i have to comment on is that this moon roof shade does not block an awful lot of light and it does make the cabin a little bit hotter in really strong sunlight moving down from there we have fixed height shoulder belts and two-way adjustable headrests for the driver and front passenger the model that we're driving has this very attractive leather upholstery with some extra stitching going on there in the main part of the seat back and seat bottom cushion we have fairly aggressive bolstering for a small car and on the seat bottom cushion you can see that extending thigh cushion just a little bit more closely it's a very similar design to what we see in a lot of bmws the front doors feature a mixture of hard and soft touch plastics there is a soft touch upper section a soft touch armrest there sort of a rubbery middle and then harder plastics down there at the bottom of the door just as you'd expect around bottle holders in areas that need a bit more durability we have speaker grilles right there in the door and up here on the a-pillar because we do have the optional harman kardon audio system the styling inside is basically the same as the rest of the mini lineup except for this sort of yellowy stripe that we find there on the trim panel just on the passenger side the upper section of the dashboard is made from a soft touch injection molded plastic as is this mid portion of the dashboard and then we find hard plastic slower for instance around this glove compartment this is a slot style glove compartment and i was not able to fit a full-size ipad inside minis have long been known for their somewhat eccentric styling especially this very round styling element here in the middle of the dashboard this is no longer where we find the speedometer of course this is now where we find the infotainment system there's a standard infotainment system that's just over six inches that features a touch screen and apple carplay integration standard we're driving the fully loaded model so we have this 8.8 inch infotainment system with factory navigation now one thing that i found interesting is that we don't have quite as many different driving displays for the ev system as i thought there would be so there's a minimalism analyzer that helps you score your driving and your anticipation breaking scores etc there's one here that'll tell you whether you turn on or off the heated seats how much range that would give you there's an option to plan your charging and pre-condition the cabin just as you'd expect in an electric vehicle there are obviously vehicle settings in here as well and then we get a very quick onboard info screen which shows us our average consumption miles per kilowatt hour this is not our weekly total of course because this is after we've been zero to 60 testing range testing climbing hills having an awful lot of fun with it etc and then there's a slight variant on that as well below the infotainment cluster we find the controls for the dual zone automatic climate control this is also where we find the buttons for the heated seats no ventilated seats in here button for the parking sensor this toggle right here controls the regen braking you can choose between high and low regen braking but one thing that i found odd or perhaps a little annoying is that the vehicle always defaults to its one pedal operation and the maximum regeneration i wish that there was some other mode or some way to change the way that defaulted we have the start stop toggle right there and that same sort of yellowy green a button for the traction stability control system and then a drive mode toggle right over there below that we have a 12 volt power port usb input right there this does support wireless apple carplay so you don't need to have your iphone connected to that usb input for that to work two large cup holders right there a slightly different shifter than we find in the rest of the lineup this is a little bit more like bmw's shifters this is a joystick style so we pull back for drive press that button right there for park we then have the controller for that infotainment system there's some direct access buttons up top some buttons down there and then this moves side to side and pushes down to select we then have an electric parking brake between the front seats there's an itty bitty little center console if you open that up this is where we find the wireless charging mat for your cell phone and this compartment is also ventilated so that way your iphone does not overheat if we move that out of the way we find a little storage area right there between the front seats as well you can put some larger items there because there's probably about four or five inches between there and the bottom of the armrest our model has the optional heads-up display but rather than this being projected on the windshield it's projected on this small sheet of tinted plastic that raises and lowers from the dashboard the instrument cluster surprised me at first but then i remembered that this starts under thirty thousand dollars so that's why we find such a small lcd the lcd's upper corner is right about here and the lower corner is right about there this is a fairly small portrait style lcd instrument cluster the information displayed by the lcd is pretty basic we get our range and temperature right up there speed limit actual speed the position of the transmission right there whether we're in drive or park the drive mode whether we're in green or whether in the mid or right up there the red for sport and then in the lower right hand corner we can toggle through a few different readouts with a button on the turn signal stock to the right of the lcd we find an led display for the battery state of charge you can see we have these individual little led elements then we have something very similar over here on the right side for the power and charge gauge if we toggle through the two different regenerative braking mode you can see that that one little element turns on and off we then have an actual physical needle right here for the power gauge and then an led display for the zero to 100 portion if you zoom in really closely you can just barely see the outlines of the needle and little center portion that rotates moving out from there we find one of my favorite steering wheels it's a round three spoke design with some pretty aggressive sport grips up top i love the way the stitching is done here the bottom spoke is split and you can see if i put my hand behind there that we have that little union jack logo on the left side of the steering column we find the controls for the cruise control system for some reason adaptive cruiser tool is not available in this mini on this side we find the controls for the infotainment system including track forward backward volume up down voice command button and a phone button in our 0-60 tests this was surprisingly faster than the estimate 6.2 seconds 0-60 not nearly 7 seconds as they are indicating that makes us one of the fastest mini cooper models if you want to go faster than this in your two-door cooper you're gonna have to get something like the jcw version that will theoretically go zero to 60 about two to three tenths of a second faster than this but it's not going to feel quite like this it's not going to have the direct responsiveness that we find out of this electric drivetrain now rather unfortunately it's pretty obvious that bmw is limiting torque at lower rpms because they would simply overwhelm the wheels and you can see that because if we disable the traction control here and we simply stop this much torque delivered this instantly should give us some wheel spin and it doesn't we get pretty drama free acceleration we see basically the same thing going on in kia's nero the hyundai kona electric does allow you to have a little bit more fun as does the chevy bolt but generally speaking most of the mainstream electric vehicles aren't quite as crazy as tesla's tuning tesla allows you an awful lot more torque right from the start but of course the target market for the mini electric is a little bit different because this is considerably less expensive and it still qualifies for the federal tax credit which obviously we'll talk about here in a bit but that means that most folks out there that are interested in shopping for a mini electric are effectively going to be paying probably around twenty thousand dollars for a base model that will of course depend on how much of that tax credit applies to you and how much of the state and local incentives that are available also apply to you but if you're in a state like colorado this could be quite inexpensive as i said before mini's mission is a little bit different than some of the other electric vehicles out there they're not targeting extra long range but they're interestingly targeting good handling and good driving dynamics and that's why we find those eagle f1 tires on all four corners that helps out our stopping distance this is the heaviest version of the mini cooper this is over 3 100 pounds this is about 400 pounds heavier than the absolute base version of the mini and you will feel that out on the road it's also a little bit noticeable in the stopping distances but at 125 feet from 60 miles an hour to zero that's certainly shorter than i was expecting and shorter than something like an ionic electric or a neuroelectric and remember this model has two of five with tires but we still have excellent handling and that's possible thanks to the low center of gravity and just the overall suspension design that we find in the mini cooper this has a very engaging feel to it out on the road it's definitely a lot of fun when it comes to handling i'm certainly going to give this model an a now that's not quite as engaging as something like a jcw version of the cooper but i think this is more fun than the mid-level 2-liter turbo trim a lot of that has to do with the accessibility of the power and how the power and torque rolls on electric vehicles just have that instant power delivery you don't have to wait for a transmission to shift on the other hand i'm not the biggest fan of one pedal driving in any ev for some reason i understand that some folks really really love it and if you love it it is available here we can go to a complete stop i'm not touching the brake pedal at all take us to that full stop and it will hold it there it will blend the regen braking and the friction braking in order to do that and take you and keep you at that stop if we go to the low regen setting it's still about the same aggressiveness as we find a lot of evs out there feels a little bit more aggressive than your average internal combustion vehicle and there is no coast setting like there is in some evs i think that's a little bit of a pity i would have loved to seen some regen paddles or a regen shifter here in the center console or just a mode that allowed no regen at all most studies out there have indicated that zero regen with a combined blended braking system is likely the most efficient driving mode because in situations where it is truly more efficient to coast you can have that true coasting mode rather than trying to feather the accelerator pedal to find essentially coasting the counterpoint to the excellent handling ability is the ride quality out on a rougher road surface like we're on here and that's why i'm going to give this model a scene minus when it comes to ride quality this suspension is tuned very very firmly even though we have relatively skinny tires they're not exactly high high-profile tires and that means that we can feel a lot of these bumps on the road whether they're smaller imperfections or larger imperfections a lot of that is coming into the cabin now that doesn't mean the suspension of the mini cooper gets upset it doesn't this is very well planted even on imperfect pavement in the corners it just means that you are going to feel every one of those bumps as you're out on the road but i suppose that goes with the character of the mini cooper because they've always claimed that this has go-kart like handling and in some ways go-kart like ride quality as well when the road starts really winding you'll notice that the mini electric hasn't really lost anything versus the rest of the mini lineup the ride quality is a little bit different things feel a little bit softer because of the added weight the weight is really noticeable back there but we have a better weight balance than we find in the rest of the mini lineup and we have levels of grip that really are very very similar this is a ton of fun out on your favorite winding mountain road the tires the chassis everything just comes together and this is exactly what minis are all about when many owners talk about fun to drive they're not talking about 0 to 60 numbers definitely things that are faster 0-60 than anything in the mini lineup but it's about the feel it's about the zippiness it's about the road holding ability it's about that go-kart like stableness we don't get any body roll there's no tip and dive going on in here this is a ton of fun and when the car does lose a little bit of grip like you found in that corner it's very very predictable and a little bit more predictable than other minis because of the better weight balance now the weight balance in here is still not 50 50. we're told it's about 56 to 58 or so up front but it's an awful lot closer than the regular minis in our cabin noise test we got 73 decibels in here that makes us a little bit louder than some of the other small evs on the market some of that may have to do with the tire choice and of course the suspension design here these are more performance oriented tires than we find in many evs out there and they may be giving us a little bit more road noise wind noise is pretty well controlled but out on the highway at higher speeds you will notice a little bit of that intruding in the cabin in our ev range test this model performed very well we averaged 3.8 miles per kilowatt hour giving this an aoa real world range of 106 miles that's pretty close to the epa score and definitely usable for most folks out there the range in this ev reminds me an awful lot of the range in my soul ev that i had for three years that range was about 100 miles in real world driving it would be somewhere in the 80 to 90 mile range depending on exactly how hot it was outside it did have a heat pump as well and that really helped that out in cold weather and that's something that we see in this mini electric as well this has a heat pump system so range is going to be more predictable summer and winter rather than some of those other evs out there especially discount evs that don't have a standard heat pump system so if you're comparing this to for instance the base version of the nissan leaf or some of those other shorter range evs out there keep in mind they don't all have heat pumps in their base models some of them may have optional heat pump systems but you're not going to get it for 30 000 now my daily commute is a little bit different than my ev test route and on that driving route we averaged about 3.4 miles per kilowatt hour so a little bit lower than the 3.8 that we get in our range test when it comes to economy i'm certainly going to give the electric minion a 3.8 miles per kilowatt hour is decent as is 3.4 miles per kilowatt hour in my daily driving cycle this is definitely in keeping with other shorter range evs out there so if you're looking for something that's efficient that's economical that's very practical and definitely fun if your commute involves some winding roads this is exactly the kind of eevee that you should get this may not be as practical as something like an ionic eevee or a leaf or a nero or a kona but this is an awful lot more fun for 2020 the cooper se is the least expensive electric vehicle on sale in the united states it starts at nine 29 dollars but there is a pretty long waiting list at this moment i checked and it seems to be about four to six months so if you want one you need to go over to the mini site and try and reserve yours today the cooper se still qualifies for the full federal tax credit of 7 500 plus state and local incentives now obviously you should make sure with your tax professional that that applies to you if you're depending on those credits in order to be able to afford the car but if you do qualify for all of the incentives it could drive the price of your cooper sc down to just twenty thousand four hundred dollars and if you're living in colorado and you can get your hands on one this calendar year it could be even lower the model we were driving this week came in at 37 750 because it did have a very expensive 7 000 option package on it but even the base cooper se comes pretty well equipped we get a 6.5 inch navigation screen apple carplay standard led headlamps heated front seats and heated side mirrors as well automatic climate control and the digital instrument cluster are also standard but we don't see quite the same number of customization options available on the cooper sc that we find in the gasoline cooper although obviously there's a lot you could do after market before we dive into specific competitors let's talk about the competitive landscape the cooper sc is significantly less expensive than a wide variety of other evs out there and at this moment it also has one of the shortest ranges so it is important to keep in mind range of just about 110 miles when driven gently that puts the cooper se in a very interesting category it is significantly less expensive for instance than a tesla model 3. the model 3 starts at 37 900 and it does not qualify for any federal tax credits anymore and that means that any way you slice it the model 3 is going to be 15 000 more expensive than a cooper sc and depending on the exact local state incentives that you may qualify for it essentially could be double the price of the mini so while the model 3 i think is unquestionably the better ev it's also significantly more expensive and frankly just not competition neither is the nero the chevy bolt or something like the fiat 500e 500 theoretically could have been but it's actually been discontinued for 2020. we may or may not get the new 500e for 2021 we don't have any details from fiat at the time we're recording this video that leaves just two electric vehicles in similar price ranges to the mini cooper the nissan leaf at 31 600 starting and the hyundai ioniq at 33 045 both of those are more expensive than the base cooper se but we do get a little bit more range in those models let's talk about the nissan leaf first first thing you'll notice is it has a longer range nearly 150 miles versus 110 miles in the mini cooper but dc fast charging is optional and the on-board charger is not as fast as we find in the mini cooper so regardless of how you're going to plug it in the mini cooper is probably going to get you extra range faster also keep in mind that the nissan leaf has an air-cooled battery pack so there are some concerns about longevity and it's likely that the battery pack in the mini cooper could last a little bit longer bmw mini's parent company has had a long history of plug-in hybrid and ev models so they really have the battery thing nailed down the mini cooper i think is better styled it's also more fun it's also a little bit more unique really than the nissan leaf the nissan leaf comes across as very pragmatic very practical it's a four-door hatchback we have more cargo room we have more passenger room it's going to be a little bit more comfortable especially if you're a larger person on the inside because the vehicle is wider it also has wider seats a little bit more headroom here and there than we find in the mini cooper as well but it's not going to be as fun it's not going to be as unique as the mini either next up we have the hyundai ioniq the ioniq has a little bit longer range than the leaf at 170 miles but it's a little bit slower zero to 60 than the leaf the leaf is almost as fast as the mini cooper at about seven and a half seconds zero to sixty or so the ionic is around the eight second mark but what you give up an acceleration you gain back in range 170 miles and we get a lot of standard equipment the mini cooper has a standard dc fast charger which is an advantage over the nissan leaf but so does the hyundai ionic and it's the same fast charger connection really it's the sae combo connector which is becoming more popular and
30;Mini;2021 Mini Cooper SE;2021 Mini Electric Cooper S Review [Does Plugging it in, Take Away the Spark?];hi guys and today i've got for you the 2021 mini cooper s however this mini doesn't have a conventional petrol engine underneath this bonnet because this mini is green well yes of course it's resplendent in british racing green but what i mean by that is that this is the mini electric how can you tell well it's got the blanked out grille it's got no exhaust pipe it's got e badges and on the fuel filler cover it has an e and that's actually now where you plug in the cables this is in fact the third generation of the new new mini came out in 2014. i have reviewed it previously there's been a couple of updates most recently for this 2021 model year now i suspect an all-new fourth generation mini can't be far away and i wonder if a bit like what fiat has done with the 500 that's going to be in all electric range now so what's this then a practice electric mini well no not really because they already did that in the late 2000s they came out with the mini electric then but they produced it in limited numbers just a few hundred that one had no rear seat and limited luggage space this mini is said to be near identical to the regular mini in terms of interior space how have they done that well the 32.6 kilowatt per hour battery now sits in a t-shape underneath the rear seats and along the middle of the car but they have had to lift it by 18 millimeters to allow more battery clearance down there however the center of gravity is actually 30 millimeters lower because the batteries are heavier they add weight to the car how much weight they had 145 kilograms of the weight taking this up to nearly 1400 kilograms it's not slow though the motor at the front puts out 181 brake horsepower about the same as the petrol mini cooper s however it's got 199 pounds for the torque that goes to a single speed transmission to the front wheels virtually instantaneously that gives it zero to 62 miles per hour acceleration time of just 7.3 seconds and a top speed of 93 miles per hour now many claim that when you charge up to 100 you get a mileage range of up to 145 miles but when i got it up to 100 i saw an indicated 114 miles now the mini electric is available in three trim levels they're all badge cooper s but you've got level one level two and level three level one is just over twenty six thousand pounds this level two starts from just under thirty thousand pounds but with options on this test car it goes to well over 31 000 pounds i'll go over the options once we get inside the car now i know a lot of you will be familiar with the mini uh in this generation because it's been around a few years but we're going to take a quick look at the practicality we're going to look at the front cabin because there's been some changes there and then of course we're going to take it for the all important drive before we do that make sure you're subscribing to youtube.com forward slash brown car guy browncarguy.com and follow me on all the socials by searching for brown car guy if you enjoy my videos you can support them over at patreon.com forward slash brown car guy cool let's get into this [Music] so let's check out the back of the mini before we do that check out the tail lights they've got the half union jack introduced on this generation i kind of like that and of course like i said the yellow badges that denote the fact that this is the mini electric now the boot you can then open either from a button under here or with the key fob which is in my pocket check out the cute mini keyring that goes with that and all i do is press that bit that opens up not powered though once it goes up you've got about 211 litres of boot space in here which is about what you'd expect from a mini there is a little bit more space underneath this floor which of course can also be removed but the space in this car is basically taken up by charging cables tire repair kit and a first aid kit you get a home charging cable and you get a machine charging cable if you plugged in a home it would take hours to charge if you plugged it into a machine which i did do typically you get about 80 in 30 minutes so reasonable about what you'd expect for a mini now i'm not even going to attempt to get into those rear seats but regular size adults could probably just about manage if they're front and rear children should be okay they do have a child seat isofix anchor points on this car so they can be used for that or you can drop them down to give yourself more luggage space so that's quite useful in that sense time now to get into the front of the car and see what changes they've been in there should close it [Applause] here we are in the mini it's nice and comfortable it's good to be back in a mini a mini always feels kind of you know fits like a glove but you know it's a bit small but there's always enough room in the front especially for my long legs not an issue of course the steering is uh rake and adjustable so that's no problem and the instrument panel which is now new so let me turn this on the starter button is down here it's bright yellow that denotes the the fact that it's a mini electric and also you've got a bit of yellow on the gear lever as well again that shows you that this is the mini electric plus a couple other buttons so if i press that down all stereo comes on and this gets a new instrument panel now with a matte finish so although it's got no hood and no cover and you might think that that would be affected by reflections and stuff it isn't because the mat kind of kills all the reflections and it's never a problem so pretty straightforward i'm not going to go into too much detail the steering wheel does have remotes on it for the stereo on here for this cruise active cruise control on this car on here and on here you get a display on the left side which is basically shows you uh how you're using the power so when it dips down it's charging when it's up it's using the power 50 hundred percent here you've got the actual percentage remaining in the battery 100 50 percent down at the bottom is telling you 44 so it's telling you how much percentage of the battery is left and at the top is telling you the mileage range that you have uh available let's give temperature time and that's the speedometer on there uh this big center dial here is of course um a tradition now in minis and it stays in this car they've improved the the touch screen on this car now so you've got all of these systems on here you can also do that you can scroll through you can configure how you want this setup and it gives you down here the information on on the mini itself but actually if i just do that it's telling me 4.9 miles per kilowatt is what i've achieved on this car so far uh one thing i don't know about this i mean this has this light that goes up here that does various things depending on the music and the speed and stuff like that but the screen itself just takes up that part and you do wonder why don't they just fill the entire space with a digital screen but at the moment that's what they're doing maybe that's something they're going to do next time that's your sound your all all around active safety button is there the see it's come on in this car i should actually turn that off because that's just using up juice i can do that by just spinning that round to the left that's your climate control that's climate control buttons max ac heated seats on this car now this is toggle switches on here so the window switches have now been moved to the door same round patterns everywhere that you see typical of a mini you've got the starter button next to start about in traction on off and less important this button here is is the driver mode button so you have two green modes and you see them they come up here and it shows you on here and it shows you can configure the green but basically the green shuts down the ac reduces the comfort features reduces the the power available to basically focus on giving you the maximum range and you can actually see that the range maybe goes up by a mile or so when i change through the modes here it will start on the mid is its uh default setting but there's also sport and the sport will give you enhanced performance from the throttle but also a stiffer steering wheel we'll talk about that stiffer steering i should say we'll talk about that on the go there's also two regen modes so over here with this button you can select the regen so now i can actually turn the regens off actually no i've got either mild regen or full regen it starts on full region by default now the full region basically we'll talk about this on the go but that gives you a one pedal driving um which you kind of get used to you you will get used to actually i'll talk about that on the go but also what that does is it recoups battery power on the go every time you're braking you know you you recover some mileage we'll talk about that again as we drive the car down here there's a power supply in here there's a usb port two cupholders this is your single speed transmission no paddle shift doesn't need any so that's what you have there you have all your controls here this is familiar to people who have minis and recent minis and bmws it's got the same sort of menu system uh e handbrake little tray down here this tiny little compartment in the cubby box down here and of course this is an adjustable armrest which is quite handy um just quickly tell you about the options on this car like i said the level two this one it's got i mean uh they all have digital instruments and cruise control level two adds a speed limit to traffic sign recognition collision mitigation automatic high beam rear cameras heated seats and the part leather upholstery which you can see on these seats level um of course also get some mini connected services navigation the remotes on the steering as i mentioned automatic wipers automatic led headlights and nice fixed chelsea anchor points as i mentioned level three will add a heads up display wireless phone charging park assist that will park itself and the panoramic sunroof as well as harman kardon speak carton speakers on this one i don't think it has those but the stereo is pretty good i mean listen to it no issues so actually you're fine with the regular stereo the level three by the way i think i forgot to mention starts from 32 000 pounds um i will say that the car play and android or just got android auto carplay the car play initially was quite fussy to set up just by plugging in it didn't have to go into the menu and configure and stuff like that but once you've done that once it will automatically recognize the phone and it comes on every time you need it so that's pretty much straightforward so there you go that's what it's like that's the interior the changes to the 2021 model year what's it like on the go let's find that out next okay guys let's take this mini for a little bit of a run now i'm going to put it straight into the sports mode yeah i'm going to push straight into sports mode because i'm on some nice little bits of roads here so this should be interesting um so there's zero look at this there's a off the line you know and it actually twitches at the front you know so that the wheels front wheels are scrabbling and trying to find grip off the line um the crucial thing i think that nowadays you know we always measure the acceleration times zero to 60 miles per hour zero to 100 kilometers per hour i think that's very quickly going to change to zero to uh 30 miles per hour uh zero zero yes say zero to thirty miles per hour and zero to 50 kilometers per hour uh because for example on this car that time is 3.9 seconds and oh my god yeah you can feel it of course when you start to do this sort of stuff you will start to deplete the uh the range and the battery power but i gotta say it's worth it um the question so once we're doing this pair i'll get into the modes and stuff later on whilst we're doing this bit the question is does it feel like a mini still well you know they said that they tuned the suspension deliberately to make it feel like a mini cooper obviously they had to deal with the different ride height and the weight and stuff like that but the weight distribution actually improved because it had to change the more weight at the front so actually before it was 60 40 front bias now it's 56 45 44 front and rear by so it's actually improved a little bit gives you a little bit more of an even balance um which means that you know it's still as dirty oh man it really gets some torques there when you try to put the power down through a mid bend um so it's it's quite you know it's still as nippy and as agile somehow uh the the steering is not as alive as i think i remember it and particularly you know it kind of feels a little bit light like now it's in the sports mode and actually firms up and gets meatier in there but around the middle bit it's still a little bit light and i don't know no you're not getting any feel or anything like that so that's always a little bit of an issue uh with these modern systems so i think that's where the compromise has had to be made is that you've lost something there uh just in the sense that how you interact with the with the main interface of the car which is of course the steering wheel feels nice and chunky and all the rest of it but oh my god the acceleration of the line is extraordinary um there are quicker cars of course um but i think that off the line i imagine a few cars would keep up with this and then once you got up to about 30 um miles per hour you'd probably be overtaken by other cars i think that's what would happen but having said that minis are all about low speed fun aren't they they're all about you know thrashing around town and having a laugh you know with that sort of stuff and being able to charge our junctions like i did there without having to worry about what might be coming because you've already gone you know you've left the junction so to speak so the driving mode so now put it back into mid mode which is the sort of default mode but you know the acceleration is still there to be honest in the modes even below this to be honest the difference between i think the mid and the sports is really just the steering firming up steering is even lighter now but honestly like if you're just doing around town stuff it won't make any difference and then you've got two modes below that you've got green and green plus which actually configurable somehow and basically what they're about is turning everything else down and focusing on conserving battery power so for example the acu like i've got on at the moment would be reduced if i turn it down into i go mid uh green and then green plus and yeah i can feel that there is some air blowing through but it's nowhere near as cool as what it was just a second ago so let's put that back into mid the difference is subtle you recoup a little bit of miles on there but having said that if you really want to recoup miles you just leave it in full regen which is how i've been driving it you've got two modes of regen it default starts in the in the full regen mode you can then drop it one level down to the regular regen mode the full regen mode does allow one pedal driving now the one pedal driving i quite like i get used to it quite quickly i know some people find that a little bit awkward and hard to get used to but i don't have an issue with it um and the brake pedal still works like i'm in one pedal mode now the brake still feels the same way reacts the same way it stops the same way the good thing about this one pedal system is yes it will come almost to hold sometimes to hold sometimes almost to hold sometimes it still creeps forward you say oh is that a mistake is that a problem is that an issue no i don't think so because what they've done i think that compared to some other one pedal systems that i've tried is that you know the relentlessness of the the acceleration is ridiculous because there are any good changes either there you go just rather got a slight understeer scrabble around the grip turns around typical mini thing that it does so yeah that mini flavor is definitely there so uh what was i talking about the the acceleration the one pedal drive okay so the one pedal drive the thing you the thing about it is that sometimes with some of these systems is that they they're quite abrupt at that slower speeds and it makes it very difficult to maneuver and you know when you're doing car parking or tight maneuvering or something like that because it's just like on and off and it's quite tricky to manage that so this system i feel that is actually quite smoother and because of the way that they've done it um you're able to feather the throttle and stuff like that so even when it's creeping forward sometimes it creeps forward sometimes it stops but you know that's a good thing because it means you have to put the brake down and you know that you stopped it and you hold it on the brake so actually it's not a bad thing but i think with it overall it lends itself to a smoothness that is really good now i'm on a really bumpy road i've reviewed this you've seen in some of my other reviews this road i bring cars here because this is terrifically bumpy and small cars really suffer on this road but this one is doing really well and i think there's two reasons for that one is of course the lower center of gravity the weight is low down it's very rigid lower down so it's holding down 16 and 17 inch wheels this is i think is a 17-incher um they don't go bigger than that because they find the ride is very fidgety and i will confirm that around town over here i'm getting bounced around a little bit as well but overall it's actually quite solid and composed i think one of the things about the mini is that it is quite solid around town it is a bit fidgety and a bit nuggety um and again i don't put that down to anything that they've done to the suspension because they've obviously tweaked it i think i put it down to the usual problem that i'm finding with uh hybrid cars electric cars where the batteries are in the the platform of the car is that there's an extra level of rigidity uh and inflexibility that's brought into it that i think somehow transmits more to the cabin i i don't know i'm just finding that that's the case i haven't confirmed or denied that with an engineer but that's my own perception that's what that's how i feel about it um so as you saw from that little drive there now we're in traffic now so now we're gonna i'm gonna go into no it's in full regen mode i'm going to leave it in mid mode because to be honest there's not that much to be gained from green i think the green mode you go into when you know you're starting to run low on range and you're starting to get a bit anxious and then you go let me just put it down into green and green plus and then geek out a bit more so i've got the ac on and stuff like that so um i'm going to leave leave things as they are so in traffic in this sort of scenario is where these cars are best is what i'm beginning to learn and this one is no different yesterday or the day before i took it for a long run from west london over to east london along the north circular long circular was typically very very busy on the way there and it was a lot of stop go traffic now in stopgo traffic i found that i didn't really lose that much range because every time you're slowing down every time you're stopping every time you're using the brakes the regen is just recharging the battery and when the time i got there i was like oh okay you know i haven't i haven't it doesn't equate to how many miles i've done the range is showing the range that's gone down is not the same as the miles that i've done which were greater so that was a good thing on the way back which was later in the evening the roads were more free-flowing so i was able to go you know that no circular road is about 50 50 miles per hour in some places so you're able to go at that speed because the road was clear when i got home i had to use much more of the battery so that's the funny thing about this car is like when you're having a nice clear run you end up using more of the battery and then when you're stuck in traffic you actually use less of it so it's kind of better for you that's really weird isn't it and of course the thing is that time becomes a big thing with these cars is that you have to start to calculate in you know your recharge time you have to start to work out okay i need to allocate an hour 45 minutes 30 minutes to spend some time recharging the car as i had to do today before i came out and did this so that's that's part of the process of owning and driving one of these cars and of course that adds the time and then if you're saying that will actually perform better in traffic well the traffic is taking up more of your time and then you're trying to find more time to then charge the car talk about electric car dilemmas so overall then i think the the thing about this car what i would say is that if you live in the city if the vast majority of your mileage is in town and thereby you're in a big city thereby you're normally stuck in traffic then by all means go for this because it will ultimately i guess even though you're paying more for the car work out cheaper in the long run if you do a lot if you spend a lot of time and a lot of miles driving around town if not then it's hard to justify this car um over the petrol cooper s especially as i still think that the petrol cooper s is still slightly more engaging to drive although you know as electric cars go this one ain't bad at all you know and look at this i mean look just dying through this roundabout you can you can steer it on the throttle it's just you know you understand you pull it you pull the throttle back you can tighten the corner back on the power you know it does the mini thing that you wanted to do but i wish there was a little bit more that i was getting from the steering so that was that's the only thing and i think that numbness comes from this now being an electric car so overall then i think a thumbs up for this car i think it's actually really good i think it's really well done i think it bows really well for the future of um you know mini and what they're going to do with their cars um would i have one like i said if i lived in town if i had my own drive and i could fit a fast charger at home so i could just keep it plugged in so not have to worry about charging it and stopping places to do that most of the time that would be enough like i said when i sized it up it gave me 114 miles rather than 145 for most of use that would be enough so it would work out um so in that sense yes i would consider it and i think that this is something that uh definitely you should pull on your short list particularly if you're in the market for an electric car but it ain't cheap at least you don't lose anything inside not that there wasn't that much space in the back anyway uh but that's not what the mini is about anyway there you go there's the review on the mini hope you enjoyed that let me know what you think of the mini in the comments about below

31;Mini;2021 Mini Cooper SE;The 2021 Mini Cooper S E | A Race To The Next Charging Station!;what is going on you guys welcome back to the channel my name is marcus and here today in front of us is the first all-electric mini cooper it's a mini cooper s and here in canada it starts at 39 hundred and ninety dollars let's get into it okay so starting at just under 40 000 canadian this is actually in fact one of the least expensive electric vehicles on the market today not only that it's one of the smallest but there's a trade-off here it also has one of the shortest ranges of any electric vehicle it's rated at around 185 kilometers of range and if you're really booting it you're not even getting close to that so we're going to get into that this is basically the fully specced out uh premiere model as you can see it has these kind of lime green yellowish highlighter accents on it uh as well as a signature cooper s hood scoop that is in fact uh doing nothing it's that's a fake that's a fake scoop right there um a couple different changes on the cooper s versus the normal gas powered one because of the batteries as you guys can see it actually sits a little bit higher up in ride height because you know to compensate for the batteries and some of the suspension components are carried over from the larger mini coopers but let's go for a drive we'll take it on the road and see how it actually performs in real world conditions and how it charges et cetera et cetera let's go for a drive all right here we go you guys this is going to be the most silent roads untraveled video ever but that doesn't mean we can't just mat it and go all out and that's 120 kilometers an hour so mini cooper s this is not just any mini cooper s this is the very first all-electric mini product very exciting times okay when we basically the only i believe the only all-electric vehicle we've ever reviewed on the channel was back in 2015 we drove thanks to uh see the sky exotics and ali henderson we were able to drive a p85d a model s p85d uh when that was you know relatively new that was basically a brand new uh car it was the fastest tesla model at the time now in tesla's world kind of considered slow while not slow at all but that's the context there since then i've driven a couple of electric vehicles uh nissan leaf bmw 530e which is a plug-in hybrid so yeah you know drive around a little bit on only battery power in that car but this is a mini cooper s but with no gasoline which is funny because immediately when you look at the car you're like okay well it's still you guys it still has a hood scoop no it's not pulling in any air though it's actually just a blocked off plate but it still kind of has that mini essence in that mini cooper s kind of cool young hip look to it which you know these modern bmw minis have been known for for quite some time now so like i said starts here in canada at 39 990 uh this one as we'll get to in a little bit is pretty much fully specked out uh because it is march here in bc so this one has been given to us from mini with winter tires now normally this car would come with 17s regardless across the board but this one is fitted with 16 inch wheels now i don't know if these wheels have come off like some other mini product but i didn't see them when i was on mini ci i did not see these wheels you were able to spec them on this car so that's kind of interesting but just because it is cold out we are running the winters and that probably will cut your range down a little bit now like i said 181 horsepower 199 pound feet of torque uh and that doesn't sound like a lot to me a gear head to you guys maybe mini enthusiasts maybe not that may absolutely just sound like a laughable amount of power and torque anything under 200 horsepower these days in my opinion just seems like not enough it's gonna be gutless but that is absolutely not the case not the case here in the mini cooper this is the most insane 200 pound feet you will ever experience in your life and i'm not exaggerating um see here we'll slow down a little bit to about 50 kilometers an hour and if we mat it the tires are struggling for traction and that's a hundred kilometers an hour so it's not slow this is not a slow vehicle they didn't just take a mini cooper and keep the s badge but then kind of dumb it down and expect you just to not know it's no it's every bit as quick as your standard mini cooper s and in fact the 0 to 60 time is right around the same which is kind of cool now as you guys can see here a few things you don't get with the base model you do not get the heads-up display which has its own issues you do not get this larger 8.5 inch touchscreen with the base model but what you do get is of course the same range which is the biggest uh the biggest upside with this car but honestly also the biggest downside with this car it's only rated at around 185 kilometers of range on a full charge however this morning fully charged we had it charging for you know 11 plus hours overnight and fully charged this morning it said i had a range of 170 kilometers and on the left here on this lcd screen here you can see how much power i'm using with the throttle at any given moment and if you keep your eye on it you'll see i'll generally be you know at the top fifty percent of the power because it's you know i'm driving a cooper s you don't buy a cooper s and drive it like you do a nissan leaf which is i believe what the kind of target audience here that mini's going for okay but let's put it into perspective because the cooper s does have many things going strong for it as far as the eevee competition goes it weighs between three and four hundred pounds less than a chevy bolt or a nissan leaf that inherently just will make it more fun and that is absolutely the case here well no not as fun as rowing through the gears in a gasoline-powered mini and it will never be as fun as that to me it is absolutely more of a driver's car than any ev i've ever driven including that p85d but at the time the model s other than the straight line acceleration it didn't really do much for me um but here as a city car this electric mini cooper ev actually makes a surprising amount of sense if and you really have to calculate how much your commute is and kind of how practical it is for your own life but if you're only kind of going around the city and you can live with less than 200 kilometers of range it is a fantastic option in the ev market especially for the price if you drive it like i'm driving it now at full throttle which is quite the experience honestly i mean we're you can scoot along real quick real quick especially from a dig above 100 kilometers an hour it's kind of a letdown that's when it really starts dying down and i actually believe that uh the mini cooper se has a speed limit and for us gear heads this is extremely important i believe this car actually has a speed limit or a hard cut at 93 miles an hour which is slow that's about 150-ish kilometers an hour while yes here in canada that is well it over any posted speed speed limit in the country and for us gear heads that doesn't that that really doesn't matter um so to see a 93 mile an hour hard cut limiter is kind of a disappointment but it is a cooper s that is not catered towards the gear head it just isn't um it's catered to the less expensive lower end of the ev market but that being said when you test drive it it's guaranteed this is gonna be way more fun than a bolt or a leaf or any of the kind of lower you know the new hyundai i forget what it's called but their new electric vehicle guaranteed without question this is going to be more fun to drive on a back road because it does have such low range it does have quite strong uh regenerative braking and it has two settings for that now this is where i've totally yet to get used to driving evs as two settings one like let's say i let off the throttle here at 75 kilometers an hour it's going to kind of engine break while recharging the battery an hour down to 50 and 40. so it's kind of slow right that being said it's still like more of a stronger kind of engine break than most gasoline powers powered cars i drive and there's no third setting there's no like off there's no true coast mode in this car the other setting is strong regenerative braking which from 90k it's it's like you're pretty hard on the brakes it feels like you're hard on the brakes right but i'm not touching anything and the car will just come to actually a full complete stop and i haven't touched anything so you can drive this vehicle with just one foot if you get really good at it i still find it super weird i don't like it i i go in the you know the low setting which maybe has contributed to the lower range i'm experiencing but that being said it is worth noting um one other kind of negative that i've noticed is regardless of the trim package you go with you don't get adaptive cruise control which in an ev because you don't have gears and because you don't have that just general sense of how fast you're roughly going at any given moment as you would in let's say a manual transmission or even an automatic where you feel it shift and you can hear the engine note roughly know what rpms and what speed you're going it seems like adaptive cruise control would be just on the base model because it is so hard if you're not constantly looking at the speedo to really know how how quick you're going there's no real sense of it just overall so that is definitely a downside i have no idea why mini included like the heads-up display but not adaptive cruise control seems strange to me but that being said it is still a mini cooper s it is still fun to drive it's got plenty of grip even with these winter tires on here and around the city like for its size and for the amount of torque it has there's gonna be nothing quicker basically around the city than this car you're gonna get off the line and across the intersection quicker than basically anything other than uh you know some of these other evs that cost way more it is it's it's really remarkable how far 200 pound feet has gone uh in this car but all right let's try and find a charging station and we'll talk a little bit about the pricing and what options you get as well as how quickly you can charge back up and get right up back to that 185 kilometers fully charged range so let's go see if we can find a charger [Music] okay so i already have begun to hate electric vehicles even more um that's a lie i don't hate them but we are here here in south surrey british columbia at grand view heights aquatic center and we've run into our first real world issue with electric vehicles now as you can see beside us there is a nissan leaf it's kind of cool to see the competition here and there's two ev charging spots now we'll go around to the back um and let's open up the uh cap here get ready to charge right should be just that simple oh oh wait there's no cable here so this this charging center at grand view heights aquatic center only has one of the charging cables installed so we physically cannot charge at this location even though i looked it up on google maps beforehand and it states there are two charging ports uh and there's there's literally a cap on the bottom here so it is not possible for us to charge we were gonna yank the we're gonna yank the cable out of the nissan leaf but kind of decided against it it might not be the best idea so let's hop back in the car hopefully we don't run out of range and go find another charging location jesus okay so luckily we do not live in the middle of nowhere and it only took about two minutes to find another charging port and this one ah thank god it actually has a cable attached to it so we're going to yeah we're just going to plug it in and i'm going to talk a little bit about what you have to do you have to tap let's tap my visa here continue card is now authorizing this is my first time plugging in uh an ev at a public charging point okay so now it's unlocked and we're good to go bring this around to the side here pop this open and here we go okay so basically mini cooper s e comes with from the factory just a level one charging cable right so that's you could just plug it into your normal outlet at home that'll take a crazy amount of time even just to get you up to that 185 kilometer range it takes about i believe eight to 11 hours this should be a level two so many claims uh it'll take you from zero percent to eighty percent in about four hours and then if you're able to find a dc fast charger that will actually take you from zero to one hundred percent or zero to eighty percent uh in about 35 minutes so that's like crazy quick you can literally just you know do some errands go grocery shopping whatever get some food uh and 35 40 minutes later you're back up to 80 percent so like i said it does start the base model here starts at 39 000 but this one fully optioned out is about 47 000 canadian now i want to and this isn't a knock on mini but it's just to put things in perspective real quick for an extra four to five thousand dollars you're hitting a base tesla model 3 okay which has more than double the range and i'm gonna leave it there that's all you need to know you guys can do your own research on evs prices options but if you're really looking for just a really small compact city ev i'd suggest you just go with the base model but if you need all the tech and you know the extra moon roof you do get wireless charging you get a bigger lcd screen with this top model uh you get the heads-up display you get the accents you get options for cool wheels there's a bunch of things you do get but if you're looking at the top model i would highly suggest looking at some of those other evs with more than double the range of this for only you know three to five thousand dollars more it hasn't gotten old driving a silent car like it's really fun to drive like an uh and drive how i would drive a sports car where normally that style of driving would get people to either call the cops or give you dirty looks or be like slow down in an eevee nobody's looking at you because they can't hear you it is it it's just the inherent stealthy nature is absolutely the number one thing i love about evs um i do love evs as a daily now will i ever not own a gasoline-powered car no i will own gasoline-powered cars for the rest of my life it's kind of making me nauseous though you guys and i'm not exaggerating the if you're not used to it which i am absolutely not the sensation of just the utter smooth silent acceleration and torque delivery from like zero to a hundred if you're you know it can can get away from you real quick and you don't realize how quick you're accelerating but you do it enough like i'm beginning to feel a little bit you know unsettled in the head not not quite nauseous but uh you know approaching that anyways thank you guys so much for watching hopefully you guys enjoyed this quick review on the 2020 mini cooper s e be sure to subscribe if you haven't already hit that notification bell we just put out a video recently with an 850 wheel horsepower r35 gtr um and as well a 450 wheel horsepower sti we're not going away from the modified cars at all this year in fact we're going to be doubling down both on the modified car stories as well as really only driving the manufacturer and brand new cars that we find really interesting and that you guys may enjoy as well so thanks so much for watching we'll see you soon [Music] do you
32;Mini;2021 Mini Cooper SE;The New Electric MINI Is a Game Changer, But It's Not Why You Think!;it's a great time to be a car enthusiast in 2021 or even just in the market for your new vehicle because we've got choices and i'm talking gasoline versus electric is it time to maybe hang up the dinosaur juice and move to electricity or should you give electricity a few more years and go with a more conventional gasoline system so what we have here are two pretty much identical cars but they're unique in that as we talked about one is gasoline and one is a full electric vehicle let's start with the british racing green one to my right this is called the mini cooper s jcw jcw is the john cooper works trim of the mini cooper s and as such this is the performance version of mini's little two-door hatchback under the hood is a turbocharged direct injected four-cylinder transversely mounted as minis have always been it's uh powering the front wheels via a six-speed manual transmission imagine that in 2021 you can still buy a six-speed manual now this island blue mini is quite a bit more unconventional so a couple years ago bmw launched the cooper s e e standing for electric and what they did is they started with a standard mini they ripped out the gasoline powertrains and instead replaced them with electrical systems so this one is powered by a 181 horsepower electric motor that makes pound-feet of torque that's made into a direct drive transmission so no gears to shift and it still powers the front wheels as the mini gods have intended now the batteries live underneath kind of toward the rear and as such it sits about one inch higher to accommodate the large battery pack still get all the same interior room though as the gasoline model so how far does this go on a single charge well the epa says 114 miles we've found through our testing you can stretch that more to like 130 or 140 if you drive it nicely but the cool thing about these electric cars is that if you have a place to plug them in at home they're really really convenient and cheap to use so for example we just plug this in we go home at night charge it up overnight wake up with essentially a full tank now a full tank on the mini cooper s jcw well gas is getting quite expensive if you run premium figure probably well over 40 dollars of course that'll get you 300 miles or so a full charge on the cooper se well that's only going to cost you a couple of dollars depending on how much your electricity rates are at home charge time zone that's another story on 110 this could take as much as a couple of days to fully charge on a dc fast charger zero to eighty percent in about 35 minutes now most folks at home are gonna install a level two charger which is basically your dryer outlet and that'll take a few hours from empty to full but if you're charging it overnight who really cares now comparatively the gasoline car of course is only going to take a few minutes to fill up which for a lot of folks is very familiar and is a big advantage but another advantage for the electric one is there's not much to service on these ev cars there are no spark plugs change no oil to change uh brakes last a long time because of regenerative braking and in fact the power train in this car is going on what is that eight years old nine years old so it's pretty darn sorted i think that this one in the long term might even be more reliable than the 2-liter turbo [Music] so behind the wheel of the gasoline mini and let me something straight right off the bat this car is properly quick it's just a little 2-liter with 220 horsepower but the car even though many folks say it's gotten really big it still is remarkably small and compact and yeah when you put your foot into it it really takes off and of course being the jcw this car handles like none other it just grips the road steering is very direct not quite as playful as some of the older minis in the rear end coming around but still is a very very fun car to drive so that's the good the bad is that um it's kind of soulless unfortunately a full disclosure i've owned a ton of these minis and this latest generation which debuted in a 2013 called the f56 it just doesn't have much pizzazz as some of the older models and these new direct injected four cylinders make all their torque really low which is good for kind of passing but when you get up high it's not really z and this car's got a lot of what they call rev hang so going from shift to shift it takes a long time for the revs to decay before you can actually rev match to the next gear which is a real shame and kind of makes it frustrating to drive easy to drive as a beginner but as a more advanced driver it can be um a little primitive but if you still want a really fun car that just absolutely zips along it's hard to beat the cooper sjcw if you can afford the price tag so on the inside these cars are well pretty similar a little bit different here and there now this is the john cooper works model the sporty one so it's got these very aggressive bucket seats i'd almost say too aggressive for daily driving especially if you are a larger big mac kind of individual but if you are looking for your ultimate track sporty experience this is definitely it now it's important to realize that um these mini coopers are kind of a hard thing to sell in america because they are like baby bmws they're very luxurious on the inside very well assembled on the inside but you do pay for it so for example this one has heated seats got automatic climate control the 8.8 inch display all the materials feel super high class the snapple of the steering wheel is incredible but this car has an msrp of nearly 41 000 now you're probably thinking well 441k could get one heck of a veloster n or golf gti or even like a golf r and you're right yeah the value is a hard sell on these cars i'm not going to lie the interiors on these are better than all the vehicles i just mentioned but from a performance or horsepower per dollar standpoint those probably are better values now the mini cooper se is a little bit less aggressive on the inside compared to the jcw because this car is more of a cooper s competitor which is like the slightly lower horsepower version of the gasoline car as such these seats are actually much better i just love this almost white denim material it really looks great very good seats very comfortable the bolsters still do the cool stuff that they do on the jcw now the interior is almost identical if you're looking at buying one of these cars i strongly recommend the lighter interior obviously it's a little car and it really opens up the cabin the silver accenting across the dash is very similar now this is a signature plus it's missing a couple of options compared to that one so for example no wireless charging in the center no heads-up display which is a good thing because i hate their heads-up display but it still has heated seats automatic climate control you still the same level of quality the same dual sunroofs it really is quite nice in here so pricing wise this is where things get a little bit interesting the cooper se starts at just under 30k it's one of the most affordable electric cars on the market today this one with a bunch of options including this cool tri-color roof 37 000 which sounds like a lot of money for a vehicle that goes 114 miles but once again because it's an electric car there are some benefits for example uh this car still qualifies for the federal tax credit so you can get up to 7 500 back on your taxes on the federal side and then of course you've got the state incentive so in colorado uh for example because our liability for the company is more than 7 500 we get the full federal and state so this car quickly becomes more like a 26 or 27 000 car versus 37 and then it becomes much more attainable which is kind of a cool thing time for the all-electric mini gonna plant it not much happens until about 35 and then it actually takes off pretty decently mini says zero to 60 in 6.9 seconds now it may not feel all that quick from a stand still once you're doing like 40 if you plant it like it gives you a nice little shove in the back as you accelerate down the road of course completely silent now there's a lot less drama than the gasoline right no gears to shift there's no sport mode to engage with the exhaust or whatever there is a sport mode though which kind of sharpens up the steering and the throttle response but this is still a very fun car to drive and i actually think in a city setting in some cases more fun to try because you can really zip your way in and out of traffic and through small areas without having to wait for the turbo to spool or having to change gear i think in a lot of ways this car is a better kind of replacement to the original mini which was intended to be an affordable car to take people around and just happen to be fun now thirty thousand dollars doesn't sound very affordable for starting but when you factor in the tax credits twenty or twenty five thousand already sounds a lot more affordable um and for the amount of fun you get it's pretty good it's really good now it's not quite as sharp as a jcw and you certainly feel the additional i think it's like 600 pounds but it's a lot of fun still is a ton of fun from an exterior design standpoint very similar obviously different colors this jcw has a red roof which looks great and then against the british racing green it's got a good look we also have dual exhaust which has been a cooper s trademark since 2002 big diffuser along the back and then up top giant spoiler now the cooper sc has got a little bit of a weird thing going on down here with the wheels these are meant to look like a british plug socket from the uk which is why they're asymmetrical people either really love them or really hate them i'll tell you that much but there are other wheel options still have the union jack tail lights still have a small spoiler up here but then coming down to the bottom no exhaust pipes whatsoever so they've completely gotten rid of the exhaust pipes they've made the cooper s badge this kind of limey green and then they put this electric badge on the back and i think this is also optional depending on how you spec the cooper se [Music] all right so which one should you get the gasoline or the electric version of the mini cooper is it time times go eevee in 2021 now i can't convince you that 114 miles of range is enough but it's enough especially for a small car that's built to go in the city and maybe the occasional day trip if you've got a place to charge it up at home there's a good chance you're not driving over 100 miles each and every day even on your longer commute so i kind of am leaning toward the electric mini between the tax incentives the instant torque and instant acceleration it's a lot of fun now the gasoline mini is still brilliant but unfortunately the modern day engine they've really lost some of the soul and the pizzazz of the old one so i say give the eevee one a go as always this has been tommy with

33;BMW;2023 BMW 320i ;Is base spec best? 2023 BMW 3 Series review: 320i sedan | Family of 3 tests Mercedes-Benz C200 rival;foreign the new BMW 320i M sport is fun and looks great but is it a serious competitor against the luxury Rivals the Mercedes-Benz c200 and Audi A4 stay watching and find out I've always been a fan of the three series and back in the day it was often the entry to the brand for first time Beamer owners back when they're a fair bit cheaper and the one series hadn't arrived this is the 320i and it is the base model but it will still cost you a healthy 79 000 before on-road costs the M sport variant comes with some great features like a mixed synthetic leather trim a 12.3 inch touchscreen multimedia system Apple carplay Android auto and a sunroof to name a few the full specs are in my written review at carsguide.com if you need more details for such a Sleek looking sedan it's actually very generous up front I have plenty of head and leg room taller passengers will also get excited with extendable under thigh support and that you can set the seat to sit quite low my six foot two brother has a 328I and has plenty of room you just will encroach on back seat passenger Comfort the trim on the seats looks great but they are very firm and you're going to notice that along Roadie when you make a pit stop because you're going to do lots of stretching but I do like that they have side bolsters that are adjustable because they really tuck you into a corner when you're tackling or Winding Road the storage is good for the size of sedan but passenger space has been prioritized still what you do get like the glove box middle console will suffice for everyday use the multimedia system looks fantastic and if you don't want to muck around with the touchscreen you also have a rotary dial but all in all it's a beautiful dashboard the only thing that I don't love are the little prongs at the back that stick it up you don't really notice it from the driver's seat it has Wireless Apple carplay and Android auto but the satellite navigation was also very handy to use the digital instrument panel looks really nice and I love the clear Head Up Display and the steering wheel feels awesome underneath the hands you're also not going to have any issues with charging up front with a wireless charging pad a USBC and a port and a 12 volt Port too the back seat feels cozy but I still have a decent amount of leg room and Headroom back here I am 168 centimeters or 5 foot 6 though so a taller passenger may not agree with that assessment I really like the Practical black headliner and the hard kick plates I feel like they're always good to have when you have pets or kids around the lower ground clearance makes it easy for my six-year-old to climb in and out and the doors aren't heavy to open either which is fantastic this has isofix child seat mounts on the outboard seats plus three top tethers but it's a narrow back seat and I would be considering this as really a two-seater for regular use and a three seater only if you're desperate plus I don't think you'd be able to fit three child seats side by side anywhere the tunnel that goes through the middle of the floor does encroach on passenger comfort for the middle seat like most sedans it can be a little bit fiddly to fit a harness booster seat just like mine because of where the top tether is it's hard to get it tight however you're going to be hard-pressed to fit a zero to four rearward facing child seat if you're a tall family the storage is a little bit lean back here but I do like the other amenities like the directional air vents climate control well positioned reading lights and two USBC ports the boot offers a good capacity of 480 liters and the aperture isn't too narrow so if things roll to the back it's pretty easy to retrieve them I like that you've got the little storage pocket on the side and that this comes with some safety items like the first aid kit and a reflecting triangle in case you get into trouble now this doesn't come with a spare tire or even a puncture repair kit because the tires are run flats and because it is a base model it doesn't come with a powered tailgate but because it's a sedan it's not too heavy to operate [Music] this has a two liter four-cylinder turbo petrol powertrain with a maximum output of 135 kilowatts and 300 newton meters of torque this one is a rear wheel drive and has BMW steptronic 8-speed auto transmission which makes for smooth gear changes the engine has real kick and can go from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in just 7.4 seconds but hop in with me and let's see how it drives foreign yes it's powerful but this is actually the smaller engine for the 3 Series range I think what I like most about the performance of this one is that when you put your foot down it responds eagerly but it's not unbridled power there's no bucking at the front or shuddering through the steering wheel it's controlled but very fun this handles Corners really well with the lower center of gravity and coupe-like height meaning you can drive it a bit harder than you normally would this has the M sport suspension which means it's actually quite stiff I quite like the handling but it does get a lot of talk back from the road unless you hit a really big pothole it doesn't really rattle you but it does make for a harder ride and if you're after the Comfort or the limo like ride of other luxury models this is not the car for you the 11.4 meter turning Circle and Sleek Dimensions make this very easy to park the nose is quite long but the front and rear parking sensors and very clear reversing camera makes this well let's just say you don't have many will I make it moments the official combined fuel cycle is 6.5 liters per 100 kilometers real world testing saw my figure at 7.4 liters which I thought was really good considering how hard I drove it over a mix of urban and open road driving this has a 59 liter fuel tank and based off the official combined fuel figure you should be able to get roughly around 900 kilometers per tank which is excellent if you do Roadies like me as far as safety features are concerned this comes with some of the items I like to see on a family car and a highlight is the intelligent seat belt reminder and the SOS emergency call Button which when activated will alert emergency services to your location however I have to call out the lane departure and keeping AIDS because it does work quite sporadically and once I noticed this I did test it quite extensively this week and I do think that BMW needs to improve this on future installments this has been awarded a maximum five-star and cap safety rating but it was done a while ago in 2019 it has seven airbags but it doesn't include the newer front center airbag the full safety specs are in my written review at carsguide.com.eu if you need more details so what are the ongoing costs well the 320i comes with a five-year unlimited kilometer warranty plan which is standard for the class it also comes with either a three or five year cap price servicing plan and on The Five-Year Plan the services are just 2150 or an average of four hundred and thirty dollars a year which is very competitive for this class like other BMWs servicing intervals are condition based with the car telling you when it needs to be serviced I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in the BMW 320 IM sport this week it is bloody fun to drive and handles beautifully on the road the harder ride might not appeal to some but I didn't mind it the Cozy backseat and boot does make me think that this will suit a smaller family best and one who's not carrying around a lot of gear all the time but it suited my needs just fine if you're after the cushioned comfort of a Merc this might not appeal but I do think that this will appeal to drivers who don't want to compromise on performance but still have a kid or two in fact I kind of don't want to hand it back this gets a firm 8 out of 10 from me my kid really enjoyed being in this this week and thought it looked like a sports car he gives it a 10 out of 10. if you're after more details check out my full detailed written review at carsguide.com and I'll see you next week [Music] thank you
34;BMW;2023 BMW 320i ;Entry Level 3 Series Is One of the Best | 2023 BMW 320i Review;this is the 2023 BMW 320i and you might be looking at it much as I did and think to yourself well that looks just like last year's model and you'd be right apart from one or two small things but open the door and you'll see that there's been one very big change this is four wheels in a seat my name's Alex Dalrymple and this is the channel where you can see new cars reviewed every week but in order not to miss one you're going to need to subscribe so please hit that button down below and if you enjoy the video give me a like as well the 3 Series is probably BMW's safest and most plain looking car I mean that's partly by design it is their top selling non-suv vehicle after all but it's a Timeless design that has evolved in similar proportions and size over the last 30 years so what's new on the outside well there's new headlights the bumper is new and The Grille has changed a bit although it has managed to miss the M3s giant snout from the side there's really no mistakingness for anything other than a BMW 3 Series it's such a classic shape we've got new 18-inch Alloys this year done in bi-color alloy and they are wrapped in Michelin run flat tires the back of the three series pretty much the same as it was before with a 480 liter storage space here in the boot and under the Bonnet we've got a two liter four-cylinder turbo petrol engine which outputs 135 kilowatts of power and 300 newton meters of torque shooting this car to 100ks per hour in an okay 7.4 seconds although it does feel a little bit quicker than that in the flesh fuel economy comes in at 6.5 liters per 100 kilometers on a combined cycle and all the power is driven through an 8-speed automatic transmission to the rear wheels only once you step inside though that is where you'll see the biggest change in this year's 3 series with the all-new dashboard design incorporating operating system H which is being progressively rolled out across BMW's entire range it's basically two large LED screens joined together in a single curved display the center console screen runs all of the infotainment just as you'd expect but the previous version of this software was already class leading so BMW have had to work really hard to try and improve it with mixed results because it has now become so complicated that it can be hard to find basic functions like this home screen where you can customize your most used widgets is fantastic but if you go into the main app screen here you'll see it's just a mountain of icons and to try and find which one you need can be a nightmare the other day I was trying to increase the brightness of the head up display on the windshield it took me ages to figure it out and in the end I ended up using a voice command to do it for me just because it was so complicated and I'm wondering if BMW are actually deliberately sending us in that direction on purpose could be should you just want to ignore a lot of the apps you can of course wirelessly connect with Android auto and apple carplay as well moving down the console the climate controls that were here have been removed and put into the center console screen same as the numbered shortcut buttons that used to be down underneath that they've been replaced by some basic audio system controls and front and rear D Mister buttons we've still got this cubby here which houses the wireless phone charging a USB port and a couple of cup holders the lower console here is mostly unchanged from what it was before fans of the job wheel will be happy to know it's still here in the 3 Series you can still control the center console screen manually with this wheel plus the shortcut buttons are there too the main difference though is of course that the gear shifter the gear stick is gone it's been replaced by this little lever here that you use to put the car in drive or reverse we've got the powered park brake of course the drive mode buttons just the same as they were and under the center console all bin lid here is a relatively small storage space with another USBC head-up display on the windshield has been redesigned slightly I like it you can customize the information that appears on there just as before the digital instrument cluster is all new as well there are a few different display modes linked to whatever drive mode you're in and they all look really good I think it's actually a much more contemporary and sharp design than it used to be before the only thing that doesn't seem to be here that used to be here was maps you can no longer have maps on display right in front of you but you can have them permanently displayed on the center console screen if you like this steering wheel I'm just not a fan of look I know it's a typical normal BMW steering wheel it's in pretty much every car they make but it just feels a bit thick in the hand and it's just a bit too big you know this is such a dynamic car that's so much fun to throw around on a twisty country road but having a smaller wheel would just be awesome but you know it is what it is it's not horrible we've got paddle shifters on on the wheel as well to change gears manually if you like audio system and cruise controls are here too the seats are leather with suede accents they're very comfortable and they hug you in very tightly especially with the adjustable bolsters here in the driver's seat there's full electric adjustment and the seating position is really low and sporty in the cabin but it doesn't impede your view out the front at all I can see pretty much right to the front of the big Bonnet and there's good visibility in the rear Vision mirrors the wing mirrors are a little bit on the small side but they are okay the materials in the cabin much as they were before still soft touch up on top here we've got a nice detailed aluminum feature here in the middle and down in the lower console gets a little bit hard and plasticky underneath the Belt Line and we've got some nice leather with blue stitching here on the doors so all up a very nice cabin to be in okay let's see what it's like as a back seat passenger in the back of the three series and look it's not huge but it's doable I'm behind my own sitting position 190 centimeters tall my knees are into the back of the seat in front of me but this plastic shell here has a sort of curved in feature so there is a little bit of extra room there but I would be asking the driver if they could slide their way forward just a little bit we've got a separate zone of climate control back here and two more USBC ports a couple of air vents of course Headroom a little bit limited and dark headliner does sort of make it a little bit dark back here there is a sunroof there but well just at the moment anyway it's not really helping light things in the back seat very much the seats are very comfortable though armrest with a mechanical cup holder for two cups I haven't broken it that's good um look all up it's actually very comfortable back here this car has so much go it's so Lively and although it's been a while since I drove the 420i coupe my memory of that is that it was a little bit breathless and sort of not struggled but just wasn't as good as this this feels actually much better I was just reading on LinkedIn this morning on the BMW channel that they are actually running a competition at the moment with game developers to come up with some games that can be played on operating system eight on here on the center screen using your phone as a controller now this is obviously something Tesla have been doing for a while using the steering wheel as an input but I'd be very curious to see what BMW comes up with so well made and so solid in some ways you feel a little bit like you're driving a brick down the road and I don't mean that in any bad sense it's just it's so flat and so glued to the road that it almost feels immovable but yet it is so Dynamic around corners and stays so flat with zero body roll we've GoPro the great thing was with sport individual mode is that you can configure it to change a few of the settings around now look it's not nearly as configurable as say in M3 but there are a few things you can alter like the steering the drivetrain and the transmission select whether they're in Comfort or sport mode the change on the Driving Experience isn't as pronounced as it is in some other cars but still noticeable the suspension though is not adaptive you get what you get and it is reasonably firm but the trade-off is of course those fantastic cornering capabilities it is really quiet in here though like I can't hear the engine at all um which you know when you put your foot down you do like to hear a bit of engine noise but it's there it's just not very loud I think this car's best noise actually is when you first turn it on there's something about the sound of a BMW starter motor it just sounds so impressive that and closing the doors because they make a really nice solid noise this car also has a feature called parking assistant where it will remember the last 50 meters of driving input before you park your car so if you get into a really tight spot and you're not sure how to get out the car will do it for you released five years ago the 3 Series BMW is probably due for a bit more of an extensive overhaul but it's fantastic performance and updated Tech still make it one of the best sedans you can buy foreign
35;BMW;2023 BMW 320d;2023 Facelifted BMW 320d Review, Cost of ownership, Interior & Exterior;I'm Nikki Nash as always and today you guys join me my my latest test car this is the BMW 320d and it's a very good looking vehicle so I'm going to tell you every single thing you need to know about this vehicle from the extra look of the vehicle the internal look of the vehicle the drive and cost of ownership of the car so extra look at the vehicle as much as this is in front it has all the Chrome detailing I thought personally I wouldn't like it but seeing it in person and having lived with it for a couple of couple of days I actually like this over it being blacked out it gives off luxury it looks quite beautiful especially with those with this color I like the look of this vehicle in front in front BMW made significant changes so you get a different type of bumper design at the lower end different type of Grill but the main change is on the terms of the lives the lives look beautiful I like the the look of those kind Farms so this car next to the face live side by side preface lift owners would look at this and get helped and get hard to palpitations because of how much this cars look so good in front I like the the overall design in front at the back there's minimum there's minimal defense just the bumper where the plastic finish and I personally am not a fan of that one behind the cameras also not a fan of that so I feel like BMW could have tried a bit more in terms of making it the faceless vehicle by changing the lights although I feel like they did change their lives but they put a bit more effort because it takes a lot of people and I myself also didn't know the difference between this one and the preface lift until I saw the bumper design at the back but without the bumper I cover the bumper you all know you won't know it's the facelift until you look in front or in in in terms of the Interior when you get the nice flat screen TV inside and speaking about the flat screen TV inside time to speak about the interior and you know what for that we need to jump inside so you can see the TV screen I'm talking about so getting inside the vehicle you get this nice beautiful touch screen interface so let me put that connect my phone so you guys can see how big the Apple carplay and Android auto is there we go so you get this nice big interface you get your digital um instrument cluster over there and then there is so much you can do in this vehicle and like I said in my X1 review you need as an owner you need to find time give yourself 30 minutes of the day get in this vehicle see what it has and as you can see this getting there there is so much things you can do this vehicle and unfortunately I cannot cover that in this review but I'm gonna show you the the overall design of the vehicle in terms of how build quality is the steering wheel feels good as much as it is thicker than the C-Class I personally liked this one but I like the suit plus more because it just feels much better and it has a different type of finish here and here in the c-cloud like it's like it's like it has holes for like a better term but that's what it goes the interior but build quality the BMW feels much better the C-Class doesn't feel as good as the BMW so I like that about the BMW BMW Supreme in that regard um one thing I like that I that I missed in the X1 is the snub the snob that controls the whole infotainment system I do not have to go fiddle there although I can fiddle there like that I'd rather prefer using the swivel knob but interior it's that big TV screen what I don't like climate control system is within the infotainment system and I feel like they could have kept it here although you do get a in terms of slightly so you get like Max front or Max rear that's in terms of if it's raining and you need to demist that's all you get and then you have your your normal volume button your track selection next then you get your your hazard thing over there so that's it I wish the climate control system was fitted here as well because I do not like it being there but it goes to that it's all I can complain about in the interior the seats feel good much better than the ones found in the C Class C class I struggled with the corrective position but in this vehicle I did not struggle at all but overall interior wise for me I prefer this vehicle interior wise exterior I prefer the C-Class I've told you about the interior let's speak about cost of ownership and overall my driving Impressions then cost of ownership and then I'll tell you between the 320d and the c220 which one is a better offering and which one I personally would go for so you guys Jade me inside the BMW 320d from a driving impressions of the vehicle and I need to speak about my favorite thing about this car is The Shield efficiency so should be seeing another play video now got this vehicle at around 900 kilometers to to empty took it up to a thousand and that's something very impressive I've been averaging around four the same thing as averaging on the X1 I was averaging around 4.0 liters or 4.2 in this vehicle the highest I went even putting foot to metal this vehicle the highest you'll ever see is around a 6.2 6.7 at Max in this vehicle but I'm not so in this vehicle it's a two liter turbo diesel engine producing 140 kilowatts and 400 newton meters of torque so it's direct competitor as the Mercedes-Benz c220d that I had on test last year Link in description box below so that vehicle produces seven more kilowatts and 40 more newton meters of torque although it might not sound as much I don't know how Mercedes made got it but in this view you can feel the difference in the Mercedes that the Mercedes is putting out a bit more power so the push you do feel that you can get it in terms of fuel of the Mercedes run about the same thing with this vehicle it has a mild hybrid assistance as well so it has that whole fancy things of switching off the gearbox when the engine when you Coast it so by the end of the day goes down to perfect so this vehicle is selling point over the Mercedes-Benz for me it has to be the build quality inside and the diving abilities of it in terms of the handling it feels for me personally it feels much better than the C-Class and Mercedes-Benz is known for for for the luxuriousness of the vehicle but in that seek in that specific C-Class or the AMG line is a bit too bouncy it's a bit too not firm per se but you feel every road imperfection whereas in this one as much as you do feel the running Perfection it handles it much better Theron is much lower as well compared to this obviously like speed UPS right now I'm going in this vehicle I have I have not scraped any speed hump whereas in the C-Class I've scraped countless of times but it all goes down to way Mercedes-Benz decided to take the approach of the vehicle in terms of its looks Aesthetics they've went through that whole young S-Class Vibe but keeping it low to the ground in that instance but driving Dynamics this is where BMW claims that in terms of Shield driving plays a hands they call it they're in pleasure it's because it's so nice to drive as much as this vehicle is not a performance variant of its of its um I mean it's in its range it gives off so much in terms of the handling cornering curves it gives you so much confidence there's a as as a driver and if you keep the traction on and put it in sports and go into corners or all of that the traction assist you so much so that you don't end up losing it um it cuts in but it doesn't cut into a point where you feel like the power Cuts whereas in the C-Class the traction Cuts but at the same time it cuts the power of the of the car it cuts the power so that it can regain control and it gives you the power again in this vehicle it does not do that it manages the traction for you but obviously you as a driver you'll be doing what you'll be doing it handles that for you but you don't feel the surge of power Cuts but in the seeking the C class that happen quite quite frequently so it's something I didn't I did not like um but at the end of the day if you want to do stuff like that you just put the attraction off um but I don't recommend doing search unless if you know what you're doing but now it's time to speak about my recommendation and this is something where it's very tricky um but for me I'll tell you which one is my personal favorite between the two vehicles and then sum up the review cause the ownership and all of that and then yeah it's attempt to move on to the next segment so now we add the final part of my review it's where I speak about cost of ownership and then I wrap it up with the question you guys are asking yourself c220d or 320d um cost of ownership this vehicle if you finance it at an interest rate of 12.25 with no deposit over over a period of five years at the current at the launch price of this vehicle at 930 000 Rand before options you're looking at twenty one thousand five hundred Rand Factor fuel into that you should be paying around one four one five for a few of this vehicle so you're essentially looking at the vehicle is looking at just under 23 000 Rand but at most 20 000 including monthly repayments and fuel for the month because I do not think you need to pour another full tank when you get a thousand kilometer range in this vehicle um obviously with insurance it depends on the type of person you are I myself I know for Effective and showed this this car I will not get anything under under a thousand rent so you can easily go to 24 25 event but check out the discovery show for that then insurance for a reason tell them I send you and you get an insurance quote and then that's it so with regards to that important question c220d or the BMW 320d personally they're all going down to perfect which one you'd go for but as an overall vehicle right being biased at which one you like more aside pound for pound the overall better vehicle for me having tested both vehicles it has to be this vehicle it offers more than the Mercedes-Benz in terms of comfort which that's very controversial Comfort looks subject to Interior feel of the vehicle that's a superior even the something I struggled with in the six hours of driving the driving comfortability in terms of the seat position this is superior handling in terms of driving this is superior but the C-Class is still an amazing vehicle and as much as I've been saying so much about this vehicle I we still take the c220 because the car looks so beautiful um is where I lie towards like I lean towards the c220d but pound for pound this is a better vehicle um hence why you see this vehicle so many of these vehicles I get it um but overall for me personally c220 but I wouldn't be mad if I got this vehicle and I didn't buy the c220 so I don't mind it it's a good vehicle good offering if you as a buyer opt for this one it's good if you opt for the c220 it's good if you come to me and say Nikki will chat should I buy I will say my brother close your eyes point in the direction wherever you end up take that vehicle because both vehicles are good offerings vehicles and I have to end the review there comment down below which one you would go for since you know what I would go for and we'll take it on in the next review what's my next review um interesting next video is not on this channel it's on ignition Channel 189 all things motoring catch me at Festival of Motoring this coming weekend and yeah if you want to see me come to Festival of Motoring I'll be asking questions doing all the fun things behind the camera and I'll see you there but yeah I'm signing out
36;BMW;2023 BMW 320i ;EW 2023 BMW 320i Touring M-Sport REVIEW WITH iDrive 8 system and screen;hello everyone and welcome back to the channel where today you join me out in another BMW and this one has been very kindly supplied by the guys and girls inch Cape BMW Chelmsford um if you don't already follow them give them a follow they sometimes have some really nice cars in the showroom and they've currently got a really light cast really nice customers car uh 2002 turbo um so if yeah if you're local head down have a look uh they've got some nice M cars in at the minute new x5m yeah lovely cars but big shout out to them for supplying me with the car today do some filming on this um this very nice dravic gray 320i touring so yeah it's not it's still an M sport car but it's not obviously an end performance car so we're not going to go uh driving out as much as we do in the other videos sort of like looking the performance side of things today it's just going to be sort of looking more at the the touring features of the car and we'll still do a little bit of driving it's I've driven it out here it's quite a nice drive actually to be fair uh nice and comfortable nice and refined now being the 320i model it's got the two liter turbocharged engine under the Bonnet uh coupled up to an eight-speed automatic gearbox b h b that means you're going to get some lovely MPG figures on the long run on the motorway um even around town I think it's pretty good as well because of the gear ratios and I think it runs in quite a high gear probably fifth gear at 30 miles an hour um 184 horsepower from the engine you're not going to be breaking records on it but it's a nice little bit of poke to it if just for the people that want to know I think the notes to 60 time you're looking at about 7.8 seconds so not too bad really for the size and weight of the car um yeah it's not extra IV either it's rear wheel drive so yeah not too bad really now for the free series touring you're probably looking at just shy of 40 000 pounds for a base model but this being the M sport uh 320i touring with the dravic gray metallic paintwork because it's got a very nice bronze flake to it I really like it um and I think everything inside is pretty standard except for the black vanasca leather with the gray stitching that's another optional extra but one of the other main reasons for filming this car today is because it has the new operating system eight or I drive 8 system with the new curved display which is first come out on the some of the eye electric eye cars we've seen it in the new M3 touring and now it's starting to trickle its way down into the lower the lower model ranges um so yeah I've been playing with that on the way out so we'll jump in and we'll have a better look at our system now I'm gonna have to be quick when I jump in the car here because it you get a nice little turn and a little display on the uh the heads up display when you sort of open the car to greet you which is something new for the operating system so if we'd be quiet [Music] and that's it um just little little touches like that which makes um getting in a car a little bit nicer for the interior of the car nothing has really changed as such it's your standard BMW layout you've got the hard drive selector knob in the middle as per usual you you're all your electric parking brake there's an auto hold button which I haven't seen on any M car before so I don't know if this is a standard feature on sort of um lower spec cars um like the 320 to 340i and things like that I don't know if that's so basically all it is because it's an old Mac uh when you select when it's on it holds the car in uh so when you're in when you're in Drive normally when you let your foot off the brake the car starts creeping that auto hold feature will stop that car from creeping as soon as you let it off it will start to roll forward um so it's kind of good I guess in a way depending on what kind of driver you are um yeah the this that the layout down there is all pretty much the same the only thing I don't like is the actual gear selector um it's like a little tab now rather than a physical uh knob I guess um which I would prefer that I like a physical knob um not just so much it's somewhere to put to put your hand I guess when you're driving um but for me it's like an aesthetic thing as well I've it looks quite nice just a bit more character in the cabin I guess um with this new curved screen um this new iDrive system they're going for a more minimalistic approach and a lot of car brands are doing that nowadays I personally I'm not a fan like I just said I prefer a physical button so along this bottom row of here where your climate control settings um your buttons are normally are they're not really a physical button anymore they're more touch and now we just have sort of your next track or previous track buttons and your window screen window clearing buttons for the climate control your actual climate control settings are on this Sub menu up here you've got sort of your passenger and your driver's side dual climate settings but the actual climate control is on this Sub menu and it's all touch now my biggest bug with these and I've driven a they're even coming out on Vans now is that with a physical button you don't have to look away from the road when you're driving to find what you want whereas these new touch screens you haven't got the button to sort of locate it by muscle memory yeah other than that we've got a lot more wraps and it looks like if we go on the home if we can get there now there's a lot more apps on the iDrive system as well so as well as as well as Apple carplay we've got I've got Android auto which is new and it looks more like a tablet or a phone so Spotify is already in there as standard um yeah if we go down it just looks more more like a more like a phone app than driving settings and everything are all in there in there as well so I like the new layout it's pretty cool uh I guess it would make it more user friendly to anyone new to the BMW World um make them feel a bit more easier rather than before some of the BMW menus were quiet it was a sub venue under a sub menu under a sub menu um but I think whereas this is going to be a bit more of um quicker and easier to work your way around now as well as a steering wheel steering wheel is pretty much the same like I said it's Auto so you've got some Flappy paddles on the gear stick and on the steering wheel um but other than that everyone everything's pretty much the same now if we just start the engine um this Beastie two liter into life [Music] so again if you go through the sport comfort and Eco Pro modes the color will change of the heads up display and we get a nice red and spoke for like an angry fiery mode uh Comfort is like a nice neutral color I guess something like a beigey gold bronzy color kind of goes with the the flake in there in the paintwork to be fair and an Eco Pro we've got a nice blue now again you've got some nice funky heads up display uh we'll go through the content menu just like that we get you Maps you sat and have sort of Direction you're going in um some warnings and prompts and then just a basic Speedo down at the bottom there is a default meter which Everyone likes a G-Force meter on track I've never been a lover of Paul she's an Audi's Sat Nav where it's built into the instrument cluster I just think is a bit too much going on sometimes or it's not quite as clear but it seems like BMW have nailed it the way it sort of fitted in there and yeah I really like this it's definitely something I could use in the future now being a touring you can't not have a look in the back of the car um space wise with the same driver's position the seat left in the same driver's position that I'm in I've got plenty of room the seats kind of rested back a little bit for more driver comfort and it's not in my face um you've got some dual climate controls well sorry climate controls down here um as well as a lot more sort of Headroom in the back and where you've got that extra bit of boot space in the back before the body starts sloping down which is nice as well now if we come around to the back of the car again being a touring I actually never knew this was a thing until I got shown it this morning but the window pops open which is pretty cool for quick and easy access tuck every anything in that down there like that but then like like a normal boot electrically assisted we open it up you've got the full 500 liter capacity boot space with some small bit of understood from underfloor storage and then a nice sort of cover just to tidy up any any of your stuff that you don't want on display um yeah so little bits and Bobs like that but yeah actual storage size isn't too bad and that is pretty much all of the touring features so what we'll do we'll jump in the car and then we'll go for a drive so straight away this just being an M sport touring rather than rather than more refined there's less road noise I mean if you compare this video to other videos I probably don't filming on the same GoPro you can probably be able to tell that there's a lot less cabin noise going around like this road noise um so that's that's nice just for them days when you're feeling a bit control just woken up and on an early morning and you've got to drive to work and when the radio you can't be asked for radio you just want a bit of peace and quiet it's not it's not can't have much to talk so you can just sit back and so again driving around town and the country Lane's light I've been in Eco Pro mode um and I'll just switch it up into sport as we get into a national speed limit apart 320 eyes no sport exhaust system it's not valve or anything like that so you don't you're not going to get like an increase in noise um but put it into Sports modes with a gearbox and just downshift a little bit and you might be out here that I want to go you might be able to eat ninja snow is there's a little there's a little raspy there a little something yeah I feel it's too quiet for a while though but yeah 320i on the auto gearbox it changes nice and smoothly there's no judderiness or anything like that I think because obviously it's a smaller gearbox and a smaller engine less power you're not going to get them kangaroo in effects when driving around town so it's sort of a nice all-round gearbox um but it does pick up pretty well even in like obviously you've got your your Eco confidence sport mode so whatever mode you're in really Eco law in sport or manual shifting in sport yeah it's still still quite nice even wanting to sort of drive it in a fairly spotty manner around the lanes the actual handling of the car is pretty good I can't feel any major role in the Bodywork I'm not going around corners sort of hanging out sort of rolling around the place the chassis itself is handling handling the road pretty well but these standard seats um they're not they're nothing special they're just the standard things that you get in the car and they seem to be holding holding me pretty well now as I said at the beginning of the video this I'm not driving this car as much as what I have in other videos because I feel like this is in the car where I'm trying to put the driving performance of the car more more of the actual features of the of a touring um but I'm liking to drive in this car and I think it would make it good but it'd be a perfect daily car and it's um good sized family car as well I mean that's what BMW is good at especially when it comes to their torrents though bring that towards or is one of the best ones you can get but my little S Bends here where I currently am I test room it's off wafted through it nice and comfortable no roll you can feel it sort of take the take the bumps pretty well now I'm going to test the suspension here because there's one bump here and every end cut you saw here and there's a bit oh so yeah that's quite um we can still feel the bump obviously but I think I found out about this engine is in the low gears once she's sort of start accelerating you get a bit alone on the engine if you love The Frog here's a nice little bit of Turbo flyer which is quite funny quite cute yeah it's little things like that that I find interesting with cars they've all got their own little characteristics now with this new iDrive system it's not something that's new to the eye I drive a they've started implementing voice controls in um for the generations about I guess um I drive software um yeah basic command for it if I think I've watched the channel if you haven't back in the m135i video there was a feature where you could say BMW revitalized me and what it would do is kind of I will say aircon with you and sort of raise the volume of the music so basically if you just get tired so I think the BMW voice started coming out with these sub features now on this one as well as the driver good stuff and you can adjust the air con temperature you'd say I'm cold or I'm hot and it will increase or decrease the temperature accordingly just by voice commands now on this I found it um was that it can tell the difference between whether it's the driver that's asked for a commander or the passenger so if the passenger says they're hot or cold it will activate the Dual climate control and adjust there there side of like temperature we don't put passenger driver side which I think it's really fair and really cool um so yeah things like that people are always thinking of these new ideas and stuff which is quite cool and interesting but at the same time you think you press that button and it's done but yeah like this cool one I love technology in the way it's advancing in cars and stuff and how do you know yeah things like that I can appreciate it so final thoughts on the card I actually really like it it's comfortable it's quiet it's fairly tame um performance wise it's not too bad there's a little bit of gold there um but the economy I think is probably one of the main features why you need to get a free Twitter touring um so in my whole sort of time with the car driving when I picked out this morning it was on a 180 mile range um I've probably driven in total maybe about 50 miles by the time I all Pan the car back um bearing in mind that's been all manner of driving through town eco mode sport comfort revving it a little bit for video's sake and it's still saying 137 miles of range so it's pretty pretty bang on with the figures and I think more likely to give more than 40 miles on a long run I reckon it's very achievable so that is me pretty much done for today I'm on my way back to hand the car back to indicate BMW if you don't already give them a follow on Instagram they have some pretty they have spring or events going on from time to time and they have some nice cars and stuff as well that is very nice um yeah give them a follow let us know down below what you thought of the 320i touring and what you think of the I drive 8 system and full screen is a bit uh love and hate with some people some people feel like like I said I'm a sucker for text I like that no doubt I'll be working with them again shortly and I will see you on the next one pretty soon cheers

37;BMW;2022 BMW 320i ;Still the BEST luxury sedan? (BMW 3 Series 320i 2022 review);the bmw 3 series is kind of unashamedly the benchmark of the premium midsize sedan segment at least until we get it up against the w206 c-class but here on chasing cars we've never actually done a proper video review of the base model 320i and if the 3 series is going to carry that accolade forward of being the best in class then that means the 320i has to be pretty good so in today's video we're going to be finding out whether this is worth considering in your next purchase now this 320i starts from about seventy thousand dollars before on-road costs here in australia but the particular example we have is optioned up to closer to eighty thousand dollars it's got the visibility pack which adds a sunroof laser lights and this sapphire black metallic paintwork and it's also got a comfort pack which adds heated seats adjustable lumbar among other things that will get to a little bit more in the interior and that means it's actually a fairly expensive 3 series it's right up there with the base price of the new mercedes-benz c200 which is about 78 900 before on-road costs and it's a lot more expensive than a base model audi a4 so does it deserve to command that premium over its rivals and is this 320i with its passive damper set up any good to drive all of those things we're going to be finding out in today's video and of course if you've got a 320i or are considering one i'd love to hear your opinion in the comments section down below but if you've already heard enough about this 3 series and want to check it out some more i've dropped a link below this video where you can access the configurator see the brochure and even organize a test drive with chasing cars so the g23 series has been around for a while now but i happen to think it's still one of the best looking in the segment personally i like it more than the w206 c-class only the alpha julia takes the biscuit for me over this car but still the proportions are just right and even in this black sapphire metallic paintwork that i personally wouldn't choose i think it does a good job you get 18 inch alloy wheels and an m sport kit as standard though as a non-cost option you can choose to go for the luxury line of this 320i around the rear it's a 3 series it's the sedan as i mentioned at the top you can get a touring if you've got to put something like a labrador in the back or you need to carry a bit more gear obviously it's more practical but this sedan is what most of the buyers opt for here in australia and opening this power operated tailgate which is part of that comfort pack i mentioned earlier you get a 480 liter boot which is a really decent size but there's not that much smartness going on back here there are two little cubbies off to the side with netting but there's no cargo net and there's nothing underneath the boot floor just a battery no spare tire um yeah which is common for bmws but it is a bit unfortunate in a country like australia so you can let me know if that affects your purchase down below so the 320i probably wants the forgotten base model 3 series but now it doesn't feel that way at all now i'm going to talk you through why it starts with a technology package it's pretty much the same as every other 3 series you can get 330i m340i as well you get this 10 and a quarter inch touchscreen up here which is super crisp decent to look at nice bmw graphics and you also have wireless apple carplay and android auto you can control that through this rotary controller as well down here which is great for the bumpy roads that we have in new south wales victoria and in fact all over australia just gives you that extra little peace of mind speaking of that interacting with the car on the whole you've got this sort of mission control section down here where you've got drive modes traction control parking sensors auto engine start on and off and it just feels well thought out it's the same with the buttons on this rather thick leather pointed steering wheel which i don't love holding but it all feels in the right spot all the controls fall to hand really easily the paddles as well the indicators you know it's just exactly what you expect and i think that is why this is still the best selling vehicle in this premium midsize sedan segment it outsells the c-class and the audi a4 here in australia it's only outsold by the tesla model 3 interestingly which it was done by quite comprehensively last year but anyway we're getting off track a little bit now the tesla does bring me a little bit back to the technology package here because still a sore point for the bmw range is this 12.3 inch digital drivers display it looks fine but in the world where these things are so high contrast and so capable and interactive with the driver like new c-class and audi's digital cockpit the bmw one just doesn't have enough crispness or contrast to really offer a full experience in this car i think that's really something they're gonna have to address in the midlife refresh of this car which is probably due fairly soon actually now let's talk about the specification of this car as well because it's black outside and it's black inside hashtag boring now you can go for some different leather colors as a no-cost option with this vanessa leather you can get a really nice terracotta sort of brown color you can also get oyster and i believe you can get red as well so you can snazz this car up a fair bit but this feels kind of like you know like a salesman's mid-spec luxury car and it does a good job of that the black's obviously super easy to clean you've got this sort of tetrahedral aluminium pattern here as well which is a little bit trippy to look at but looks fine again as you know tom i'm sure would go for the wood trims which are a no-cost option you can get oak wood veneer and ash i think so yeah you could probably do that if you want to give the interior a subtle lift but what this car does have is ambient lighting and it's set to orange which is the only color for ambient lighting in my opinion so you can leave your comments on that down below whether you think that's correct or not but it's just so old-school bmw and it just has that real sense of me feeling at home in here from being in bmw products for a long time it just sort of all makes sense finally we're going to come to the seats and these seats are actually really nice they definitely don't feel like a base model car seats now some of that has to do with the options package so the comfort package gives adjustable lumbar for driver and passenger which is nice but from standard they are electrically adjustable with two position memory and they have inflatable bolsters to help hold you in on a twisty road which i think is really great the driving position is also total absolute three series down in a nutshell it feels so right long and low with the steering wheel right in front of me and i've even got my little sliding under thigh supports to give me a little bit of extra comfort which when you're six foot two really does help out so i think on the whole then i've answered the question on whether this three series feels like a forgotten bass model because it doesn't it still feels like it has a really good spot in the range at least from inside the cap the back of the bmw 3 series has never really been the place you want to be now this g20 grew a fair bit replacing the f30 but it's still not the greatest place to be like i've got a decent amount of knee room but my toes are pretty tight under my driving position and although my headroom is sort of just enough the real problem with the 3 series is that because you've got this big transmission tunnel and really high center seat it kind of is only a four-seater you can fit someone in here in the middle for shorter journeys if they're not too tall but for any long-haul stuff you're going to want to cap it at four people which is a bit weird given you know you can get the four series grand coupe and you get the swoopy koopa lines outside but as you saw when i tested that car a couple of weeks ago you don't really sacrifice any rear space so yeah i'd probably go for the 4 series grand coupe but you can let me know down below what you reckon at least the rest of the stuff back here is really nice you've got still soft touch materials back here you've got a nice solid feeling door card with a little bottle holder there flip down armrest you've got two cupholders in the middle there nice and easy to put away maybe if i can do it and then adjustable air vents and they've got their own climate setting back here and also two usb-c ports so in terms of technology and equipment back here it's really good also the seat for the outer seats are really comfortable nicely inclined backrest and supportive squab it's just that yeah not the greatest spot for five people but if you've only got four no problems the adr combined fuel consumption figure for the 320i is a pretty efficient 6.3 liters per hundred kilometers servicing is due on a conditions based model and the three series will prompt you when it's time to go to the dealer for some maintenance now a five-year service plan is gonna cost you one thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars for the basic and you can pay a little bit more to get cover for the brake rotors pads and the windscreen wipers over the last 12 months the medium budget direct customer paid 1 386 dollars to comprehensively insure their bmw 3 series now your premium may vary based on things that insurers take into account such as where you live your driving history and whether or not you garage the car and finally the warranty the bmw 3 series is covered by a three-year unlimited guarantee here in australia which is two years behind the new industry standard over five years unlimited kilometers that mercedes audi and jaguar have all moved to recently so we'd love to see bmw step up to the plate there so the base model bmw 3 series before a 320i might have been fitted with something lovely like a straight six a two liter or a 2.2 liter example but since the f30 it's been a two liter turbocharged engine and you know is that a bad thing i don't think so this b48 that gets a lot of use in bmw products is again here fantastic no issues with it it's got a really decent power band although in this trim level with 135 kilowatts of power and 300 newton meters of torque it doesn't have any where particularly in the rev range where it feels stronger and right up the top it does run out of puff a little bit compared to the more powerful tunes because of course this is the same basic engine that is found in a 330i which makes 190 kilowatts of power and has a lot more grant but do you need that power to bring this car alive not really because it's just got a really nice chassis i should also mention how smooth and silky this zf 8-speed gearbox is i don't know what bmw do but they blow everyone out of the water when it comes to tuning of this gearbox like even companies like jaguar that use the same basic gearbox can't seem to make it as silky and delightful as bmw do in here and yet when you're in manual mode shifting with the paddles it's super responsive and pretty quick like sharp on those shifts sometimes it delivers a nice wallop as you shift into the next gear and you go oh nice am i in a sporty vehicle no it's just the base model 3 series now of course it does have an msport kit and it does have pretty sporty tires on it so these michelin pilot sport 4s are a really lovely bit of rubber now unfortunately on this bmw they are run flats which goes to say why there's no spare in the boot of this car the idea is you can run on them when they're flat if you need to not recommended still and so for that reason i think they're still a bit pointless and i know bmw loves doing them it's a safety thing on the autobahn i'm sure but yeah in in practice they're a little bit stiff and i think they contribute to this car's slightly stiff-legged ride now i'm not saying this thing rides terribly honestly it's still one of the best in class but there's some areas where it just seems to pick up these little notchy bumps that you didn't necessarily see on the road and compared to some of the other bmws including the 330i and even the 420i it just feels a bit more stiff-legged a little bit more brittle when it hits a bump and i'm not sure why that is now the 330i i know has adapted dampers but i just think bmw may have skimped a little bit on the damper package for this car the spring and damper package and almost for the reason to make you buy a 330i would be the cynical thing to say i don't know do you need to buy the 330i though i don't think so not for the adaptive dampers necessarily but it does yeah you do get a lot of extra silkiness with that car and i think on balance i'd rather spend the money on the adaptive dampers and the extra money on the 330i rather than specking this car up with the sunroof with the metallic paint and the laser lights because for me that's going to be more bang for my buck but of course everyone's a little bit different but thankfully what the adaptive dampers don't mean is that this car is no good in the corners because oh my goodness the bmw 3 series is still i think the class benchmark it is such a great car to drive on a twisty road it may look unassuming in this black paintwork with the 18-inch alloy wheels the m sport kit is pretty pretty snazzy looking but yeah just the agility of this car is so surprising and the first time you get into it when it's in comfort mode and you're just cruising along it doesn't necessarily give off the vibe that it's going to be an absolute shredder in the corners but man when you get into a flow on a country road there are few cars better to be in than a 3 series even a base model 320i it just tips in so delightfully you can feel the transfer of weight from slightly front lead a little bit of understeer as you get back on the power and generate that gentle oversteer and even this 320i can do little slides the traction control is also fantastically calibrated in this car to give you everything you want and nothing you don't and i think the engineering mouse of bmw really really runs deep in knowing how to make a car like this drive so fantastically so yeah i know you hear us wax lyrical about these three series when we drive them on a twisty road but honestly the c-class has a real job cut out for it if it's going to be better than this and i know i've heard tom's chats and we both agree that we really need to get them together to do a back-to-back to see whether the w206 is finally better than the g20 so hopefully we'll have that now one thing that w 206 does have that's a little bit better than this 3 series is the safety suite now the base car doesn't get the full highway driving professional package or rather the adaptive driver professional package but you do get adaptive cruise control and a lane keep assist system and that stuff works pretty damn well it all feels nicely integrated into the driving experience just like all other bmws you've got your little configurable safety system switch as well so you can have it like how you like you know early or late intervention and all that sort of thing so that's great and i really like that simplicity of use and that sort of pervades the whole three series experience as i discussed in the cabin the thing is just so easy to wrap your head around and i guess to answer the question is the three series still the king of this segment it doesn't feel old yet so we'll have to find out maybe the new c-class will absolutely give it a thrashing but yeah we'll wait and see so that brings me to the end of driving the bmw 3 series which is always a slightly sad affair but of course as always let me know in the comment section down below any opinions you have about the bmw 3 series do you think it's been knocked off by the new c-class or do you think the audi a4 is better or something that i haven't even talked about perhaps the gorgeous alpha julia give me your opinion in the comment section down below and while you're there leaving your comments also we'd love it if you could hit that subscribe

38;BMW;2022 BMW 320i Mzanzi Edition;2022 BMW 320i Mzanzi Edition - 0-100kmh Test! - How It's different to the normal 320i | Full Review;oh my phone replying ladies and gentlemen the big question is is this car worth getting what's up ladies and gentlemen and welcome back to another video today we have the 320i zanzi edition so pretty much what's different between this one and the normal 320 is you get a whole bunch of different kits around the cop so first of all in the front we get a carbon fiber front lip which at the moment we don't have they took that off just like customers don't scrape it on speed bumps and stuff we also do have the lights that come in the kidney grilles in the front and then move to the side then we get the red brake calipers then we move alongside the car we do have the black side skirts at the bottom right over here gives the car a bit of a lower wider stones we then also have the carbon fiber mirror caps as we move to the back of the vehicle we then get a another piece of carbon fiber this time in the form of a boot spoiler we also then do get our blacked out tailpipes and it's the usual familiar 320i behind but we move in front of the vehicle over here we go inside we do also get the m sports seatbelts when we have the amazon's editions you also get your nice comfortable seats with alcantara inlay and obviously your bmw m colors and blue stitching other than that we are greeted by a very familiar three series interior very luxurious very comfortable and an absolute dream to drive another thing you get with them zanzi edition is the kidney grill lights these are little lights that are up here in the grill and you can see it at night and it gives a really really cool look to the car what we also have is an active kidney grill from bmw this means that when the car is off or cold the kidney grill stays closed in order to ensure that the car's engine heats up properly when the car then reaches the correct running temperature the fins open up and allows the car to breathe [Music] ladies and gentlemen welcome to the interior of the 320 i'm zonzi edition as a normal 3 series would be it is extremely comfortable very luxurious and just overall one hull of a car to be in and it is just one hull of a daily driver that is what someone would buy this car for you can take out no questions asked you have a really good looking car that is going to take you wherever you need to go comfortably you have a lot of space it's a big family car obviously it's not supposed to be an x-car so it doesn't have that much space but i mean for what it is it is a fantastic car it definitely has enough power to drive around the city drive around the highway that is not a problem it is just one heck of a well-rounded car and the zanzi edition just brings a little bit more spice to the regular 3 series the regular 3 series can look a bit boring and dull they've definitely been upgraded since the newest model which is the g20 they've definitely made a lot of cool interesting fun improvements over the previous generation 3 series but the zanzi edition puts a whole bunch more spice on top of that and gives you a front lip carbon fiber bits everywhere it just overall it turns the car into something a lot more special a lot more unique and something that just overall looks way better so the zanzi edition is specifically for the south african market this is not sold anywhere else in the world so if you live in another country besides south africa sorry for you you will not be able to get your hands on one of these but yo i think it's just one of those great things that have come from the country um not a lot of well it's not burned to politics that wouldn't be good so a big question on everybody's mind would be how fuel efficient is the 3 series so there are three variations of the 3 series you get the petrol the diesel and then you get your sport models which is then the 340 etc etc this is the 320i so it is a petrol car so obviously it's not going to be as fuel efficient as the diesel but the big question is how fuel efficient is this car well at the moment i have reset the trip computer since we left the dealership this morning and we're sitting at about 11.8 liters per hundred which is actually horrific i was getting about 12.8 or so in the m140r that i had a while back but you have to keep in mind that the car needs to run in this car is brand new it's got 230ks on the clock so it's going to get better and at the same time all i've been doing is i've been driving around taking photos i've been driving around city driving which is like first second third fourth fifth it does not get into eight gear which is the most efficient gear so the driving that i'm doing at the moment is not going to be in favor of field efficiency in fact it's actually in favor of comfort and pure photography-ness what's up ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the interior of the 320. we have been driving it for a while we've completed a couple of photo shoots with a car which hopefully they came out well as usual and as expected it is a very nice car to drive we've actually managed to get the fuel consumption down to 8.4 liters per hundred i think earlier i said it was 11 or something so we're improving we're improving slowly very comfortable i was just saying i'm so glad we have an automatic because my car my personal vehicle is a manual so the traffic would have been absolutely horrendous if we were stuck in that now thanks to low shedding what a what a nice car it is an absolute breeze to drive do think that the m sport logo the m logo that comes out of this door i think that is part of the zanzi package there's a point that i i think i need to make with this car it looks like a really sporty car it looks really good but this is not a sports car this car does not perform like it looks like it should when buying a car like this when buying them zanzi edition with all the extra trim with the spoiler with the the red brake calipers and everything it can be a little bit deceiving because there are no performance mods it is all just cosmetic and at the end of the day this car i suppose you could say it's raisa because it's got all the go fast mods you know got the the red brake calipers the diffuser it's all just cosmetic stuff obviously but it's got all these mods that make it look like a real sports car and make it look like it's got some some meat to it you know but at the end of the day at least the the petrol is a it's a two liter motor yes this turbo charge still just a three series it is a family car or is the car that will take you to work and back there's nothing extra that you're going to get in terms of speed and performance if that is what you think you might get with this car maybe this is not quite the car for you then you just got to keep that in mind that all the mods that the car does have they are purely cosmetic and does not add any performance whatsoever this car doesn't even have the performance gearbox so we don't get any panel shifters or anything if you want to shift manually you're going to have to use the gear selector yourself otherwise yeah it's just a comfortable car it's comfortable to cruise in the hallway um at the moment we're actually getting 7.4 liters per hundred which is not so bad we're gonna keep driving enjoy the car and let's see what happens all right so we offer highway just a little update on the fuel consumption we are currently getting 6.2 liters per hundred so it's really not bad as soon as you hop onto the highway but other than that oh it's not exactly good like i say my car okay i got a 1.6 diesel but i get about four point four four point three liters per hundred combined yeah so it's getting better it's getting better guys we are gonna do some tests to see exactly how this car performs against bmw's stated numbers so we're going to be looking at the zero to 100 times maybe even the quarter mile times depending on where in mexico we are exactly i've got my draggy set up we're just going to go find a road now and then we are going to test exactly what this car does 0 to 100. so bmw claims that this car does 0-100 in 7.2 seconds now bmw are known for understating what their cars can actually do be quite interesting to find out what this call will do considering the fact that it is not a performance car so it is not meant to do crazy numbers at the moment it is about 18 and a half degrees celsius we've got a bit of cloud cover so it's perfect we're going to go and do a photo shoot after this so the weather is just fantastic for what we want to do we just need to find a spot where we can start this [Music] all right guys so that one we actually did a zero to a in 8.31 seconds so not quite what i was not quite what i was hoping for that's not actually quick at all hopefully we will find a better set of numbers now when we tried again would take two so i'll see you when we do that let us try this again we're gonna reset the draggy oh that was much better let's see what we get there we go oh what did we get oh we didn't even worse that time i thought we did better we actually got an 8.9 second zero to 100 that time so yeah we're not exactly getting any better well we're going to give it one last one last shot okay so we're gonna reset okay one two ladies and gentlemen phone disappears come on there we go okay here we go we did it now we need to retrieve the phone somehow and then find out exactly what we did so we did 0-100 in 8.38 seconds once again not quite what we were looking for so the big question is is this car worth getting and the answer is yes it is this car is for the person that just wants to commute to work and back or go out to the family this is a family car and it is so good at what it needs to do and that is to be comfortable to be efficient to have space and it has all of those things the only problem that i personally find with this car is that it just does not have the power that i would want in a car at this price bracket i'm obviously the type of person that wouldn't go out and spend all this money on a brand new car i'd rather spend this amount of money and get a secondhand car with like 15 20 000 k's on it and get something with a lot more power get something a lot a lot younger and a lot more spirited it just feels like a good car so there's there aren't any complaints really there's nothing to complain about with this car it just doesn't have the performance that i personally would be looking for in a car but having said that if you are the type of person that just wants a car to drive around go to work and back go out to the family this is the perfect car for you i think that'll be it for this video thank you very much for watching don't forget to like and subscribe now that we have the draggy we're going to be doing a lot more videos in the coming weeks hopefully we'll get a chance to take the m4 arc for another drive find out exactly what that does and then from there hopefully the next one just keep running in
39;BMW;2021 BMW 320i ;BMW 3 Series review 2021: Best luxury sedan in the segment?;g'day i'm paul i've always liked the bmw e30 i think it embodies what bmw's about small light fun and just really enjoyable to drive this is kind of the same formula it's fairly light it's rear-wheel drive and still has that fun to drive character it is the bmw 3 series this one in particular is the cheapest one you can buy it is the 320i this competes with things like the mercedes-benz c-class and the audi a4 and i guess you could also say it competes with things like the tesla model 3 as well if you want to go down that path this is priced at just under 71 000 today we're going to do a detailed review of this car if you want to skip ahead to other parts of the review you can use the time codes up on the screen there or if you're on youtube just scroll down and use the chapters below and if you haven't done so already please make sure you subscribe to our channel and press the bell icon so you can find out every single time we drive base model cars let's talk exterior so you've got six external colors to pick from all but white is an additional 1500 bucks the only problem is the 1500 bucks doesn't really get you a very good paint job if you look closely here it's really quite wavy and you know in those back corners there you can just see that it's really i don't know just not a very impressive paint job at all so i'd be pretty disappointed if i spent just over seventy thousand dollars on this plus the on-road costs and had that paint job so anyway if you put that to one side though in terms of the design itself i think this car looks fantastic so bmw has gone off on a bit of a design tangent at the moment with things like the m3 and the m4 the new 2 series they're just i don't know being very adventurous with design and i think this sticks to that traditional form looks quite aggressive but on the same token it's still quite stylish so this one here is the m sport so it's got that m sport package you can get this in a luxury line as well which kind of gives it that slightly classier look but the m sport really just gives it that aggressive overtone without sort of being over the top now down the front here you've got these active vanes these are actually designed to stay closed until the engine reaches operating temperature that way it's more efficient and then they can open when additional cooling is required so it's all part of aero and efficiency which is why they bother with all that stuff you've got a bit of chrome around that piano black center section and then down here you've got more inlets for cooling headlights you get standard led headlights with matrix led this car has the optional bmw laser headlights we actually shot a video where we compared laser headlights to matrix led and standard led and halogen if you want to watch that video click up here we found the results pretty interesting especially with bmw laser headlights now around the side here we've got 18 inch alloy wheels i quite like the look of these so you've got that sort of brushed chrome look on the outside a bit of graphite on the inside there quite a classy looking wheel and then with the m sport package you get m badges everywhere so one on the side there one on the wheel um the brakes look kind of small this is the one thing that that i kind of don't like the bigger the wheel size you go on bmw's unless you've got an actual full fruit m car you get these really small looking brakes looks okay here with the 18 but keep in mind if you do option bigger wheels it's going to look kind of strange with tiny brakes in there in addition to that the side profile of the tyre isn't too big now this is a curious point because you can get adaptive damping with the 3 series but this particular car doesn't have it so i'll be curious to see whether this is firm because that's one of the biggest hang-ups i have with bmws they're beautiful to drive but if you're not smart with the options and you don't get adaptive damping on some models they can give you a backache so let's see what it's like when we hit the road but um i'll reserve judgment until then we've got an optional sunroof fitted to this car and if you come around to the back shark fin aerial at the top there these beautiful looking led tail lights i love that frosted look it really makes this stand out at night time 320i badge you can de-badge the car as well so generally if you see one of these on the road without badges it means it is the entry level because people don't want you to know that you've got the entry level but um yeah that is an option if you're mindful of that kind of thing two real exhaust pipes as well which is kind of cool let me know what you think of the design do you think the three series still looks good do you think it looks better than the e30 or do you think the a30 will remain one of the best looking bfws let me know what you think down there we're inside the three series let's start off with the key here it is so unlock lock is the bmw roundel there boot and then you have the diamond or what they call that that is the the rhombus i don't know what that is anyway that down the bottom that illuminates the car so you can spot where it is and down the side there you've got m badging because this car has the m sport package and then blank on the back um it's a proximity sensing key so you can just leave that in your pocket and then once you're inside you have a push button start down here now let's talk styling so being german it is slightly bland but what they've been able to do and i quite like this is break up the black with some of these brushed chrome highlights it's like an aluminium finish but probably plastic so instead of just being all black and dreary it is actually kind of vibrant and it pops a little bit there's minimal use of piano black thank goodness but one of the downsides is they've gone with this matte plastic finish and it looks okay but it just is a tiny bit cheap you can get as an option on other bmw vehicles metallic finishes on the buttons on the steering wheel and some of the buttons down here so probably an option to think about speaking of options the stuff that we'll talk about today is on this car at the moment some of the features will be optional i'll point out whatever i can that's optional but keep in mind if you are ordering this just triple check what is standard and what's optional don't take everything that i say here as gospel because it might be different in your country or even in australia where they have different package options now what about the materials around the cabin so all of this stuff here is soft touch it's like a rubber finish then you have these sort of cold to the touch finishes and then you get a sort of slightly harder plastic as you move down the cabin how soft are the touch points so over here that feels pretty reasonable and then the door's quite firm we've got our durometer we've tested the main surfaces in this cabin if you want to see how this car compares to other cars that we've tested before follow the link in the description oh by the way um on the gerometer i was stopped in the street randomly the other day by bloke that watches our videos and um he said he loved the gerometer and thought it was quite a unique inclusion so i'm glad someone enjoys that now what about builds quality actually all feels pretty decent it's all nice and solid in here um yeah pretty impressed with that now moving on to infotainment um this is the thing i find interesting about bmws if you look at all of the manufacturers out there bmw really is starting to push the game forward in terms of their infotainment systems i mean they already were but they're really going that one step further and i don't know i reckon these guys are probably second to tesla now in terms of the tech inside these cars and how advanced it is so let's start with the infotainment system it's a 10.25 inch display uh high resolution screen it is touch sensitive so you can use your finger to switch between the different menus and then what you can also do is use the idrive controller down here the top is also touch sensitive so if you are putting in navigation addresses for example you can write things in i find that a little hard to use at times but the option is there anyway you have inbuilt satellite navigation so this is uh standard to the car you don't have to then pair a phone to get your navigation running but if you do want a pair of phone you have both apple carplay and android auto apple carplay is wireless i'll show you what that looks like we'll click on this so you've got a full screen integration and if i go back here to the home menu you can see what that looks like so big screen very sharp and very quick to rip through those different menus there is one issue though uh just like other cars we've tested with apple carplay and a sort of idrive s controller you can't tap to the side like this to to get across to the other menus so if you see here i can't then jump back over here i have to really just keep scrolling through so it's a limitation of the software as opposed to the hardware so hopefully apple will fix that with a future software update let's have a look at what android auto looks like i'll click on that so also full screen integration uh touchscreen and all that sort of stuff um you will notice here when you go to the main menu that you actually get the maps as a sub menu over to over to the left hand side so i quite like that setup really nice integration on the music front you have am fm and dab digital radio you can also then uh stream through bluetooth and connect devices to the car directly and you have a 10-speaker stereo as well it's worth pointing out here when i mentioned that these are sort of becoming technologically advanced now i'll jump down to the apps section so what you can do when you buy the car you just get a standard set of apps with the car so these are the things that are on there at the moment if you do want to buy additional apps you can actually go into the the bmw connected drive store and then add things to the car so if you want to use remote engine start for example you can pay for that and have it added to the car as an over-the-air update you can then also go through the things that you have paid for so someone has already gone through on this particular car and added things like teleservices uh and the connected drive package as well so yeah this is where i was going at with the tesla thing so this is similar to the way tesla does things they allow you to do updates over there they give you that software while car's parked at home bmw is now heading down the same path and i think this stuff's really cool to see now one last thing i want to show you ahead of the driver is a 12 inch display i'll show you how that works i'm going to turn the car on so you get a whole stack of different options here on the screen in terms of what you want displayed you can configure a lot of it as well so over on the left hand side you have your fuel as a digital readout with the range time then you also have engine temperature and external temperature here and with the drive modes you'll notice as well when i switch between the drive modes the display changes to accommodate those different drive mode settings and then in the center you've got a map overlay this section here you can also change is required as well so pretty impressive setup and i like the fact that this comes standard on the entry level model so let me kill that let's chat safety equipment so you have autonomous emergency braking you have an auto dimming rear vision mirror blind spot monitoring with a little light built into the wing mirror you have a lane departure warning and a lane keeping assistant it is disappointing though you get standard cruise control but no radar cruise control you have to option that which yeah i don't know on a 70 000 car i would have liked to have radar cruise control i reckon uh parking you have front and rear parking sensors you can get a 360 camera as part of an option package but uh it just comes standard with a rear view camera i'll show you what that looks like i'm just going to start the car first pop it into reverse uh there it is there yeah quality is okay it's not amazing it's quite a sort of small display there as well i'm pretty sure you'd be able to configure it so you just get the camera but you've also got those sonar settings there so you can see front and rear as well and then this also has the park assist feature which has a reverse assistant as well if you want to see how that tech works click up here to watch a video we shot where we actually demonstrate this in another bmw it's this this feature actually is pretty cool so um have a look at that okay quick question um bmws e30 is one of my favorites let me know what your favorite three series is in the comments section below is it newer older um can you get your feedback moving on to practicality and we'll start with connectivity where you're gonna charge your stuff so you have one usb a port here a 12 volt outlet you have a wireless phone charger there for charging your phone inside the center console here you have another charging port but it's a usb c port so you do have a mixture of both which is really good um storage where are you going to put your phone so yes you can throw it down the front there for your charging or you can slide it into these cup holders up the front coffee cup now the coffee cup this morning i noticed when i put it in it kind of it's just hard to get out while you're driving because you've got to sort of watch what you're doing reach in and it's a little tricky to reach so i sort of propped it up with my keys but it does fit in there and it is secure because you've got a set of teeth in there as well that means when you are putting stuff like your bottle in it slides into position there which is nice and easy and then it fits inside the door easily as well let's see if our big bottle fits in the door no it doesn't um center console so in here the storage is pretty good it's not overly deep but it is a big storage cavity and then over here we have our glove box now the thing with this is it looks okay but if you actually try putting anything in there when you go to close it it kind of jams everything up the back there so it's not the most practical space in the world then finally you have a slot just over here next to the driver's knee for coins and keys and that kind of thing okay now let's talk comfort so dual zone climate control up the front here you'll also see this car has the heated seats as well i quite like with the dual zone they've got it integrated into this nice little digital display here then you have these metallic controls for your air vents as well and then you adjust the temperature just off to the side here so nice little setup there in terms of the driver's seat and the passenger seat both of those are electric the driver's seat has memory on it seats themselves are pretty comfortable you've got a number of adjustments you can make to them just to give you a little bit more comfort behind the wheel the wheel itself i love the m sport wheel because it just fills the hands beautifully and it just feels i don't know it feels really sporty to be driving with but it is also nice and comfortable to live with as well with easy access to those paddle shifters in terms of the steering you can reach and tilt adjust that now let's do a reach test yes easy to reach that's all easy to reach and then your adjustable controls down here are easy to reach as well okay second row this is where you're going to see a little bit of compromise in comparison to an suv you can see here that with my seat in the standard driving position which is pretty far back i don't really have a great deal of knee room toe room is pretty compromised and then getting in and out i find how to get my shoes through this little gap here um headroom is is okay they actually do a long wheelbase version of the three series the a4 and the c-class just for china i'd like to see that offered elsewhere in the world what do you reckon do you think they should let me know down there i just think it needs just a tiny bit more leg room and it would really accommodate us bigger australians in terms of other creature comforts you have a third zone of climate control down here two usb-c ports air vents map pockets you have a center armrest with two cupholders there you can see it fits our bottle nicely i'll get that out of the way this is also a port into the boot so you can get your stuff out if you need to in addition to the iso fix points on the outboard seats you have three top tether points it is curious though this center seat belt encroaches so much on the space of your left hand side passenger i'd imagine that would be kind of digging into them so yeah interesting placement there for the center seat belt let's have a look at cargo space so obviously this isn't an suv i know we always review suvs but sedans are still pretty practical in terms of cargo space you've got 480 litres here to work with the only downside is the entry aperture to your boot it's a little bit tricky to get a hold of uh beneath the cargo floor we have a battery and then off to the sides a first aid kit let's try putting our bags in and see how that goes so that top peg there i think this should fit long ways they got no dramas at all okay the other thing you can also do to expand that space a little bit is drop your second row you've got little releases just here once they're pulled you can manually pop those seats down to expand the space okay we've just hit the road in the three series let's run through the engine first so under the bonnet there is a two liter turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine it makes 135 kilowatts of power and 300 newton meters of torque now it doesn't sound like a great deal but you've got to remember that this car doesn't weigh all that much either and that means that you don't need to cram a giant engine under the bonnet but when you do that's how these things become so fast so this is a really good balance between weight management and also having a turbocharged full cylinder all that torque sent through an eight speed automatic transmission no dual clutch here so it is just a regular torque converter and it's all the better for it as well because dual clutches in these packages where they don't really produce all that much power are simply there for efficiency and you end up ruining your driving characteristics just for the sake of saving a little bit of fuel this really splits the balance there between a good driving experience and not using a great deal of fuel to begin with on the fuel front the official fuel consumption figure is 6.3 liters per 100k quickly whipped through our trip computer here we are currently sitting on 6.7 so it's pretty much bang on and that's with a mix of city and highway driving so i'm really impressed with that keep in mind as well with the fuel economy that this car requires 95 ron premium unleaded petrol in australia so you will be paying slightly more every time you fill up at the pump how does it all feel behind the wheel so gearbox first let's give this a little mash here yeah nice that is very nice and responsive so back when dual clutches were the only option if you wanted fast shifting and you know lightning fast responses that was great but now when you have advanced gearboxes like this one here where all you need to do is push the throttle down and there's barely any lag it really does bridge that gap and means that you do have a smooth driving experience all the time one of the things i'm liking here is the stop start system so i'll roll into a stop as it comes down towards zero it kicks off and then restarts nice and smoothly and quickly so it's not a mild hybrid system like you do find in the new c-class or the updated c-class but it is quite smooth and that's what i like about these stop start systems when they're not smooth i just switch them off and that makes them entirely redundant but this one is actually quite good so you slow to a stop and it just stops off the brake and then away you go yeah let's talk drive mode so you have eco pro which basically just dulls all of your energy sapping devices uh you have comfort which is just your standard drive mode and then you have sport with sport mode you can also configure individual settings so kind of pointless in this car with you know non-adaptive suspension but you can configure steering tune and the way that the engine and transmission respond as well so that every time you push that button you're getting your individual settings okay let's talk about the thing i'm really really disliking about this car and it is the ride it is way way way too firm and the problem is that you get the sporty feel behind the wheel because you know as we'll discuss in a second the steering feels great but when you go over things like speed humps and potholes and corrugations you feel everything that's going on and this is the point that i made in the intro that you have to get adaptive dampers this car doesn't have adaptive damping and as a result of that it just feels way too firm and i just don't know that that really works for an entry-level car like this it just doesn't make sense to have such firm suspension that it's not enjoyable to drive and that's how i feel at the moment it really just doesn't feel pleasing unless you're going for a blat every time outside of that it's just way too much okay let's dial it into sport mode so i can immediately feel the steering's a little heavier there roll into the throttle here oh this feels so good that's what i love about the 3 series rear wheel drive you have such good communication through the chassis and look it's got enough power to put a smile on your face but it won't sort of put you into any danger so the staggered tyre widths with 255 on the rear mean that you really get a nice hook up with the road throttle's nice and sharp in sport mode as well just kind of pushes you back and it's just a smile inducing car i know every time i've driven like a a c-class or an a4 they're nice but in base level trim they feel very base level and very soft and cushy this on the other hand just has that engaging feel to it and if you put the suspension to one side i just feel like if you found yourself on a mountain pass this is the car that's going to make you smile every single time in comparison to the competition now what about zero to 100 we don't have an official time from bmw but this is how it went up against our stopwatch on the visibility front we're used to suvs sitting up high having that commanding driving position this on the other hand you sit quite low and it's it's that sporty feel so i can see clearly down the front of the car i've got a nice head up display there with all the information i need the wing mirrors aren't huge but they give me good visibility down the side of the car visibility out the rear is good as well the envelope there of the rear window is pretty decent so with front and rear parking sensors it means parking in and around the city is a really straightforward process and then if you're not confident you can always option that extra package which adds the 360 camera and the semi-autonomous parking let's talk noise so it's not the most quiet place to be seated uh you're getting a little bit of tire noise that comes into the cabin it's most evident out on country roads but for the most part it is quiet enough it's just that is going to be the predominant noise that you hear when you are cruising at highway speeds now not that you're going to ever be doing this but just in case you do need a tow there's a 1600 kilogram break towing capacity and then when it comes to u-turns turning circle measures 11.4 meters which is pretty standard for a sedan okay bmw 3 series how much does it relate to that e30 that i like well still quite a lot actually so it feels really nimble behind the wheel it's got that rear wheel drive characteristic the steering is direct it is just the definition of a driver's car it's not soft like the c-class or the lexus is really is just a nice all-rounder but it is ultimately let down if you don't get the adaptive suspension and in this case here the ride is just way too firm this is an entry-level car and yes it has to be fun but you can't have a ride that is so firm that you just get sick of it immediately when you're in the city so please make sure you just spend a little bit extra for the adaptive damping if you have purchased one of these just make sure you tick that box before it gets delivered so if you put those things to the side it has lots of tech it's beautiful inside it's not a huge amount of leg room in the second row but for the most part it's gonna be fine for short journeys this is really the driver's pick in this segment and it puts a big smile on my face even in this entry-level form so let me know in the comments section below did you buy one what do you think of it or did you go all the way up to like an m3 or something like that let me know

40;BMW;2021 BMW 320i ;BMW 3 Series 320i 2021 G20 - 2 Year Owner Review;[Music] thank you [Music] good afternoon everyone welcome back to the YouTube channel and I just wanted to now uh finally do a review of the BMW 3 Series 320i also known as the G20 oddly known as the G20 and I've had this car for two years now I've done 35 000 miles and I just wanted to provide my feedback and review of this car and to save you having to watch the rest of this video I'll just cut to the Chase and say that this car is 100 crap it's the worst car I've ever driven or leased and yeah it does nothing well so watch no further but if you're one of those curious types then I'll continue with a more detailed explanation of why and how I came to that conclusion so I lease this car the 320i um because I was desperate for a car and at that time I don't know if you guys remember but there was a shortage of stock and I really need my family car broke down I needed a car for the school runs so I decided to based on really good reviews especially one by Mr Matt Watson who um nominated this car as the car of the year um so I thought oh Matt Watson nominated Car of the Year it's there in stock it was the price was right I thought okay fine the 420 pounds a month I got this car fully maintained uh for two years um in 2021 um so that's the story and um so I got so I got the car and I pretty much hated it from the from day one and I'll tell you why firstly I didn't like the drive I thought it was really really uh rough and not very enjoyable at all um so from that point of view I think um it just did not do it for me from a comfort perspective from a performance perspective because it's a two liter engine and I felt that it didn't give me the power as well um and um so I thought I'm not getting the Comfort I'm not getting the power what am I really getting then I thought maybe it's practicality but if you think but if you look at um the rear seats and pardon the mess but um this really isn't a lot of leg room in here I mean like you know you don't really want to spend I'm not you know uh very tall but you don't really want to spend much time in here at all um it's quite claustrophobic actually so I think because of this low swooping pillar line um you know to give it a nicer shape um they scooped down quite a lot but that does compromise on the Headroom so there's that problem um then the other thing um I don't like about the car is just generally I mean from a look and feel point of view when you get inside the car you just don't feel like it's made of any really good materials at all what I do like about the car I suppose the lights and the front look I think it does look nice from certain angles [Applause] um so I do like the front light design and I think that's what attracted me to the car if you look at the rear of the car it's also um quite a good design so I did like the lighting and the design compared to the other BMWs that were that are being made which have some really hideous uh BMW lighting design so I thought this was more Timeless but look for some reason and I kid you not for two years this flies come and sit on this car now you look on the Jag no flies what do you say about flies being attracted to what I didn't say it but look I'm not making this up so yeah there's that um now from a boot perspective I'll show you it's quite quite a deep boot and those seats do fold down and you can have a bit more space but generally whenever people get in the back leg room is very very limited in this car for the size of the car and it's quite a big thing we've put on a lot of weight but I don't know where it's gone because it's not translated into more cabin space coming inside the car which is the biggest issues that I have with this car apart from the way that it drives is um the AC issue um and then also um I don't know how this car has been designed but notice this on any G20 which is this shape of BMW 3 Series notice this that whenever the whole car is clean for some reason this area will be the filthiest will get dirtiest the first which results in two problems number one every time you have to open the boot or close it with your hands at least you have to touch it and you end up touching the most dirtiest part of the car so it comes up on in your hands that's really really annoying especially in the winters and that even if you take it to a car wash within two three days this area will be filthy and then you'll you won't want to touch it every time you need to close your boot and it's not electrically operated boot so that's really annoying the other problem that this creates which people don't talk about is that you'll see that the rear parking camera is mounted here right and it kind of protrudes out a little bit so what happens is all that crap for some reason the way the car is designed the way the car is designed and all the crap that comes up it goes in right on the lens which means that this camera looks like well this camera then just becomes very very dirty and you can't see anything out of it it's just amazing how quickly this camera then gets dirty and you can't see anything and you have to manually go out and wipe the lens before you you can use your reverse camera again getting performance I have good handling the other thing I don't know if you can make out is is this that when you're sitting in the car this pillar that comes down it really does come down over your head which does make you feel cooped in and it's just not a nice place to be the minute you pull up you want to get out of the car it's just because it it it it just is not good feng shui or it doesn't feel good to me anyway so that's another thing I don't like about this car um also um you know the car just you know it's hard to say but apart from the steering wheel which is okay um and this gear stick which leaves always uh smart you know hand prints on it because it's that glossy glossy stuff it does feel okay but it doesn't feel premium like even if you look at the seats and the leather this faux leather it just doesn't feel uh very nice in here at all so it does it does feel a bit basic I suppose it is a 320i but still um yeah it just feels a bit outdated really you'd expect more from a car in 2021 another problem with this car is I can press this button right which says Max AC and everything pretty much goes ballistic and the AC starts to work right but inadvertently if you ever hit that with well there you go and if you ever hit that with um by accident then um it will come on now if I switch it off you'll see that the AC Still Remains on so now how do I switch the AC off there's no direct off and on for the AC so you have to go into the menu of the AC and then you have to go over here and then you have to untick this and now you'll see that the AC is no longer on but if I hit that by accident again and I'm say over here or somewhere else in you know I have to now to switch that off I can't just do that the AC stays on really really annoying sorry before we set off I just wanted to have a rant about this really BMW really you're going to give us manual seats in 2021 when we had this technology 35 years ago what next do I have to pay extra for headlights because 100 years ago cars didn't all have headlights I mean like really why can we not just have electric seats for all cars in 2021 especially from so-called premium brand like BMW ran over let's go for a drive then and see um what it drives like and I'll share some thoughts while driving this car um yeah I find that um the infotainment system this touchscreen thing is just a gimmick it doesn't really work I feel like the iDrive infotainment system overall over the last four or five years has just gone a bit backwards because it hasn't really progressed as well and they've tucked in a lot of functionality into um the actual infotainment system like set embedded in the infotainment system and not enough one touch control and I think that as we get into digital infotainment systems with electric cars especially second operation should always be one touch available on the the dash or on the control panel of the car that should never be embedded in a digital menu system like BMW have done with with their AC so I think there needs to be a rethink by car manufacturers about which one touch controls they must retain on the control panel rather than making customers go into menus and then selecting those controlled embedded within menus and submenus that's not gonna work and AC on and off should be one touch on the dash as should um key other things that I'm sure you can think of The Usual Suspects we don't really want to see that kind of stuff disappearing and shriveling down and turning it into the digital menu system even if it's on a screen I still want to see one touch operation for certain things um I don't know if you guys feel about that but yeah let's take this car for a drive and then and let's collect some thoughts there when you put this car into Comfort mode it goes into Comfort mode but it's just mocking you when you're driving along um even when the car is in Comfort mode um it's really not very comfortable at all as you can see by how much of the camera is shaking that uh you know it really this is not comfortable at all so I'm not going particularly fast but I feel really as a driver you do feel kind of violated when you're driving along in this 320i um just because of I mean I you know I always joke about it if you want to digest your food have a meal and then go for a drive in this car and yep by the end of the journey you will have burped and a few times like the way you do a a newborn baby and uh you at least it helps you digest your food perhaps that's one of the many Fantastic features of the of this fantastic BMW 320i okay so driving characteristics wise um I think I suppose if I was going down the Nurburgring then I'd really like this car as a saloon it's very tight torque taught poised and cornering very precise the way it just catches a corner or distribute it distributes its uh its weight so from that perspective it's uh very very good uh uh it really does change direction exceptionally well uh but it's just the experience of of driving it that makes it very very lame um I guess problem with this car is you see even when you give it the beans it just kind of TAPS out it just it just Taps out like Conor McGregor against Habib and there's nothing really there and you're just left with this sense of want and need and uh it just takes a little bit too long to change gears I think possibly or it's just because it's just a four-part engine and you know it has its limitations so the overall experience of putting your foot down in this car is very underwhelming just kind of whistles like a little um electric shaver and and then just Taps up as I pull into my neighborhood in the last few times with this car after two years of leasing it I must say you won't be missed so in conclusion um the brmw 320i G20 model for me is a bit of a flop it's nowhere near its predecessors and it lets its ancestry down the E30 was a great car it was lots of fun to drive it had plenty of power through all of the model variants and it was a great Driving Experience this car if I was to say something positive about it is that's really well engineered and I'm sure you've heard this about BMWs before great engineering great handling great weight distribution but in the olden days or not so olden days it was also about The Ultimate Driving Experience and that's the thing that's missing with this BMW model variant it's the Driving Experience it's very very underwhelming it's very uncomfortable it's ill-equipped and they're not very powerful and not very economical not very practical doesn't do anything well it's the Jack of all trades but master of none although hasn't even jacked Comfort properly I don't know why they've got a comfort mode setting in there because it doesn't work it's not possible and I'm not on run flat tires by the way these aren't tires non-run flat normal air tires and the car is damn uncomfortable um so I really will be glad to see the back of it and um the Audi e-tron is a much better car it's competitor the C-Class is a much better car because it's a lot more comfortable and it's better equipped for the same money um so I just think I hope that the next model variant they bring more of the Driving Experience back into the three series because this car's left me after two years unable to love it I've I've kind of fallen out of love with the three series after having this for two two years and it's gonna be hard to win me back so those are my thoughts after two years

41;BMW;2021 BMW 320i ;BMW 320i M Sport Saloon 2021 Review - What You Need To Know About The Suspension!;now in its seventh generation the bmw 3 series is a car fan favorite updated in 2019 it's now 55 kg lighter and much more aggressive if you're thinking about getting one keep watching this is the bmw 3 series arguably it is the king of the executive car class especially this lou business people love it families love it and there's boy races on the slide it's got some stiff competition in its class it's got a c-class it's got the audi a4 but does the three series have the edge let's take a look currently there's four trim levels available in the three series this one is the m sport spec which is one up from entry level it gives the car a sporty body kit and upgraded alloys it's coming so now that i'm in the car what do i think the interior is typical bmw it's very minimalist but classy and everything feels very well put together and premium and sport spec gives you this sport steering wheel and 320 engines and bigger give you automatic sports transmission and gear shift paddles the touchscreen is really easy to use it's very responsive you also get some physical buttons and you get this selector which is good you get a choice all trim levels come with apple carplay android auto and sat nav you also get front and rear parking sensors and reversing camera as standard while there's not much going on in here it is still very well thought out and very practical and comfortable lots of place to store your stuff well i'm comfortable in here but what i will say is it needs an electric seat like to have one of these paying nearly 40 grand for a car it definitely needs electrically adjustable seats which you can upgrade to but you shouldn't have to that should be like a given now so bmw if you're listening we need electric seats come on standard with m sport you're going to get the heated leather seats the sport seats se pro which is the entry-level trim just comes with cloth seats and they're not heated it's about 900 pounds to upgrade why don't you quit they're free in the air for so what's it like in the back well i have to say i'm feeling pretty comfortable here the 3 series does have more leg room than the audi a4 similar headspace however it is overall roomier than its other competitor the mercedes c-class it's really practical with lots of clever space to put your kids strengths and other bits for those long journeys speaking of practicality let's check out the boot sadly no power tailgate so we're gonna have to do it the normal way with the seeks up you get 480 liters of boot space which is 25 liters more than the mercedes c-class and the same as the audi a4 price and size wise the 3 series is definitely more on par with the audi a4 but what's it like to drive so this particular model is the 320i m sport so it does have a safer suspension they'd stiffen the suspension anywhere i feel like the princess and the p in this car because i can feel every lump and bump in the road and for those that don't know if you can't tell from my accent i live in yorkshire so there's plenty of lumps and bumps in these roads i think that out of its contenders this car drives the best it's probably the most fun as well let's just see what this could do uphill and when you start to put your foot down you can feel it's like okay then jekyll and hyde mode get the foot down a little bit oh yeah it's definitely a lot of fun to drive i'd definitely be going for the 320 engine or higher i think the 318 probably won't be as fun so overall what do i think to the 3 series i'm actually quite impressed i think it's really handsome i love the way that it looks however the suspension is something that i cannot get on with and neither can my back i would definitely opt for either the optional extra which is the adaptive suspension or i would upgrade to m sport pro which is probably my special choice anyway if you're gonna be doing a lot of motorway miles the 328 or 330 d engine is a lot more economical than the petrol but they've also got hybrid variants too that are economical depends on what works for you so what do you think to the bmw 3 series jupiter ferris rivals oh are you a bit more of a bmw person let me know in the comments enjoyed this video make sure that you like the video and subscribe to my channel you can also find me on tik tok instagram and facebook see you soon

43;BMW;2020 BMW 320i ;2020 BMW 320i Sport Review (G20) - Owner's Perspective;hey what's up guys said here and today i am in the 2020 bmw 320i g20 so this is the latest three series that you can get in the market and this is the 320i sport not m sport okay this is just a sport version i drove the julia recently and then um you know this was a car that i really wanted to compare it with because the 3 series has always been known to be very dynamic in terms of driving and all that so yeah let's compare these three series and julia because to be very honest the julia is uh in this segment right i mean i drove the a4 3 series the f-30 and the e-90 and the c-class uh and the jaguar the julia is by far the sharpest so i wanted to yeah i really wanted to get behind the wheels of this car and then we can do a comparison more or less so uh michael the first question is you know why did you choose the bmw 3 series so i was looking at a couple of cars in the similar segment which is a luxury compact sedan so i was looking at cl8 the new one the c180 the w205c class i was also looking at the audi a4 is the e9 okay um but what struck me the most about this car scorpio looks like okay it's it looks as subjective but i think just the different headlights the shape the shape overall you know yeah uh quite different from the f30 yes yeah it's more of like a evolution rather than a refam version of the same car so yeah that's what i like about it and also the size i'm quite tall yeah by the way the owner is about 1.98 meters tall right almost two meters so uh you couldn't fit in the seal i i could fit in the cla in the driver's seat but whoever is sitting behind me ah the problem not to suffer is really problematic similar uh similar thing for the sea class also okay because of the roof line was quite difficult because i when i tried it out like my parents or my parents were there with me also okay then you were like really khan can't go in the back so this was the only was this the only car that you know was comfortable for everyone oh i actually didn't get to try the audi um but when i first stepped into this car i mean just the interior the size everything uh really because i was looking at decent c-class because then this was just amazing a clear choice i was looking around also but looks wise size wise everything got to test drive it also okay so this was a stand-out one this was a send out okay for my needs we've won this car for about a year a year yeah okay so how's your i mean it's not very long also but how's your experience so far uh good um no issues no issues yeah uh one thing i think is the sun roof otherwise sometimes the sun will cover okay sometimes the close heart closes halfway or doesn't fully close it's automatic right it's automatic i mean i'm guessing it works fine but sometimes just stop off with it yeah something just stops away or you will go here and then it will come back up oh i think like a sensor issue yeah but actually uh what i do is what i did is just reset the sunroof by like holding this button for about 10 seconds yeah and it works already so just once in a while do that it's not a big thing with it okay okay other than that everything else has been everything else up to your expectations what about fuel consumption for this car okay so do you drive like fast or how's your driving style oh you know sometimes sometimes young guys like to try yeah okay got it sometimes a little bit of spirited driving at 10.8 liters per 100 so that's slightly under 10 kilometers per liter yeah okay so actually that's not super good or anything large but it depends on the way i drive as well because the tank on this guy is 59 liters right yeah 59 meters okay actually if i drive really [Music] oh that's not too bad yeah i have to do the math but okay and run like yeah okay okay next like what do you like about your 3 series as i said before looks i think looks is very important for me for cars first thing first the looks i think it looks very fierce [Music] and this is not even the m spot version this is the spot trim right correct but even so i think it still looks very fierce looks very menacing from the front secondly the size you mentioned that that factored into the buying decision i think it's like a baby 5 series i've never driven the 5 series before the g3 yeah the g30 it looks yeah it looks like a baby five series yeah but the driving feel here i can tell you right now it's very different it's very very different yeah yeah uh what i like about it also is the handling you can take corners very well i mean it's heavy give it downpour now but sometimes around the corner so i can get a lot of confidence also the exhaust note yeah the stock exhaust smart exhaust police stop okay sometimes you put into sport plus you rev it 4k rpm oh yeah yeah yeah yeah [Music] what do you dislike about your 3 series nothing i mean really nothing man but if i have to nitpick when i first got the car i have to get used to all the modes okay like getting into neutral from driver from reverse you've got to be quite gentle with it uh in terms of um when i first call it sometimes when i'm in reverse i went about one push to the next gear right you don't really have to shift through that yes exactly exactly yeah okay okay but i i got used to it within the first weekend you just have to be quite gentle with it so just uh my overall i mean like first impressions this drives very differently from a 5 series g30 because the 5 series g30 is like the steering is super light like super duper light like you can turn it with one finger [Music] it's really very very light and then it's also very comfortable yeah i'm not saying this is not comfortable this is a little comfortable but just sitting inside yeah it feels like a totally different car i think because the steering is a bit heavier a way on to the heavier side not as light as an audi a4 or a mercedes c-class so yeah well but the engine responsiveness is for just a small 2-liter 180 horsepower car yeah the engine is very responsive okay slide the whole leg but you know from a two liter engine single turbo uh it's quite expected this car the suspension doesn't work the bottom like there's no bounce yes in in the suspension like it just in a way like sticks to the road yes yeah yeah that's why i meant when i say something i can take corners the car makes it like that like so in a way i can say this is a bit more planted than a four series because the four series is quite floaty it does it's like very comfortable you know which four series uh they're a green coupe you can really feel the steering like get heavier immediately yes i mean also a bit jerky though at this principle yeah yeah you can really feel the engine working hard yeah and i don't know if it's placebo but um it's more pleasant if the brake bites the biting point is earlier [Music] is this sharper than julia unfortunately no the way the car just um you know like julia is like it pivots instead of turns yeah it's like something you just have to experience then you understand it's by the way if you guys are um you know considering between a julia and a 3d series or you're wondering which one is sharper julia is sharper but this is also very good but julia is just the sensation it's just different you know it's like eating at mcdonald's you get a big mac or you get a mac spicy both are very nice very good yeah just that the sensation is different now yeah it's like that but uh i have some guys in my cargo chat will have three toy apis for sale the g20 yeah the j20 320i is about a year old okay uh one year one year one okay i think around one seven pieces 170 180 something oh yeah speaking of that you got this car last year during circuit breaker right yes do you mind sharing like uh how much you paid for it because i remember that period cars were like laylong prices yeah my coe in and of itself was only 36k 36k yeah okay you compare it to prices now now it's like 60 something six or something yeah okay and uh what was the overall car price 186 186 okay and this is a pi version [Music]
44;BMW;2021 BMW 320i ;2020 BMW 320i (G20) Review - Segment's best all-rounder, more appealing than 330i |EvoMalaysia.com;hi guys so today i'm at the bmw group malaysia headquarters in cyberjaya it's my e39 over there and right next to it is the car that we are picking up today this is the g20 320i sport [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] okay guys so this is the latest addition to the three series family in malaysia this is the 320i sport priced at about 240 000 ringgit okay so it's a good 40 000 ringgit cheaper than the existing 330i and for that savings what do you uh what what what what do you drop out from the 330i right so firstly you make do with less power it's the same two liter turbo engine under the hood as the 330i but tuned to lower outputs the 330i makes about 252 horsepower this is 190 horsepower so it's a substantial reduction there okay um and also you can see that the appearance of the car is different the 320i does not have m sport kit um but i think personally i think this this non-m sport wheels uh the design is more attractive looking than the ones they expect for the 330i now the diameter of the rims are identical to the 330i 18 inches but the difference besides the design is that the 330i being an ms uh being fitted with m sport package has the front and rear views in staggered sizing the 320i here front rear wheels are the same width so you can see here these these uh these tires two to five forty five r18 at the front and it is the same size at the back okay uh this this this navy blue color uh combo i think it looks really nice on the car it's uh it's uh it it's uh it's a it complements the lines of this car well now let me just show you from this angle uh the 320i and the 330i in malaysia they share the same headlight designs this this is the uh it's a it's a it's a pretty high spec headlight okay it's not the highest spec headlight in the lineup but it's still led headlamps led headlamps because you see the the headlight design that you typically see in the uh overseas press materials the one where the the daytime running light actually goes upwards right uh those are laser head lamps and they cost a lot more this is the next step down from laser head lamps still pretty high spec leds um of course i said this when i reviewed the 330i i think what bmw could have done is that they could have give given these headlights uh a bit more of an expressive design because right now right when you when you switch the car on when you drive it the daytime running lights just this this this lines here uh looks a bit underwhelming now this kink here this is an homage to the e46 okay where where the the lower edge of the taillight also is uh has this kink okay but this one is a lot sharper it's almost like uh like the sharp you know the the shark fin that hey you know that that that's maybe an indirect tribute to another uh bmw old bmw uh design queue you know the old sharknose bmws maybe that's a sort of like an indirect tribute now um you can see the the the low the bumper here uh compared to the m spot bumper you can see a lot more painted surface okay this this is the led uh front fog lamps and it's encased within this t-shaped uh surround okay trim surround overall is a very simple very understated uh front bumper design now let me just bring you to the back now here you can see here the side there's this sort of like artificial extension to the window line okay to to accentuate the hofmeister king effect but personally when you uh you ask me when you look at it from the inside here the natural shape of the door it's already you know has a very pronounced hofmeister king effect so i i i do not fully understand uh why why they had to do this to to to you know to further um enlarge the the the glass area okay so at the back here the you can see the uh the lower edge of the bumper there's this gloss black trim element here okay and you have the exhaust pipe either side okay one two okay this used to be an exclusive design cue only for the six cylinder model upwards with the f30 right if you see tailpipes like this it's either the active hybrid 3 or the 335i the 3 liter 6 cylinder models but now this one 320i 330 upwards all have this one uh one exhaust on either side and you can see here the the rear reflectors also encased within this shade the same uh t-shaped uh surround trim okay um 320i wood badging here sitting just above the uh the tail light before this prior to this with the f30 e90 generation this batch always sits uh inside of the taillight now with the uh g20 g30 generation they they are okay perfectly okay with the batch sitting just above the taillights so you get a reverse camera here good okay let's open the boot nice boot right 40 20 40 split folding inside here got further hidden compartments under here there's a 12 volt socket okay uh hidden away from view and here also another compartment here with uh the this is the uh first aid kit and down here open this is the toolkit all right so they no longer put the tool kit here like they did in in this car all right so manual closing now before i show you the inside of the car let me just tell you that there are many ways you can lock and unlock uh the three series and and also bmws today in general so firstly you can program your phone to be something like a virtual uh key to the car but that requires intervention from the dealer downloading apps into your phone and i'm not gonna go through that with you today so uh this is the regular key four okay this is the regular key for uh this car does not come with the with the uh that the fancy screen all right the fancy remote with the screen that we saw it with the g30 so you have this uh standard key fob and the best part is this check this out so as i walk okay i'm not pressing her as i walk pay attention the car unlocks itself so it you i mean you can deactivate this feature if you don't want it but it's there so this is bmw comfort access 2.0 it detects you approach the car and it unlocks itself as you as you approach now uh as you as you move away from the car see the side mirrors full it has unlocked itself i think i've demonstrated this during the uh during the x540e preview so here is it again in available in the 320 i own oh check it out that's a toyota 86 relatives by marriage all right so this is one thing now the other thing okay the other way to lock and unlock this car is this little key card so this is just a simple nfc card so uh it doesn't it's uh what you do is on the driver door there is an nfc reader okay let me just show you all right so unlock the car now then you get inside so you drop this key into the nf into the wireless charger here and start the engine as per normal brilliant right so there are there are several ways you can you can uh get in and out and start this car and deactivate this car so you have the traditional traditional uh keyless entry all right which you use it like you're all your normal keyless entries or this this card personally i think this is very useful because uh say for example you're a lady going to fine dining you carry one of those small little purses this fits nicely into your wallet or say you're going for like even me as a man uh i go play my futsal play my badminton this slots nicely inside my wallet so i have one less bulky item to carry around okay uh which i think i think this is this is this is great okay or or even better program it to your phone thoros one item less to carry right brilliant so now let's get inside the car and check out the interior because uh it's also damn hot now so i'm gonna start the car again um compared to so is the first thing you notice uh compared to the 330i it doesn't have that fancy uh instrument cluster all right that doesn't have that it is this is a more traditional looking uh analog dial all right it's it's backlit so when you're off the engine uh this th this is a whole black panel but inside there you can see this is a physical dial these are all physical dust but just cowered in the panel and with all the displays of put on the surface so it it has a sort of like a virtual instrument cluster look but this is a far more conventional uh it is a conventional instrument cluster behind the only uh screen area actually is here okay uh all right so you can you okay so here's the bc button now this this kind of interface is a bit more familiar coming from that old school car over there okay um right so you can you can see here this is the uh the the cruise control uh system now this particular unit i'm driving here this does not have active cruise control it does not have auto braking but for 2020 bmw malaysia they have upgraded the g23 series and a few of their other models as well to include auto braking so those of you guys who have been complaining on the comment sections uh in forums on facebook that bmw has not been taking care of safety features well they have hurt you and from 2020 onwards the g23 series and a few other bmw models they have they now come with auto braking as standard okay so um yeah so here you can see this is the this is the button to in to interface with the with the uh digital display there all right so there's this scrolling knob here nice because you got a nice uh those nice patterns on the surface the um tactile feel of it is good all right but uh and overall i would say that if you compare this cabin uh now this this definitely in terms of the build materials the qualities um you can see that this is a spec down interior compared to what's available right at the top so you one eye you can see that you know somehow this cabin does not come with the best of what the three series have to offer and let me just point out why so example this panel you know that some uh somewhere out there somebody who paid more money this is probably in a nice uh brush metal kind of finish same with that speaker uh plastic speaker panel there okay uh in and you can see that this i drive screen here the real estate occupied by this screen is smaller it's only a portion of this whole whole piece so um and and uh and and you can see the steering wheel here also uh it's a bit more bare looking compared to what we had in the in the 330i uh and yeah some and also here you see the the door card the door card also it's just one c of of of gray although the the the materials used are of different textures you know from top to bottom but i feel that they could have they could have given it a you know so like a combination of contrast colors to layer the design to bring out the contours of the design now one thing that i have to comment is the lock and unlock button so they put it here for the driver that's fine what's not fine is they don't have that one over there in older bmws like my e39 the lock and unlock button is placed in the middle somewhere along here so uh let's say like when you go out and tap out food when i go and tap out food my wife was sitting down here she can unlock the car from her passenger seat but now now in in my case if i were to go there and tap out food my wife who's sitting here she would have to stretch and reach for this button okay uh quite obviously uh this button is a cost option in other markets and uh it's it's sad that it's it's unfortunate that this is specked out uh i think i think what bmw really should do is to either spec but the buttons both side extended or relocate the button to the middle in any case there's the real estate here for that anyways okay um yeah so now now that we are here at least you can see that you have this pleasant uh metal finish here on this and it has a surface texture so it's nice to touch and you pop this okay there's a soft uh soft opening okay excuse my e39 key and here you can see there's a usb port here 12 volt socket this is the wireless charging tray it's rubberized the surface is rubberized so uh so if i dump my phone here it doesn't move about and it automatically charges so here this this this is the cur the latest generation bmw i drive slash gear selector panel um so engine start stop button here you can see this button one touch you can immediately select sport comfort or eco pro all right this is the i drive i drive uh panel this section is the idrive panel so good tactile feel all right the rotary control knob bmw really has perfected this and now as you can see right um as you as you look at the the screen on display you you really see how they shrink it this this space here this space here to me this feels glaring do they have touch yes they have their enable touch that's good so obviously i wouldn't count on gesture control being here yeah but but this this tile this tile uh interface is nice okay certainly no complaints it all works well and what else so you can see here this is the center console box usbc port there this is lit this is the lighting and uh curious to know why is this step here i don't i don't fully understand why but it's there okay uh and yeah so let's go to the back now come to the back seat full okay this this is amazingly spacious for a three series this is brilliant okay enough more than enough space for me to cross my legs uh you've got rear single zoom climate control two usbc ports and a 12 volt socket here aircon vents let me just check out the uh rear armrest this is the standard bmw template armrest and the uh the rear middle passenger has a has a two buckle it's a two buckle seat belt but i can't find okay so this is the the uh the the secondary buckle for the middle passenger all right and and so you have here isofix mounts okay so this is a uh this this flap lifts up it's hinged here so you don't have to to pull it out and don't and look for space to to slot this now where is the release latch for the 60 40 split folding i'll explore that later okay so you've got three individual adjustable headrests here and [Music] yeah and and and i must say these this this is this is fantastic accommodations here at the back all right so i've got good head room uh good lean angle fantastic tight support i think this is the best real accommodations i've ever seen in any generation of the three series lovely place to be here i mean it's not it's not a seven series kind of plushness but it's a very very comfortable place to be in right very spacious nice now i'm just going to come open the boot again and yeah so i'm going to unlock this just drop the seats nice so you can see here uh lovely okay uh this is so you see here the boot it rises up here okay the the floorboard rises up to meet the seat back so that it creates a seamless floor okay right all right so here you have it this is the uh walk around interior walk around full interior and exterior walk around off the 320i we're going out for a drive but before we go for a drive i'm just going to show you here the the lightning signature a bit underwhelming right they should have had this they should have made design this led headlamp to resemble the laser lights uh lighting signature a bit more closely in my opinion okay so uh time to go for a drive now the thing about the 320i that uh that immediately you notice especially after you jump from the 330i is that this is nowhere near as fast i'm not saying it's slow but uh if you compare to the way the 330i bolts off the line uh this the 320i here actually seems almost pedestrian by comparison it it is the acceleration that it delivers uh it's it's it it comes in more in a more measured fashion okay uh it it doesn't snap your neck as much as the 330i but make no mistake this thing is still properly fast and you know in any context 190 horsepower for a car this size is not what we would consider slow at all okay um certainly i mean if you have especially if you are coming from an e9320i with the lethargic two liter 150 horsepower engine this is easily a three or four step up upgrade so what you have here is that in terms of performance the 320i is not blistering like the 330i but it offers more than adequate performance all right it it gives you more than enough punch to sprint from traffic light to traffic light and what i like about it is is that the overall acceleration it's is its smoothness the power the whole power train uh and transmission combination is just very very smoothly executed and you still can pull it to the red line with a fair degree of enthusiasm okay it's just not explosive like uh like it was in the 330i now the other aspect about the 320i which i which i personally think is far far more appealing makes this a far more appealing uh day-to-day driving prospect than the 330i is the ride quality now um i think i remarked before in the 330i the ride with the m sports suspension it's just harsh it is a very firm riding car that uh i'm sure it will do fantastic on the race track you know you do it you take it on sapang you probably could be able to nick a decent lap but let's say like out here on putrajaya where somewhere occasionally you have a not as well surface patch of road that firm suspension runs the risk of bouncing you off the ground whereas here with the 320i uh because the suspension has a bit more pliancy to it uh it keeps the four wheels in contact with the ground more consistently and as a result you are able to deploy the car's power with more confidence and assurance so in real world terms in real world terms um you know once you you drive it in less than perfect conditions the performance gap between this and the 330i becomes noticeably smaller and you see like right now i'm taking this cloverleaf band so there's a bit of body roll here but you know it's well managed it's just about well managed enough that it gives me the confidence to push on to keep my foot firmly planted on the throttle and now as i as i as i go on these wide open roads here in uh in cyberjaya putrajaya i hardly find this car lacking for pace at all i mean given a choice as a day-to-day uh day-to-day package right as a day-to-day companion this is easily easily a superior uh superior all-round package than the 330i right it's to the point where right let's say like even if i have that budget of 280 000 ringgit for the 330i i would still go for this instead and you see the other thing right last time back in the days of the e90 the f30 choosing a 320i not only gives you lesser performance it gives you very bad cut levels of equipment it's it's you know it's not the kind of thing that is the kind of thing that you you you think hey how can a 240 000 ringgit car be missing this but here right now here in this 320i uh yes i'm looking at a smaller infotainment screen but the other aspects of it i i lose out on the digital instrument cluster from the 330i fine with me because i think the analog cluster here looks way more pleasant that's one thing uh i lose out on the m spot package no problem the standard the standard uh the standard body looks fine the is and in all honesty i prefer the design of these rims versus the m sport rims all right and you you still get keyless entry you still get reverse camera which is which is of a fantastic resolution all right what is there to ask for and and also the ride in this car is so much more pleasant than the 330i all right that that all around whatever aspect that you look at it you know be it you know from a price point perspective from the level of from an equipment perspective from a performance perspective from a driving perspective everything adds up in favor of this i would go as far as saying that within this segment within this price bracket this 240 250k price bracket there isn't a better all-rounder than the 320i here i can absolutely find no fault with this car whatsoever so guys if honestly if if you are looking for you know if you are if you are shopping in this price range all right and if you come to me for recommendation for a car sedan car at 250 000 ringgit price bracket you don't have to ask me anymore don't have to drop me a line on facebook anymore because this this will be my default answer [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
45;BMW;2023 BMW X7;LOOKS CRAZY! 2023 BMW X7 Review;foreign Jacob and we're going for a drive [Music] the refresh 23 BMW X7 xDrive 40i without launch control [Music] it's not even the 6D no [Music] that's good we're spouring dark 375 horsepower 398 pound-feet of torque from a 3-liter turbo inline six cylinder with a 48 volt mild hybrid system I'm gonna put it back to Eco Pro in honor of the mild hybrid system okay fine okay I want to talk about the looks first because yeah that's what the refresh to me shows they got the different headlights very different no more traditional BMW circular things I don't mind these at all I actually like the look of this I think more than the previous version unless we're talking about the Alpena xb7 which uh I think I like more just because the cool wheels and everything and I like the previous one a lot better however I don't actually mind this one anymore after letting it absorb in my mind for like a month and then looking at the rear end we got slay different tail lights with cool designs and stuff in there I love them I really I think they did a great job with that yeah and then uh from the side it's pretty much the exact same car but we got this cool paint which I'm pretty sure is the exact same from that Supra it does look similar from what I saw in your video yeah so uh shout out Supra so Toyota colors and the next thing I want to talk about if we move inside some stuff has been refreshed things that I usually don't like in newer BMWs is this new infotainment screen where we're missing the one to eight favorites and no hard buttons for your climate yeah and then we have that big one piece center screen which is actually two screens which looks nice yeah I got updated Graphics in the infotainment and then we also have some updated ambient lighting with this X7 thing which changes with the ambient lighting colors and the stuff I think when you get like phone calls so that's pretty cool and in this particular one we also have some really nice looking wood grain not too old people-ish this is like pretty modern yeah you could get away with it and I really like this pattern where the weird looking vents are yeah manual control but they're getting close to Porsche territory yeah yeah but you can still touch them I think it looks pretty premium and I actually do enjoy that and the best part of this interior that I must mention you might have seen at the beginning of the video our newest sponsor tuxmad tuxmat is the ultimate car format for everyday drivers their car mats offer the maximum amount of

amazing yeah okay cliche Corner rip oh okay oh rotates it's pretty good it's just normal good BMW even though I'm in a comfort mode because sometimes you know you're flying around you need to rip a corner there's no time to yeah it's uh it's definitely a little body rolly it's also adaptive air suspension as well so I kind of expect that you think it drives better than the Telluride or Palisade through there honestly kind of no no they have more power but maybe like handling not as uh yeah it didn't it didn't feel as cohesive and the Adaptive air suspension is really comfortable just like the previous X7 was I have no complaints about the ride quality as I really shouldn't in a BMW because this is very expensive okay another nice thing about driving I guess is kind of considers Quality quality of life is the radar Cruise Lane keep assist it's like the old one you still get all those features the traffic jam kind of stuff but I feel like this one doesn't sway as much left and right like the Alpena xb7 did because this is a newer system so that is a great Improvement yeah I believe the system has been updated because this is a refresh it's an LCI but still not as nice as super Cruise in that Cadillac Escalade that we drove down to Pittsburgh for the Corvette thing but there were a lot of sections where the super Cruise wouldn't work where this does work so yeah shout out BMW I guess yeah uh I mean everyone's got their systems every system works a little bit differently and each one has its own advantages all right and then I got another silly thing I want to point out that this has you know how I love the reverse mode that automatically backs you up up to 50 meters and BMW's now we got up to 200 meters going backwards and on top of that we can program a path forward okay and then when you get near there it'll be like activated yeah and you just drive onto this imaginary line or whatever and it's like you're on a slot car track and it actually works really well I think it'd be good for weird parking situations but I don't know if it would work underground because I think it works off satellite locations I think it's a good feature for bad drivers I personally would never use that feature but it's nice to have I guess like if you go down that like narrow driveway that I did at my dad's house in the X5 like that would be cool you could probably reverse through that like you just don't have to think yeah I like to think yeah but you don't have a crazy tight driveway like I do sometimes trust me trust me bro it's a good feature but another feature that you typically like this particular model does not have is a drive recorder yeah yo what the heck what the heck well at least I can't program it to my shortcut there and I can't slide it down here it's like yeah it's all touched it's an expensive car give me the drive recorder and then I watched a BMW video about this and they were saying how it's like and with less buttons available you now really benefit from the intelligent personal assistant saying like it was a good thing and then uh yeah so this voice control can't get you to your SiriusXM channels like hey BMW play SiriusXM channel 9. unfortunately the vehicle is not equipped with that function but it is equipped with uh salary radius I'm like well what the heck yeah weird but it does have a remote start okay well which which is quiet activating the infotainment because there's a warning and they've got a cool new key fob and which shows three clicks turned on which very very very very the key is an improvement from the previous key all right your turn to drive Let's Do It Don't Clap oh look at these tux mats look at all the coverage on the side more than I'm not going mad much more very cushy for my heels they are nice though really nice really nice what do you want to do launch control I got to set up my seat first oh it doesn't go as low as I'd like it to oh yeah the massage on I forgot about that put on your heated seats put on your heated steering wheel put on your heated armrest I'd rather not do any of that right now because I'm gonna have to think too much yeah I like to think sport mode [Music] all right oh yeah that was good that is a really good launch for not having official launch control for not having a 60i badge yeah exactly we're not having an X does it have an x no it's an X drive because it's all-wheel drive I'm at M yes uh so powertrain is basically the same one that they've been throwing in everything recently the three liter inline six cylinder which is really good I do like it here the 48 volt again don't really feel it much but you had some complaints about the brakes yeah okay so up to the stop sign like slow down and then like I'll rip it and then I'll go gently to the stop sign a little bit slow but it's the transmission the zf8 speed is really smooth okay so now I'm going to slow down like a normal person would okay let's go right here and yeah there's yeah yeah okay now try this put your foot all the way it's harder to be smooth put your foot all the way down yeah and now pull back slowly like don't you feel like there's like a whole bunch of like dead zone stuff a little bit it's a little bit weird I wouldn't call it a deal it reminds me of the Ford Maverick hybrid that we hated that like this is like deal breaker-ish to me I just don't like it at all but I do like this powertrain it is much improved in terms of horsepower and torque from the previous generation well from last year's model so that's really nice to have uh zf8 speed like I said is really smooth it's not that quick you can use the paddles you can use this Crystal shifter thing because we no longer have a massive stick shifter so yeah you put into manual and then it'll automatically upshift which I expected to so here [Music] but it's smooth which is really nice Graphics are nice yeah uh Drive modes we got sport we got sport individual you can also put in a comfort Eco Pro and that's about it I think we have comfort individuals as well or is it Eco Pro individual yeah you go pro individual and then the graphics change your gauge cluster changes don't really love the gauge cluster it's kind of this new BMW away so this is the way that it's going to be you got the head up display that looks like a spoiler and stuff yeah it's like wings going back and forth but yeah this car drives really really well super comfortable love the Adaptive air suspension we also have the optional four-wheel steering on this so in parking lots and stuff like that it is quite noticeable so there's this optional subscription or optional one-time payment uh I don't know Yuri I think it's actually just a one-time I'm getting confused between my BMW and Mercedes okay through cliche corner and yeah I mean this thing rips pretty hard pattern score mode than it was in Comfort yeah I think the suspension definitely tightened up and yeah it feels pretty good don't send this in Eco Pro like Yuri did but I do want to talk about the looks a little bit more specifically the grill I think it's actually sort of appropriately sized for this model I'm not upset by this Grill oh it's been the appropriate size to hold I'm still going to photoshop so I get more clicks on my BMW thumbnails but like since that first X7 it's been the right size I don't love the headlights however the Grille on this one for 500 extra dollars which we definitely check that option box it lights up and you can set that up while it's parked or something but sometimes when you talk to the infotainment it'll tell you that you don't have it yes hey BMW turn on iconic Grill hey BMW kidney Grill lighting can only be deactivated when the vehicle is stationary and the engine is off okay I think it's like when you start the car thing but not while driving pretty specific but all right whatever so we do have that feature uh what about the visors inside three two one they pass we need them today and just like all BMWs cup holders are great in front of the shifter area and they'll fit a small medium whatever large it's got heated cooled Cup holderness and the crystalness is actually an option which I mean I really like it they've got the the area for your phone and I guess you'd have to put your phone there as well if you're using your phone to unlock and all that kind of stuff oh yeah because this has like a phone as key as a feature yeah it's got all that kind of stuff you can connect to the app and everything which is like nice BMW stuff but I didn't log into the app this time no and then uh rear seat room is quite good because it's an X7 we had a bench before or no usually we have Captain shares I don't recall but if you look at your leg room and look at your feet we got some nice talking yes we do full coverage more coverage than the little ones that came with it and what's cool is on certain cars I got my CX-5 it comes all the way up against the back so if you have muddy boots and you hit your heels against the back it's not going to mess up your carpets on your car exactly and then this is also a three row SUV uh it's okay in the third row that's all I'll say sunroof up there though yeah luxury the trunk room behind is like just enough for carry-ons but if we fold everything down lots of room and then in the front here these seats are very comfortable no issues we do have massaging as well as an option and then we have adjustable bolsters I love these seats I love these seats you know uh you said the m340i you couldn't get yourself comfortable in there yes the second I left I the filming I realized like I couldn't get myself comfortable and the brake pedal so just like a little bit more time but these are lovely these are great and then uh the back has peasant blockers oh yes electronic as expected in a BMW got the cool like ambient lights in the roof and stuff too yeah inside's really nice uh also back to the outside the wheels they're 23 inches for the first time officially on a BMW but I believe the Alpena ones are also 23s they look really really good and I love like that combined with like raising and lowering it how you can get it just looks so perfect The Stance is 10 out of 10. and today just for fun instead of a continental recommended tire what do we want to do go to continentaltire.com the straight pipes check out your Continental recommended tire and there's currently a promotion for a 70 Visa prepaid gift card which includes some summer and winter tires check out continentaltire.com straight pipes for the full list and full details get your winter tires on your car right now by the time you watch this it might be borderline too late but it's never too late go to the shop and get them yeah and there's even the new extreme contact sport zero two which is a brand new tire that is officially launched that is also included in the promo before we get the price is another cool thing I want to mention so we've got our parking assist button but then there's like a blank yeah because I think it was a different parking button and they kind of made it all into the same button into the same parking mode stuff oh because one would have been a camera one would have been an assist like all like in there and it's all nice 360 camera stuff okay I really like it no it's just that I I do miss having a place to rest my hands still because now I'm not I'm just serious I missed the one to eight buttons yep so let's get to the price hit me with the price this one starts at 108 500 Canadian and this one is optioned out to 130 250 dollars it's not even the 60i no that's a lot of money already so then would you take this over and Escalade with super Cruise because I'm thinking I go escalate I go to tsb.truecard.com get an Escalade instead of this I mean I really like this I would definitely consider it see the kind of deals that you might be able to get on this I do like this more than the GLS we did a comparison last year or two years ago with the pre-refresh of this so yeah I mean I really like this SUV this or an eqs SUV Yuri the eqs SUV is dead to me I love this thing especially in comparison to the Mercedes electric stuff and we are going to hopefully one day do the i7 the electric BMW 7 Series and I think of that is the eqs killer oh that reminds me in the back seat we don't have rear infotainment anymore but they have Clips so you can use your iPad or whatever mobile device because that's all we really want in cars yeah so let us know what you guys think of this refresh LCI lifecycle impulse vehicle X7 thing does it look better than the previous one yeah yes and check out tuxmat.com thank you so much for sponsoring us and supporting our sponsors guys keeping our carpets clean yes [Music]
46;BMW;2023 BMW X7;New BMW X7: A Range Rover beater?;this is the heavily revised BMW X7 and never before has it been such a dramatic change in look since Adele lost all that weight now in this video I'm going to tell you about the changes BMW have made to this car talking to the exterior the interior see how practical it is take it for a drive and of course I'm going to launch it to see how quick it is from naught to 60 miles an hour because this is the range topping M60 version and I'm Matt Watson and you're watching car wow Buy sell car wow so then what are the main design changes BMW have made to the X7 well at the back they're giving it some new tail lights which are quite shapely also a redesigned bumper this being the m60i has an even more aggressive rear bumper and look quad tail pipes these are exaggerated surrounds but within there are real exhaust pipes which is a good thing moving down the side alloy wheels now start at 21 inch in diameter as opposed to 20 for the pre-facelift version and go all the way up to 23 inches this M60 model gets M door mirrors look whoa thistleable and M badging there and what looks like air breathers though they don't breathe in here they're fake biggest change though is here at the front it's quite different to the prefaceless version isn't it massive massive change most noticeable the headlights where they're split I much prefer this new design you still got a big grill but the bumpers have been slightly tweaked and on this M60 version obviously they're more aggressive I mean look at all these intakes and stuff like that and you've got your that and it also gets black accents instead of silver now the starting price of the X7 is 85 000 pounds this one though 115 000 pounds now you can save an average of five thousand pounds off an X7 through Carlo and if you want to see all the latest car deals click on the pop out banner up there or follow the link in the description below to go to car wire you can also sell your current car through car while you just upload some photos give a brief description then dealers all across the country will bid on your car it's dead easy now if you want to do all that at a later date just simply Google help me Carl wow and we will help you change your car BMW has reworked the inside of the X7 as well so you've got a slightly redesigned center console with a new smaller gear selector rather than a big knob and you get the crystally bits as standard all very nice another big change though the infotainment screen which is one big curved display like you get on the I4 and The IX and they've upgraded the infotainment system itself as well now to tell you the truth I do prefer the infotainment system on the Mercedes GLS and if you want to see my full in-depth video review of that car click on the pop-out button up there for the link in the description below now you've probably noticed the air vents are a bit different not sure about these directional controls look a bit tacky also there's this logo on the dash now which on this M60 has an M on it speak of the M60 also gets an M sport steering wheel with M logo and M stitching you get M on the display and M dials as well you also get M stitching here on the seat belt plus M on the kick plates all very very nice quite in here yeah very good lovely leather as standard on this M60 you get like black here but this is the upgraded optional carbon fiber storage is pretty good the glove box that would be a decent size if it wasn't for the fact that you have these little air fresheners in here look oh not sure about the smell of that smells like a Musky deer if you even got heated and cool cup holders how luxurious is that door bins are large as well Plus you've got an electrically operated steering column that true feeling of luxury but is it as luxurious in the back seats let's find out here in the middle row of the X7 there's absolutely loads of Headroom knee room that's all right and this seat is in as far forward a position as it can go because actually I can move it back electrically look at that to create even more knee room and I can recline it as well look for added Comfort but really there's enough space with it in its most forward position which is better for people in the rainbows row which I'll show you in a moment also it's quite a wide car so you can fit thread UPS across this center row no problem at all and because the back doors open nice and wide it's so easy to get in and out of and to install a big bulky rear-facing baby seats plus the isofix anchor points are dead easy to get to there's some other nice features as well such as these airplane style pockets on the seat backs you've got your USB in there as well Clump control in the back more USBS down there big door bins huge rear windows you've got blinds to the rear windows integrated into the door keep prying eyes out and look at this this particular version being the M60 he has an Alcantara headlining for added loveliness plus yeah you get the M logo on the seat belts even back here let's check out the room I throw do you know what it's really quite impressive back here Headroom is good knee room that's all right and this seat is in a position which has adequate knee room for the person in front there's an all right amount of foot space and you can just about slide your feet underneath the chair in front though it's better if you sit in this seat because of the way this seat splits 60 40. the seats themselves are quite comfy and they're not too low to the ground like they are in some other seven seaters so you have a decent amount of under thigh support there's some other nice features back here as well for instance look you've got your USBS there you've also got cup holders big Windows there's isofix even back here and look at this you've got your own climate controls and the best bit of all your own sunroof in the very back there's one thing that's missing back here the m60ness doesn't extend to the very rear lock on these seat belts no end stitching anyway let's move on to check out the boat one of the things I love about the X7 is that you get oh yeah a split folding tailgate always call those give you some places to sit anyhow with seven seats in place the big capacity is 326 liters which is actually pretty big part of the reason for that is that you have some underfloor storage there quite a lot of it that's cavernous and there's room lock for the Low cover to be stored under there now if you need more space and you're not carrying seven people you can fall down this rear most row so here we go they do this thing this is why this is useful look I can sit here while I wait for that to happen now there is 750 liters of space it's huge if you want even bigger fold the lock down come on it's absolutely massive turn this thing into a van now you might be thinking about all this electrical seat operation is a bit too fancy and it adds to the cost and if you're after a seven-seater that's very big and a lot less expensive than this X7 I found one through car wire and there's a good offer on it if you want to see what that car is and the deal click on the pop-out band up there for the link in the description below now present to five or nine things about the BMW X7 BMW's extendable seat bases are really good for giving some extra under thigh support however the design of them means that often crumbs can get trapped in there okay he's been eating Pringles in his car you know the rules for such an expensive car you'd think that it would have a special washer system for its rear view camera because in weather like this it gets absolutely covered in Grime I mean look at that means you have to get out and clean it with your finger so you can get a view of what's behind you it's better another thing you'd expect in a car of this price is some form of soft lining in the door pocket so that things don't rattle about in there when you're driving along literally everything is controlled through this screen so if you want to do the climate you have to press that and then you can control things like the fan speed bit of a fast even worse though is before when you want to use the adaptive cruise controller an ultimate amount of distance the car keeps you from the car in front used to be able to do it by pressing a button on the steering wheel nice and easy now though you have to go into a driving mode so select this feature go to driver settings go into driver assistance and then go into distance control and then you can change it what off that also this is the sporty version the M16 sometimes you might want to turn off the traction control to do that in the past you used to just press this button here hold it down and it would turn it off but now it brings up this menu and then you have to press the button you want when you're driving this is stupid this carbon fiber trim looks cool but the high gloss finish is very reflective and you can see flickering as you're driving along past trees and stuff like that then there's this ambient Lighting on the M60 version looks really nice when it's little at night the only problem is you get really bad reflections of it in the windows once again very distracting it's not all negative though here's five good things about this car unlike some other supposedly sporty models from some German manufacturers this BMW will not automatically change upper gear when you reach the red line if you're in manual mode you'll have to do it yourself there's a rev counter I'm in first he'll just sell the limiter unless I go and off we go again thank God for that full control not only is Android auto widescreen on the main part of the internet system it can even display Google Maps on the digital drives display not many cars do that you can load the car down its air suspension to make it easy to load by pressing this button I'll show you it working now so I'll press the button then leave my thumb here at button height and you'll see how much it drops it seems to be going up first and now it's going down it's not the quickest and it does only give you an extra few inches but an extra few inches are always welcome the ambient Lighting in the car actually extends to the sunroof that you can change the color it's really cool look it's yellow let's move through some of them go to green we've got a sort of Bluey color there oh very nice and we can go for a purple burlesque experience and finally I think I might leave it on a orange nice that the m60i version gets them upgrades to its chassis so the center Fit air suspension is retuned for a sportier drive you also get active anti-roll bars and standard rear wheel steering as standard and there's even a limited slip differential on the rear axle plus there's M sport brakes too the engine lineup on the X7 is really simple there's a three liter straight six turbo diesel with 352 horsepower or three liter straight six turbo petrol with 381 horsepower or this wonderful 4.4 liter twin turbo V8 with 530 horsepower it's a proper M engine built by BMW's M Division and it will go in the next M5 probably with more power though now the engines drive all four wheels one eight-speed automatic gearbox so which version of the XM would I choose engine and trim well what I'm going to do is configure my perfect excellent using the car wire configurator and if you want to see what that car is exactly and the deal deal through color click on the pop-out band up there for the link in the description below okay let's see what the X7 is like to drive it's run off within town so you get a great view out nice elevated driving position decent sized back window though those remote seats if you've got the headrests up do block The View somewhat also it's quite a big pillar and the door mirrors for such a big car could do with being a little bit larger I could probably have made it to that Gap easily but playing it safe because it is quite a large car though doesn't feel as large as a Range Rover however with the Range Rover you have the benefit of sitting even higher up so it feels a little bit more Regal than this one thing I think this is really good at though is the combination between the engine and the gearbox when you're just pootling around in town it's so smooth so effortless really easy to drive the suspension also does a great job of dealing with the Buns considering this is the sporty version I'm just going to do U-turn to show you the Turning Circle because this M60 version comes with rear wheel steering as standard and that means that the Turning Circle comes down to 12.4 meters which clearly isn't enough for this particular system situation interestingly if you have a Range Rover with a rear wheel steering it's turning circle is 11 meters which is much better and the Range Rover Would Have Made It round that turn if you want to see my full in-depth video review of the new Range Rover click on the pop out there for the link in the description below right let's go out of town and stretch this car's legs so here's some dual carriageway I'm cruising up 40 I'm going to floor it flooded but everybody lay down the gearbox for now whoa this engine is crazy it was like did you want me to go quickly yes he does and then this thing just buggered off that is intense I'm sure if I was in sports mode the gear change would have been quicker but you don't tend to drive around in sports mode otherwise the car is holding too lower gear all the time I've got to show you now actually sports mode now see I mean a higher gear like I'm going to normal Drive comfort and it'll drop again there we go I'll tell you what I'd speed this thing is really cool and relaxing really really nice suspension just deals with the bumps it like floats but always remains planted there's not much road noise considering the size of those tires all I'm noticing is a little bit of wind flitter from here that's it but generally overall this is a really relaxing car to do some distancing well it's less relaxing is the economy if you have this particular version with the V8 80 miles to the gallon but I didn't help it by flooring it just but either way it's not going to do much better than that it's gonna get expensive go for one of the Diesels instead that'd be better finally then let's try the X7 out on a twisty Road I'm going to go into sports mode which will stiffen up the air suspension go manual for the gearbox as well [Music] right here's a corner let's see what it does it's going to lean over much no it stays completely flat really feeling the benefit of those active anti-roll bars which makes it stay so flat for a tall heavy vehicle it's insane and even though I'm in sports mode this thing is riding over the bumps very very well it's not skipping at all I thought it might do it's still composed the steering's precise there's not much feel through it but you know this is a big SUV but it puts the car exactly where you want it to go and you can hustle this thing along like something crazy obviously the Lesser versions aren't going to be quite as Punchy or handle quite as sharply but all x7s are pretty impressive whatever Road you're driving on and if you need to they can do a bit of off-roading as well not like Range Rover off-roading but off-roading enough for most people look at this is going around here whoa they get on the gas and wow this engine is so good BMW says the X7 M60 can do not 60 in 4.7 seconds but let's find out the reality using my specialist timing gear here I'm going to launch it let's go brake boost launch control active whoa the traction considering the road is where it is insane no to 60. 3.91 seconds be able to do a right bunch of blooming Liars [Music] so then what's my final verdict on the revised BMW X7 should you avoid it should you consider it should you shortlist it or should you just go right ahead and buy it well I reckon you should shortlist the X7 it's a really good luxury seven-seater SUV I hope you'll enjoyed the video if you did give it a like

47;BMW;2023 BMW X7;2023 BMW X7 Review;the X7 is the biggest vehicle BMW makes and for 2023 it's got a host of updates including a new face For Better or Worse what's up folks I'm Dave undercover editor-in-chief of autolist.com a sister company to CarGurus the X7 is BMW's full-size three-row luxury crossover and it's been around since 2019. not content to rest on this Laurels BMW gave it a refresh for 2023 that includes this new face a new powertrain that's more powerful and more efficient and a host of tech upgrades inside but is that enough to beat Rivals from Mercedes-Benz Lexus Lincoln and Cadillac let's go find out but before we do be sure to like And subscribe to this channel so you can get alerts on all of our future updates alright let's take a look at the exterior of this new X7 and as you've probably noticed it's the front where you're going to see the biggest change this is a new design that basically splits up the headlights so you've got your daytime running lights and your blinkers up here and then your headlights down here and this split look is something BMW is using on its higher end model so you're going to see it here and you'll see it on the 7 Series sedan and frankly I'm glad they're kind of limiting it to these vehicles and not trickling it down to the lower RN models because I'm not sure I like it as much as the rest of the BMW lineup be that as it may you actually have some interesting details that BMW worked into this new design you've got a front end vent here that is actually functional the air passes through that and then out over the front tire you've got brush metal accents here and along the Grille you can get this Grille illuminated as an option on this base model higher end models that'll come standard and then down below you have some sensors for the active safety features but what do you guys think do you like this new look or do you prefer the original look on the X7 that's been around since 2019 let us know in the comments below another thing I want to point out is that down below you've got this polished metal accent piece that runs along the length of the X7 that's all well and good except up here along the window and then on the roof rails you've got brush metal so it's a bit of a disconnect but whatever I'm not a designer and then at the back of the X7 really not much has changed it's a very clean look overall I like that if you do look up close these tail lights have a bit of a 3D LED look to them so that's kind of cool and one last thing to note is that while most SUVs the tailgate is one piece this one Still Remains split all right now to powertrains and this is probably my favorite upgrade that BMW made to the X7 for the 2023 model year this is the base model so it's the xDrive 40i which means it has an inline turbocharged six-cylinder engine paired with a 48 volt mild hybrid system it now makes a total of 375 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque that's a bump of 40 horsepower and 52 pound-feet of torque over the earlier X7 so that's really nice even better it's more efficient thanks to that mild hybrid system it now is rated at 22 miles per gallon overall that's up one mile per gallon over the earlier X7 so overall you get 21 miles per gallon in the city 25 on the freeway and 22 overall all x7s are going to be paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and full-time all-wheel drive so what do you guys think is 375 horsepower enough for a vehicle this big let us know in the comments below because if it's not BMW also offers the m60i that's a twin turbocharged 4.4 liter V8 with 523 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque it too has a 48 volt mild hybrid system with auto start stop and M sport exhaust and then on top of that there's the Alpena xb7 version of the X7 that also has a twin turbo 4.4 liter V8 but in that case it makes 631 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque all right now to the interior and this is another area where BMW gave the X7 a pretty thorough makeover the biggest thing you're going to notice is this curved display here this is a 12.3 inch screen for the instrument panel and then a 14.9 inch screen that's a touch screen for the infotainment system and I like the way that it's set up I like the display it's very futuristic and forward-looking that's pretty cool I will say there are some things that I don't like and mainly it's the menus and display for the instrument panel they just get a little wonky a little hard to navigate sometimes so that's been frustrating trading as we've been driving this car but overall this infotainment screen has been pretty good what I like is that it is a touch screen up here and then you have redundant controls physical buttons down below so however you like to use the screen you can do that that's pretty nice it has Wireless Apple carplay and wireless Android auto I'll show you a carplay right here takes up the full screen very responsive screen nice and easy to use very bright and crisp there's also a voice activated personal assistant and on paper it should be pretty easy to use you just hit a button on the steering wheel and issue any number of commands from turning on the heated seats or turning on the heated steering wheel things like that I've been using it for the past week and that's why I said on paper it should be easy to use because the reality is pretty different every time I hit a button and tell it to do something it asks me to repeat myself multiple times I end up just getting pretty frustrated and using just the screen functions or the buttons down below so just something to consider another thing that gets a little frustrating about this screen is the climate functions now as you can see down below you've got the temperature controls for both the driver and the passenger here they're always here displayed no matter what else you have on that screen so that's a nice touch but to get to the actual fan speed or anything else you want to do for the climate you got to hit this climate menu and then this whole screen pops up it's kind of an elaborate complicated screen you've got the heated steering wheel functions there it's just annoying that if I want to hit the fan speed I've got to go through all these menus rather than just having a button very easily accessible down below so that's just frustrating I wish BMW and any other manufacturer that does this just had easily accessible buttons for those features another thing to note is not everything that you see here is standard the X7 that we're testing starts at 78 000 including destination for the six cylinder engine the one we're testing has a total sticker price of about ninety seven thousand dollars so part of what you get for that big up charge is the four thousand dollar executive package included in that are these massaging heated and cooled seats that's a nice touch and also adds glass controls for the shifter here and for the infotainment knob we've seen that in other BMW models that we've tested before you also get goodies like a 464 watt 16 speaker Harman Kardon audio system it's a great sounding system in here you've got heated and cooled cup holders it's a nice little touch and soft closing doors in terms of connectivity you've got a standard USB port right here you've got a Wireless smartphone charging pad in front of the cup holders and then a USBC charge port in the center console here overall there are some things to like about the interior and some things I don't like in general it is a very comfortable very luxurious very high quality feeling place there's nothing that feels cheap or where they cut any Corners so that's nice Definitely what you would expect on a vehicle that's cost ninety seven thousand dollars like this one you've got a stitch dashboard the seats are very comfortable very Supple you also have a really nice suede headliner so all of those things do add up you've got some weird shapes both in the vents here and this sort of translucent panel and then above the vents over on that side and by the drivers just a little weird doesn't quite give you the harmonious look you might expect in a luxury SUV like this one all right now to the second row and as you would expect I mean 100 000 luxury SUV this is a very comfortable place to be I've got the seat set where I would have it I'm six foot one so basically I'm sitting behind myself and as you can see plenty of room for my feet my legs my knees my toes and then Headroom you would expect that again on a vehicle this large nice features to have back here include power seats before and a half they also require line I've got power sun shades and I can control them on either side from both this door or that passenger door as well that's pretty cool down here I've got my own climate control functions including the buttons for the heated seats back here that's nice to have and then you've got a storage space and even further down below you've got a pair of USBC charge ports if that's not enough each of these seats has another USBC charge port built into the back a couple more features that make life enjoyable in these rear seats you've got a standard panoramic moon roof that comes in all X7 models that's nice to have you've got a really nice armrest here with some cup holders a little extra storage space and then down below the center floor right here is almost flat so you can put taller people in this middle seat and it's not the Penalty Box it might be in other models now because this is a luxury three row crossover of course these seats are power operated which actually is really frustrating this is one case where they're just overthinking it right let me show you how slow this is to get to the rear seats I've already hit the button right so now the driver's seat is moving out of the way this is going to slide out of the way imagine you have kids right now they're trying to get in the car everyone's waiting we're still waiting still waiting that's a really slow seat and now you can get in the access is good once it finally gets there but man I really just wish there was pull straps these are pole straps but these are really more for an emergency you've got one here for the back seat passengers and one here for the side but overall again just give me a pull strap where these seats move out of the way very quickly and the kids can get in the back once you finally get back here and the seats slowly adjust back to their original position you do have some good space back here I've got the middle seat adjusted to where I had it again I'm six foot one so I'm sitting behind myself and I could ride back here for a good amount of time I've got plenty of room for my feet and my knees my head does hit a little bit but overall it's not that bad another nice thing is that you've got another glass panel up here really sort of opening up the cabin that's helpful and again I've got my own climate controls even in this third row that's again a really nice feature to have where you're not getting too hot or too cold just based on what the people are doing in front of you another thing that's annoying about these third row seats is that there's no way for me to adjust where this middle row is so if I need more space it's dependent on the person in front of me moving in the seat for me I wish BMW had just built in a button or a lever or any way to adjust where the seat is at the back the X7 offers 12.8 cubic feet of space behind this third row of seats when they are folded all the way up if you do fold those down you have just under 49 cubic feet of space behind the second row of seats now that puts the X7 on the smaller side when it comes to Interior Space of luxury three-row crossovers a couple of other things to note again this is a split tailgate so it opens about two-thirds of the way up and then the bottom third opens down that's kind of nice actually because it gives you a little platform to sit on in case you're tailgating or doing anything like that in the back you do have these power buttons to fold all the seats and what I like is that there's a One Touch button that you can hit and all the seats will fold up or a button you'll hit and all those seats will fold down so you don't have to be hitting multiple buttons at the same time all right driving Impressions now because this is a BMW you probably expect it to handle well and have really good Dynamics and the good news is it does the key thing to note is that this refreshed X7 has a standard air suspension and it's been re-tuned and recalibrated and I really like what BMW has done for that retuning that's because in Comfort mode both in this version and the earlier version it does feel like you lean a little bit too much the vehicle feels a little ponderous but now when you put it into sport mode it definitely sharpens everything up and feels like you would expect a BMW to feel like that's really nice previously when you put the X7 into sport mode you really didn't feel much of a difference so I'm really liking the fact I just hit one button and I've got the BMW that I was expecting what I also like is how Supple this suspension feels now remember we have 23 inch alloy wheels on this vehicle that's a really big wheel a lot of times when you put something that big onto a vehicle you really are affecting the Dynamics it feels sort of rough over potholes or things like that not so here it feels like BMW took that into account when they tuned the suspension so you get the best of both worlds you get these really nice looking Wheels really big but also a really comfortable ride so that's a really nice feature that I'm appreciating and in terms of power that 40 horsepower bump over the earlier version of the X7 is definitely well received here 375 total horsepower feels great this car will do 0-60 in 5.6 seconds now that's not a lightning lap that's not going to blow anyone's doors off but overall this engine and powertrain are certainly enough to handle a vehicle of this size don't think you need to step up to that twin turbo V8 to get the meaningful power although I will say that is an excellent engine so it won't begrudge you if you do spend the extra coin there in terms of visibility it's good in this X7 but not great these a-pillars right here in front of me are kind of thick and then the B pillar the ones over my shoulder feel really thick so when you're backing out of maybe a driveway or when you're looking over your shoulder to change lanes on the freeway you definitely feel like you've got to look extra hard that gets a little frustrating and then out the back the rear window is actually perfectly fine in terms of size but it's the rear seats themselves that sit up kind of high and eat into your visibility area so that gets a little annoying when it comes to competition the X7 is up against some industry heavyweights those include the Mercedes-Benz GLS the Cadillac Escalade the Lincoln Navigator the Jeep Grand Wagoneer and maybe even the Lexus LX of all those competitors the Mercedes-Benz GLS is probably the closest to this X7 they're both unibody platforms they're both German they have really great driving Dynamics they're similar sizes if I had to choose the more luxurious version I'd go with a GLS whereas this BMW is a little more Tech focused and has a little better driving Dynamics the Cadillac Escalade and the Lincoln navig Navigator those are built on truck platforms so they're not going to be as refined as this X7 but they're also going to have more interior space and they're also going to offer bigger engines in terms of safety all x7s come standard with forward Collision warnings automatic emergency braking blind spot monitoring with rear cross traffic alerts and Lane departure warnings alright folks there you have it our review of the 2023 BMW X7 Pros well we love the new powertrain it's more efficient and more powerful than before and it's great to drive on the road we also really like the quiet and luxury feel of This SUV cons will the front end look may not be for everybody and we're not sure we like it more than the earlier X7 plus the seating configurations inside can be frustrating and slow to use and finally the interior space is down versus some of its Rivals so for reviews or listings of this X7 or anything else you're shopping for new or used be sure to check out cargurus.com and if you have a car to sell

48;BMW;2023 BMW X7;2023 BMW X7 | The Best Gets Even Better;I fell hard for the X7 when I first tested it four years ago and then dialed it up to 11 last year when I spent a week with the Alpena xb7 and now for its first refresh BMW is making the best even better there is no shortage of Ultra Premium SUVs over which to drool such as the Urus cullinan or bentega but for less than one hundred thousand dollars the BMW X7 isn't playing second fiddle to any of them refreshed in all the right ways for the 2023 model year the X7 is BMW had its Sav best in a true standout in the luxury three-row class when I first drove the X7 upon its debut in 2019 it was evident that BMW's long-awaited three-row SUV was going to be a huge success case in point it outsold all of its Rivals last year including the Mercedes-Benz GLS and Audi Q7 and this substantial refresh will only increase the x7's desirability introducing BMW's new design language for luxury models the heavily revised front end instantly changes the X7 stance to that of a more athletic machine with the split headlights an illuminated Grille adding true distinction in M Sport Design and painted Brooklyn gray with optional 22-inch wheels and extended Shadow line trim this is one gorgeous SUV with presents for days looking anything but base this is the xDrive 40i the entry level X7 priced from 78 845 it's offered in luxury and M sport designs to suit specific tastes an arrow kit sport seats special exhaust system and operated brakes are just a smattering of the M sport goodies while this X7 also benefits from nearly every package and option presenting itself as top of the line but without the executive package which includes glass controls and massaging seats or a V8 this X7 is the first rung on the build sheet ladder msrps tested is 93 745 making this a ride for the one percent but when compared to the astronomical prices commanded by some of the aforementioned Elite SUVs the X7 is a bargain proposition for those whose egos need an exotic badge Beyond its modernized appearance this X7 is more powerful and fitted with BMW's updated iDrive 8 infotainment system and curved display utilizing the latest 48 volt mild hybrid technology the new turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine boasts 40 more horsepower and considerably more torque than its predecessor while also improving fuel economy rated at 375 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque with a quick boost to 398 pound-feet under maximum acceleration the X7 is a little quicker than before 0-60 arrives two tenths faster at 5.6 seconds gas mileage is also up a tick to 21 MPG City 25 Highway stepping up to the v8-powered m60i will lock more than a full second off of that time but this re-engineered six is spectacularly smooth and torquey rendering more cylinders completely Overkill what can I say this is as good as it gets in the three-row arena it is spectacular from this Exquisite ride quality to the hermetically sealed cabin it's everything I would want in a gas powered SUV it also drives like a BMW with All the Right Moves this updated cabin is fresh and techy and when heavily optioned like this one it Pampers the driver and occupants as if it was your own personal concierge as for the negatives I don't really have much for you other than to say that at nearly ninety four thousand dollars it should be this good the M sport exhaust system doesn't contribute much auditory enhancement but paired with the new 8-speed trans Mission with launch control this 40i is as slick and as quick as most every driver could want grab the left paddle shifter and hold it to initiate Sprint all powertrain and Chassis systems go directly to their sportiest settings and the electric boost is activated it's all very composed yet exciting but my favorite X7 attributes are its remarkable ride quality and super hushed cabin the miles simply melt away in here as the X7 makes quick and seamless work of any road imperfections virtually eliminates body roll and fosters a sense of Peace the air suspension retune chassis systems and active roll stabilization in addition to rear wheel steering make for an exceptional passenger experience the range between comfort and Sport settings has been further extended with this update press the drive mode button whether it's Eco Pro Comfort or Sport and changes start happening the ambient lighting most pronounced on the X7 graphic in front of the passenger seat moves from Blue to red or any other color you'd like the body raises or lowers accordingly the seats tighten or relax and the chassis morphs into whatever it is you desire typically this X7 would be wearing summer use tires but because of the season this one is fitted with Pirelli scorpion winter run Flats which work wonderfully I highly recommend them but the price is exorbitant over eight hundred dollars per for the massively wide rear tires one of the x7's Hallmark features is its seating controls and I don't just mean for Comfort but I'm also talking about the various ways you can create passenger and cargo space every row of seats in here is power operated six ways to Sunday and then here in the second row you get these nice little pillows on the headrests there's a USB type-c port tucked away right there two more down below here on the center console you've got another two zones of climate control and then heated seats with three settings and then over here on the door there are controls not only for the sun shades on both windows but also for the sun shades overhead here and back there so at ninety four thousand dollars you mustn't do anything for yourself the neatest trick is the ability to convert from Max people space to Max hauling by pressing a single switch in the cargo area the power split fold tailgate also includes a button to lower the body for easier loading entering the nicely sized third row seats is accomplished at the touch of a button which kicks off a Rube goldberg-like set of seat movements as the front seats slide forward and the second row seats articulate up and away it's certainly a labor-free experience but everything about these seat machinations takes a little too long to complete also note that second row Captain's chairs are optionally available but this tester goes three across to make it a true seven seater the smallest Center screen of the previous year's model was the only Telltale sign of Aging so BMW has gone full 12.3 inch curved display melding into a 14.9 inch central control display it's a touch screen with tablet like tiles that can also be controlled via the typical iDrive rotary controller or through voice with a wake-up word such as hey BMW it even responds to hand gestures as part of the premium package it's very modern with an augmented navigation system that uses the front camera and directional Arrow overlays to bring reality to driving directions the head up display is also packed with bits of information that transcends speed the surround View Camera gets its own real button however I wish the climate controlled seats and heated steering wheel activations were also off the screen because it takes a second or two to boot up what's missing there's no rear view camera mirror and there's no hands-free highway driving the soft closed doors the extended welcome lighting mat the heated armrests this new X7 had me at hello there's also a judicious use of environmentally friendly materials employed such as the new leather-like sense of fin seating surfaces assembled in South Carolina and also available as the v8-powered m60i and soon as the range-topping Alpena xb7 the X7 xDrive 40i is a dream machine made even better for testdrivenow.com I'm Steve Hamas
49;BMW;2023 BMW X7;2023 BMW X7 M60i Review // Don't Buy That Range Rover Just Yet;it's time for your time hey ready to go yeah I'll just go finish this ad side effects will absolutely include headaches nausea dizziness an ad for what what do you mean well you know how like a while back they introduce the subscription services for stuff yeah yeah I stopped paying for my start stop button so instead I just have to watch an ad and then we can put them in anus socially inappropriate libido and in not so rare cases clinical death speak to your doctor to see if presnostazella millicillin okay for you there we go okay time for an upgrade introducing the iPhone Air there's another ad playing what's this one for we got rid of it I thought it might be nice if we have heated seats for this journey using Apple's latest Cloud technology we were able to turn Hardware into air air [Music] you're watching throttle house I'm Thomas I'm James and this is the BMW X7 m60i life cycle in-balls foreign so not only does this X7 benefit from the 2023 life cycle impulse BMW's fancy word for facelift but it also becomes the beneficiary of a brand new engine so new looks new engine new features this is no gentle update and it shouldn't be because the X7 m60i starts at 129 000 Canadian and this one is spec to 147 000 let's have at it and if you [Applause] we do car reviews track tests and quite a lot of messing about so subscribe hit the Bell [Music] mind control oh it's quite a significant that is quite significant much control 0-60 in 4.68 seconds and that is with both of us in the car yep that's pretty good that's very good it's pretty good and I can tell you how we've achieved that Thomas okay you're probably wondering what that 60 eyes on the back means I am because it was the V12 in the seven six m760i 60 I always meant V12 no longer a V12 okay it's a V8 it is a V8 but now this gets the new proper n engine the s68 which is what you're going to see on all the new M cars right so you know it's basically an all-new engine it's got new crankshaft new turbocharger technology new oil sump all of that comes together to make the 60i a very different story to the 50i okay in the 50i in the m50i you've got 523 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque right in this you get 523 horsepower and 553 pound of torque as well yeah right all the new stuff and they've tuned it to make the exact same power as before which is not true for the 40i the 40i gets a 40 horsepower okay and it's not true if the incoming Alpena which is getting a horsepower bump 18 horsepower bump to 630 so just to recap that entire explanation that you just gave us and me and the audience yes was pointless no because the main reason they did it is because I don't think they were meeting the efficiency standards engines okay so the 60i straight up replaces the 50i well it's not any quicker it has no more power but it's capable of more power and more importantly your friend the sucker who's just bought a Range Rover a brand new Range Rover doesn't have this engine get to the m50i engine the old engine so really you're winning well it is a nice engine it sounds pretty cool I'm in Sport Plus right now and you know what I didn't know that I had to look it up because it doesn't feel any different things that don't feel that different because first of all it's already quite an impressive vehicle the X7 we've always liked it in Sport Plus mode it gives you like well this also has the M Sport Pro so it's got the more aggressive exhaust right and also in a pretty cool feature as well we're talking about drivetrain really quickly put this in Comfort mode we cruise around I have a big issue with Comfort mode I'll tell you about that in a second but if I hold this left paddle it puts me in Sprint mode and stiffens everything up for a second and makes the transmission snappier and thanks to the 48 volt mod hybrid yeah which this now gets still the same horsepower but it now gets a 48 volt lot hybrid so not only does it make start stop smoother it actually just throws a bit more torque also new for the LCI X7 is the addition of active anti-roll bars engineered to attain maximum softness when desired but able to firm up when required I only really had one issue with it it doesn't work well before you say that you uh yeah I mean so the idea behind it and they say it's to reduce the amount of head that you get the amount you get tossed no no head toss wow those words really have to yeah you have to get the correct order is vital is to reduce the amount of head tossed you get tossed head no no no no no no no no no no no it's the amount of head toss you get while you're moving it in premature we've experienced n60i for mature above 60. so so basically what it does is it in Comfort mode in a straight line it keeps everything really soft so you it should control side to side motions but allow the ride to be nice the problem is I don't don't say that to me when I'm in the code the Comfort mode what we're in right now are you getting some head toss yeah yeah it's not good and it's not a good kind no um I I find so the goal there was to be able to go softer without losing without right now you feel that yeah once you load it up into a corner it tightens them up and we're fine but in the entry in the exit of the corner I'm getting thrown all over the place compared to an Escalade V we just were in the Escalade V and you said that was a master class in chassis engineering it is because that that car it just somehow controls motions in exactly the right way yeah I will say though that in Sport Plus mode right now of all the big SUVs this one's driving close to the best it it drives smaller than it is like you have to remind yourself you're in an X7 yeah you're not back there's another road there's another row yeah it's like the steering is good weights up naturally all the calibration of the throttle and the brakes of sport mode is good and there's not too many unnecessary motions in Sport Plus guns but you're just leaving it in Sport Plus mode wake up in the morning Sport Plus mode have a coffee Sport Plus mode Drive the kids to work kids don't go to work you go to work you use Sport Plus mode but what about fuel economy what about you just bought a twin turbo V8 SUV how much can you truly care about silicon technically you've foregone the Escalade V you've made a sensible decision of okay yeah I guess the other option is a Supercharged V8 fair enough but you know considering this is 7 series there isn't much going on back here for me to like play with well you'll notice this little thing here yeah there you go oh yes right you can put a thing in there that holds on to your own eyes I do have a pillow though what a pillow Oh I thought we were in place of an iPad that was confusing no I can't see it yeah yeah that's my comfort that's my fun thing the whole car is very sharp in Sport Plus mode which is where you should own the only place I don't think I shoot for the Alpena you know I think this is all you need this is probably all you need you don't need 630 horsepower I would even find a way to be happy with the 40i 40i yeah save some money all right well you know what a big part of this facelift is the way it looks so let's let's have a little chat [Music] thank you for bringing your weather with us by the way from England I tried to dress Canadian yeah you did and it didn't you succeeded yeah you'd fool someone I'd fooled everyone yeah I Pied Piper if rained us yeah until they see you try and play hockey I can't even skate on the ice that is okay yeah yeah all right this is an X7 yes um obviously by the massive Grill however the grill Is Now dwarfed by The IX yeah well it's different that's a different shape a different shape but also but like this is like just huge it's funny actually years ago only a couple years ago when they first started the new design language yeah I remember when the X5 came out and the X7 came out I'm asking you on the phone I'm like I can't tell the difference between the X5 and the X7 no and and you came up with a method so you'll you'll know when you see an X7 because you'll see it and you'll be offended yes that's the difference the exercise like oh that's big but have you or have you not got used to it in these couple of years does this now not look complete I have got used to it I haven't got used but I still regret there was a there was a sketch that we wrote that ended up on The Cutting Room floor and I wonder if you remember this where we were going to accidentally crash the X7 and the grill was going to be broken and I'd have to go get a replacement part and I came back with a fence panel I'm so glad we didn't do that that's one of the ones we didn't do a lot of those the big difference now so this hasn't actually changed in size to my knowledge I don't think so but we now have for the first time ever on a BMW yeah split headlights wow yeah so they made the headlights smaller so that the girl would look bigger it's just this is the new look now the seven series is going to have this as well and it comes with the free condensation on the inside no that's that's part of the spread effect for a warmer a war like a diffuser correct it's a diffuser right yeah okay um but they're not the only people doing split headlights at the moment are they no I thought that was something we were in recently what was that anyway I think it looks good you know it honestly is a good looking vehicle I have as you say got used to the grill it's it's great I would be so mad if in like 15 years we look back on the current BMW design and we're like wow you know what it was age great and we and they nailed it I I refuse to believe that's the truth I don't have a problem with it and they've added some stuff so the tail lights so first of all and Wing mirrors and Wing mirrors yes and Barge on the front see my M2 does not have M Wing mirrors right and I was upset about that but every new non-full M that comes out that has these I get happier and happier that mine doesn't have them oh I see because it's diluted yes so we've got this 3D patterning going on here yeah well that's when it's lit it looks very cool I really like that not changed that much at the back though I'm surprised they didn't go with the with the with the Halo sword tail lights look on the Xbox three yeah I'm surprised and then for the first time ever for a BMW yeah these are 22 inch but you can get 23 inch wheels wow which the GLS already has this is these are the 22s this is definitely the move because the ride's just gonna be better well they say that the 23 inches improve efficiency oh maybe less rolling resistance or something but like I'll take a soft ride any day yeah right over over a liter per 100 kilometer but yeah so that's good before we get the uh Alpena this is as aggressive as an X7 is going to look right um but they've got some cool stuff going on inside as well because that's part of the update the LCI let's take a look [Music] yeah it's soft close it is yeah it is this thing this is a seven series as an SUV lifted and a part of that because now because with the XM has always felt like a big X5 yes and nothing more whereas it's supposed to be a seven so now we get I drive eight so I actually like iDrive 8 better but I don't like the fact that it always seems to be in a screen box TV glued to the dashboard like they've really gone all day so I described that badly terribly it's a TV glued to the dashboard it's a square how else can you do a screen integrated into the thing and like before they like they had like the cool swoop on the corner right it was I missed my swoop all right yeah I think it works really well and because this is the new one look at that the ambient bar wow yeah so this so this is more ambient lighting first of all so it matches the color of the ambient light even though it's great you can actually see it coming through the speaker even right now in the daytime but it also changes this if you get a phone call it does different things take a flash with a phone call it's like it's just like an effect bar kind of like the S-Class did with it's like oh yeah but yeah that was cool no no this is a really nice interior what we've just in there was like similar oh uh the escalated V Escalade V right we've just been a few competitors actually there in the Range Rover the Range Rover yeah the Range Rover is similar price to this a little bit more the one we've had aspect the Range Rover then on the inside was way more yeah this is much more German but it's also very busy very athletic and sporty right like it's the carbon fiber well they of course it down it's got this smooth single line air compound here these little crocodile heads these are cool you can spin them to lock it I don't know they're kind of weird they're kind of fun to play with yeah they're fun um speaking of things to play with there's a a knob that's got a bit smaller um that we've lost the shifter okay yeah a little piece of glass I was trying to figure out where you were going yeah yeah the little glass shifting yeah little nubbing like uh like the Porsche these words that you're choosing it sounds right I believe that a nubbin is is that a third nipple it might be a third nipple oh there's a Chandler Friends Chandler yeah yeah that's right so yeah that's a bit of a strange move I I really did like the shifter before that so I don't know why they did that but I guess it's just space yeah it's nice it's a little kind of it's a bit flashy with the Crystal but I guess it'll probably work fine and this is a well optioned one so we've got the uh the cooled and heated cup holders those are really cool yeah but nothing nothing has massively changed no like the cabin backwards is identical so yeah still comfortable for an adult in the middle still comfortable once we've finally moved all the chairs around which take ages by the way yeah um Harrison and I tested the back seats with some difficulty yeah but we managed to uh managed to fit back there he doesn't fit but myself at five foot ten I fit he's also a nice little like wind light was it a light sunroof sunroof there it is a Solarium back there yeah no it's coffee and then this uh is actually optioned with the tartufo leather which holds a special place in our hearts um because Thomas and I went for a very nice dinner on his honeymoon uh at a place called tafu that's true it's true it's a weird sentence isn't it I went for a lovely dinner with Thomas on his honeymoon this is one of that story actually this was uh his name this is a trip in Italy when James decided he didn't like truffles at all and he wanted to take me to this one restaurant which he'd been to before and it was called tartufo and he's like what's this tattoo for mean turns out it's truffle but at the end of that trip at least Electronics it doesn't smell truffles in here no and it's very nice nice just to be clear my wife was on that in that restaurant was well it wasn't just me and James told me what you want okay anyway this is nice I like it it's it's a it's a bit like flashy and busy but it's well designed it's intuitive it's comfortable I I don't really have any issues with this and I must say that I do like this version of iDrive better than the one that we only had for a year or two which was what I drive seven seven maybe listen as far as life cycle impulses go I think this is a pretty solid one it is so there we have it the X and has been pulsed the split headlights might have some people split but really all the changes seem to be for the better compared to the Range Rover it's not quite as plush inside but it's cheaper it's new looks distinguish it even further from the likes of its GLS rival and it drives a lot smaller than the big Americans if you were already an X7 fan the X7 just got better thanks for watching and a special thank you to the jasons which admittedly sounds like a new sitcom but actually refers to the two highly talented Automotive creators you saw at the

50;BMW;2023 BMW X7;BMW X7 v Range Rover: ULTIMATE luxury test!;BMW X7 or extended wheelbase Range Rover which is the best seven-seater SUV we're gonna find out Buy sell car wow let's start this video by talking about the prices of these two luxury SUVs so the X7 range starts from 85 000 pounds whereas the Range Rover extended wheelbase starts from 107 000 pounds however the cars I have here aren't the entry level models so that is the X7 M60 that starts from 116 000 pounds and this particular Range Rover in this spec 127 000 pounds less price what really matters though is the price you pay a dealer for instance through car while you can save an average of just over 5000 pounds off the X7 range now if you want to go to car one now to check out the latest offers click on the pop-out banner up there for the link in the description below and while I'm at it huge thank you to Romans International who've led us this lovely Range Rover to review go check them out Link in the description considering this Range Rover is one big slab of a car I mean look at it it's one two three four five big matte steps long it's still somehow looks quite spelled maybe that's to do with that sloping roof line you know I do think that land Rover's designers have done a fantastic job with this car I love how they've made it so smooth almost like a pebble that's been rounded after being washed over millions of years by the ocean this car is so aristocratic so Regal looking I love it just don't get too close to it because then you might notice that some of the panels don't line up perfectly sorry to point that out my fellow midlanders in the solid Hall Factory put this card together I wonder if the Germans have a superior attention to detail yeah let's find out shall we so this increase on the body side of the X7 it designed at 100 perfectly but it's pretty blooming close and it is better than on the Range Rover speaking of better this new face BMW of given the X7 is better than the pre-facelift version I like these split headlamps however in some ways it's a little bit too aggressive for the rest of the car so the front is pretty much sports car then you look down the side and go oh yeah it's a big family-friendly SUV overall though I think this design is all right it wouldn't put me off buying the car there really that isn't what car design should be about you know it should actively make you want the car like it does with the Range Rover look at it I just want it and I'm probably willing to forgive some other things about it because it looks so good unless I had to do that with the X7 which means the interior better be bloody good thankfully it is it looks really nice and quality is impeccable Everything You Touch feels expensive BMW Los Interiors are among the very very best they've actually updated the interior of this car so it's now got this new screen like you get on the I4 and The IX big long curved screen really nice high definition it's fairly easy to use for all the different controls touchscreen swivel wheels gestures voice commands though most people are just going to run Apple carplay and Android auto one of the great things about this system is that BMW figured out how to mirror them map from Google on the digital driver's display most manufacturers can't do that for some reason I like that what I like less though is the fact that they've moved the climate controls into the touch screen so you have to do it through here rather than just turning some knobs I'm also not so sure about these knobs they're the only cheap bits of trim in this car like this Edition though like for this M60 version your M light there and when you change the driving mode look at this oh yeah it changes color tiny things please tiny mines can the right driver's interior compete with this in some ways yes and in some ways no you see the interior design on the Range Rover is more simplistic than the BMW I like that I also like the fact that they haven't put the climate controls through the touchscreen so when you want to switch between the temperature control the fan speed and the heated seat you have to port and push at this dial here the screen itself is nice and big and it's curved like in the BMW though in a different way to curve that way rather than that way once again really high definition screen I think it's a little bit more laggy than the BMW system but it's not overly noticeable and when you press press and hit buttons look you get this click clickery it's a bit of a shame that you don't get Apple carplay or Android auto Maps mirrored in the digital driver's display but the display itself is bright and easy to read than in the BMW though to switch to the different menus and settings it's a little bit more of a faff well I can't complain about though is the fact that you get Metal Gear select pedals in the Range Rover rather than the plastic ones you get in the BMW they just feel nicer to touch however there are some bits that are a little bit questionable for core of this price for instance the plastic used up here is of similar quality that's your microwave meal comes in now you might be thinking Matt well he's going to scratch that plastic up there no one does that but that's just for me illustrating how cheap it is you can see just by looking at it that it is cheaper plastic another thing I can see is that whoever fitted this Hazard warning light button didn't manage to get it on quite straight look it's a bit wonky so these buttons here which open and close the glove boxes they're wonky as well the wonkiest bit of all though is a stitching along this Dash it's completely on the piss what's all that about Land Rover actually made a big thing about the range over going even further up marketing not only competing with the likes of the BMW X7 but also Bentleys well I'll tell you one thing Land Rover you ain't gonna compete with Bentley you're stitching like that to be fair though when you get into the back seats of the Range Rover you do know some things which are actually quite badly like for instance this particular Range Rover has a leather roof lining it's gorgeous that is this is the intricate mechanism of the grab handles you don't get this kind of thing on just normal run-of-the-mill cars even the pockets on the seat backs just feel expensive and the mats they have a thick pile then there's a space itself back I mean look at it I've got so much room loading room loads of Headroom to be fair this seat is as far back as it will go but oh if you need to go three people from the back of once as well it's no problem at all this car is so wide and so much space that there's easily enough room for three people to sit in Comfort surely the BMW can't be as accommodating as this huge Range Rover well didn't know what with these seats as far back as they can go it does feel almost as big as the Range Rover look tons of neat room headroom's really good as well the only thing is it doesn't feel quite as wide maybe that's because the sizing to just curve in a bit more because it's less boxy shaped than the rain drove up and you notice that when you have three in the back at once there's not quite as much shoulder room between three adults there are a couple of other things that aren't quite as nice as in the Range Rover for instance these Pockets just don't feel quite substantial the pile of the floor mats is a lot thinner well we do have a nice suede like roof lighting doesn't seem as luxurious as leather and yeah that's just everyday cast of this grab handle nothing special there however one of the big selling points of these cars is the fact that they are seven seaters so now it's time to check out the rimos row you might be wondering welcome to the driver's seat to show you the rear Mouse Row in the X7 well because I first want to show you this feature you can actually give people access to the back by pressing this button here from the driver's seat so press it and the seats start to move there we go moving out the way obviously you can control the seats from buttons here and on the seat as well so once you like getting to the very back well the gap's large enough yeah so yeah you can climb in okay now I'm just gonna pull the seat back by pressing the button just up there see how much room we have okay oh it's coming back a bit more so that's it quite far back not quite as far back as it'll go and your room's okay but I can actually slide this seat further forward and there'll still be enough room for someone to sit comfortably in this seat so new room's good Headroom no two fingers that's okay that's okay I reckon people who are a little bit taller than me will be fine in the back the seats are quite raised up from the floor so you don't feel like you're squatting or in a stress position and there's cutouts underneath the seat speed to put your feet underneath it's not so good if you're this side because obviously the way this splits 40 60 means there's less foot room here than under that seat one thing I do like about this particular car though is not an idea to have sunroof which goes to the front and the middle row you also have your own separate sunroof here in the third row not sure if you get that in the Range Rover let's find out uh no it doesn't seem to that's a shame makes it look a little bit darker back there anyway let's try and get into the back so press this button to move the seat forward can't do it in the driver's seat unfortunately but there does seem to be more room than in the BMW to get in I'm gonna have to move this seat so you can see exactly what's going on back here let's go there it is while that's happening let's bring this one back come on come back because you're told now you can see from this angle that your knee room is okay and I'm going to need that because actually Headroom is pretty tight especially if you sit back my head is hitting against this Ridge here I'm 179 centimeters tall kids will be fine but anyone toilet me is going to struggle a little bit still there is enough need room for me to be able to slouch a bit and because there's a decent cut underneath the seat in front I can fit my feet into there there's more foot space actually than in the BMW another thing that I think is better in this in the BMW is these rear seats raise even more off the ground than the BMW so you've got more under thigh support so overall it is just a little bit more comfortable here in the very back compared to the BMW especially as you can get heated seats in the very back row here in the Range Rover once again I'm going to come back to it I am missing that sunroof it all feels a bit more claustrophobic despite the fact there are some decent sized back windows anyway enough about carrying people what are these cars like for carrying their stuff both of these cars have electrically operated tailgates with a handy split fold function and you can lower them on their air suspension as well to make it easier to load them just just let our little farty sound hopefully there's no follow through now with seven seats in place this has a slightly larger load capacity 330 liters compared to 210 for that's about 50 larger however when you fold down that third row in both the vehicles you find out that the Range Rover has the largest capacity 860 liters compared to 750 for the BMW though if you need in more space you can then fold all the seats down and basically turn these vehicles to Posh luxurious Vans oh my God that's huge no it's not completely flat and neither is that quiet they're both very similar though I think overall that has more space because just look how tall it is inside anyway once you're done you can shut them up like this and it does both the top and bottom part of the tailgate and at that point you notice that the tail lights on the Range Rover are definitely cooler than on the BMW because when the lights aren't on you don't see the tail lights at all they're like blend into the body see one of the things about this car is that you just seem to sit higher and have a better view out than other SUVs now illustrate the difference to the X7 Now using my assistant so I've got the cars air suspension in its mid setting so can you measure how high my eyes are off the ground see how raised up I am what you got 158 centimeters right so 158 centimeters in the Range Rover what's it in the BMW I can tell you right away that I feel like I'm lower down in the X7 but let's find out the exact number come on then measure me again we've got the car wow tape measure of Truth so what is it saying 149. oh 149 that's nine centimeters lower there is one last thing to compare though and that's the engines so both of these cars are available with petrol or diesel power this is the diesel version of the long wheelbase Range Rover it's a three liter straight six Diesel with 350 horsepower you can also get a 3 liter a straight six turbo petrol with 400 horsepower or a 4.4 liter twin turbo V8 with 530 horsepower which interestingly is an engine from BMW though it's not this 4.4 liter twin turbo V8 in the M60 because that's actually built by BMW's M Division and they won't give their M engines to Land Rover other choices are a three liter straight six turbo petrol with 381 horsepower or a three liter straight six Diesel with 352 horsepower both these cars have eight-speed automatic gearboxes an all-wheel drive so now shall we see how they compare out on the road right now let's see how quick these cars are from door to 60 miles an hour by launching them and how close they get to their manufacturer's claim time first up the BMW supposed to do note 60 in 4.7 seconds let's go wow that shot off it's going to be quicker 4.0 seconds that is n't the BMW said would it be a similar story with the Range Rover Land Rover says 0 to 60 takes 6.4 seconds but what does asbestos timing gear say let's find out rate boost release here we go come on what's the number 6.2 seconds not bad for a diesel okay so we still want the acceleration from a stencil is like in this Range Rover but what's it like when you're driving along at 40 then you meet your dual carriage or a Motorway you need to get up to 70 miles an hour let's see how it responds and the gearbox so I'm going to floor it here we go a bit of a pause there between me flooring it and actually doing something but now once it's in its stride this diesel has some serious pulling power and when you're cruising along at speeds it's a very relaxing car to travel in hardly any road noise from those big wheels is surprising little bit of wind flutter just here and there but overall very very relaxing I'm also a little bit more relaxed than you might imagine because I've got the massage seat on now and I'm being gently kneaded yeah nice car to cruise around in this the economy is all right as well it's not too bad for a big thing now we all expect a Range Rover to do well when you're cruising on the motorway but what about a twisty Road you know this is a big tall heavy vehicle let's find out there we go right that's surprising it feels like it's going to topple over but it somehow just grips into the road and goes round now part of the reason for that is that it comes as standard with active anti-roll bars and it stops it leaning so much in the bends it's quite surprising actually what it can do however it's no sports car it's no sports utility vehicle even it still has a very much like leisurely approach to going down a country road part of the reason for that is the steering it's very very light you're not entirely sure what the front wheels are doing no also it's quite big so when you go past a coach like that it can be a bit scary can't fault the brakes though nice and strong nice and Progressive as well not grubby at all and actually you can keep up with most cars you can in this thing and then of course the other area where it matters in town and that's when you really appreciate that race driving position where you can just look down oh here's another big gate oh my God I said you can look down under the vehicles unless they're a bus or a coach can't look down on them but everyone else pretty much or maybe a van van drivers also sit higher in fact don't bother getting a Range Rover just get a van vans also have the same thing as this look this this kind of armrest which is really nice what Vans don't tend to have though feature that's so important on this especially when you're just pottering around town is rear wheel steering as standard so despite being bloody long this car is a turning circle of 11.5 meters which is insanely good just watch this I can turn around in here without curbing those massive alloy wheels and look I can use this bird's eye view to make sure that I don't it's so maneuverable actually more maneuverable than that Honda Civic in front this car is going to take some beating is the BMW X7 up to the task Ryan X7 let's see what you got sign off with pickup from 40 miles an hour when you come to a dual carriageway or motorized I'm going to floor it once again the pause is the gearbox decides what to do but now I've only been in the power there's four point four liter twin turbo V8 it absolutely took off and sounded pretty awesome as well though I think some of that noise is played to the speaker speak of which I think this car is slightly quieter than the Range Rover ever so slightly I'm not getting any tire noise at all once again amazing considering the size of the wheels but there seems to be a little less flutter of wind I bet the economy is not as good as the road driver though now it's 18 miles to the gallon that's the price you pay for that twin turbo V8 I'm sure this car can pull things back on twisty road so let's try it put in sport like with the Range Rover we've got active anti-roll bars to stop it leaning but they're an optional on most X7 so you do get them as standard on this M60 version this car feels way more sporty than the Range Rover it's really quite incredible how it manages to be pretty much as comfortable as you're just floating over bumps in some ways it's actually better at dealing with bumps in the Range Rover yet at the same time it's more tied down it doesn't feel quite so wallowy it's more precise and the steering is definitely just feels more connected to the road than the Range Rover gives you more confidence to go quickly doesn't feel quite as wide either I'm not so nervous of getting closer to the vehicles I don't know why that is one thing I am missing though is that race driving position I mean obviously it's raised up in this but you do notice the difference with the Range Rover you just feel a little bit more Superior I'm also missing the armrest and special armrest on the seat damn it there's another thing I miss with this car and that's the Turning circle of the Range Rover this still has rear wheel steering once again it's an optional most acceptance but the M60 gets it as standard however despite having rear wheel steering the Turning circle is still almost a meter more than the long wheelbase Range Rover so I have to be more careful here come on maybe we can still make it yeah it still made it it's 12.4 meters still I do like this car overall it's just a great balance of comfort and handling it's amazing what BMW have achieved with it sort of does it all [Music] so then what's my final verdict well these cars are both very closely matched and really this Range Rover there's something special about it makes you just want it however I've got to be objective and really in many ways the BMW is actually the better car it's Superior dynamically on-road because that top really matters most people won't ever take these cars off-roading also it's got better build quality and it's better value for money as well and that's why overall it wins this test anyway I hope you'll enjoyed the video if you did give it a like let me know if you're good with my but it's in the comments below click on those windows there for some more videos

51;BMW;2022 BMW X7;2022 BMW X7 Xdrive40i: Start Up, Exhaust, Test Drive, POV and Review;hey everyone and welcome back to the channel so today i'm down at hendrick bmw northlake we're going to take a look at one of their 2022 bmw x7 xdrive40is so huge shout out to them for providing this massive suv for me today make sure you guys check out their website all that info is down in the description the x7 that you see behind me is finished off in mineral white metallic with an msrp just under 90 000. and to start off today's review we're going to take a look at what powers this x7 underneath the hood is the three liter inline six cylinder twin power turbocharged engine paired to the eight-speed steptronic automatic transmission and it pumps out 335 horsepower around 5500 rpm and 330 pound-feet of torque as low as 1500 rpm that power sent through the x-drive all-wheel drive system this weighs in right around 5 300 pounds it'll do zero to 60 in five and a half seconds up to its top speed of 155 miles an hour and it has a fuel capacity of 21.9 gallons you'll expect the fuel economy to be 19 miles per gallon in the city and 24 out on the highway this has a wheelbase of 122.2 inches its overall length is 203.3 it has a width of 78.7 a height of 71.1 and its ground clearance measures in at 8.7 inches and now as we move on to the exterior styling this one is pretty much fully loaded so it has a lot of awesome exterior goodies we're going to start off with the massive kidney design for the grill finished off in chrome on this model all the vertical slats are finished off in more of a brushed trim to give it a two-tone design this even has active grille shutters just behind those to help improve with better aerodynamics there's a nicely incorporated forward-facing camera at the bottom as well as all the parking sensors that run throughout this bumper as well and then moving on to these led headlights drls and turn signals the headlight housing itself is very sleek going right off the corner of that grille the drls also have a nice c-shape designed to them underneath the headlights and the high beams with the turn signal in the upper section of the housing definitely gives it a great design for this front end and this even has led fog lights at the very lower section of the corners on both sides there's some chrome trim surrounding those pieces as well just to break it up and this even has a forward-facing sensor which is a part of the adaptive cruise and all that technology and there's very clean lines that run down the hood meeting the top of the grill as well as the top of the headlight housings very nicely and moving on to the side profile this has the upgraded 22 inch wheels with a multi-spoke design as well as a two-tone finish definitely gives it a great luxury look there's a chrome trim piece just behind that leading all the way to the back doors really nice lines flow down the side profile as well as the fender arches too just giving it a great look this has body colored side mirrors with the base of them being finished off in gloss black and it also has a camera as well as the integrated turn signal up on the roof is the full panoramic roof along with the brush trim for the roof racks it's even surrounding the window trim too and there's a really clean line just underneath the height of the door handles and making our way to the rear this has a body colored spoiler with the integrated third brake light gloss plug trim pieces are on both sides just to tie it nicely with the rear glass the wiper blade is mounted in the lower section to give the driver better visibility there's a chrome trim piece connecting both of the led tail lights running right through the middle of this power liftgate where this also has a backup camera right in the middle all the parking sensors are down below as well as the dual exhaust more of that brush trim just to break it up some and this even has a towing capacity around 5 400 pounds very healthy for the size of this vehicle making it very practical to own and then as we move on to the cargo space now you can use the button on the key fob or i can just use the electronic button up underneath bmw and this does have the split style for the liftgate so as you can tell the upper one will automatically open up and then from there you can push on this button on the left side and the lower section will automatically go down so if you're tailgating you'd like somewhere to sit or you just want your load height to be away from the bumper so when you put items in and out you're not going to risk touching the bumper it's a really cool split style design and this is a three row vehicle with the third row currently up there's a good amount of storage space where you can place items if you have this packed full of people underneath the floor is even a lot more storage as well as this removable cover you can store it out of the way if you're not going to use it plenty of room to put even more items and hide them away and then you can also remove this cover and fold the seats down so we're going to start off with the third row seating over on this driver's side if i just hold on both of these buttons the headrests will automatically fold down if they're already up and then by holding on these buttons they will fold down giving you a lot more storage in the back if you do have second row passengers now the two buttons in front of that if i hold on these it will just move the second row forward and then you cannot actually fold the second row completely flat you can however move them out of the way giving you a little bit more space and then if you just want to push on one button we have maximum storage and maximum people so if i push on max storage the third row will fold down the second row will slide forwards maximum people will bring everything back up and then to close the lift gates you can push this button on the left side which is the one to open it the one on the right side will actually lower the rear end of this vehicle so like i mentioned earlier with the load height now you have a much lower load height in order to put items in and out and up top is lock on one side if i push the one on the left side it will close both of them at once so it's nice to have that one button to do both of those tailgates and now let's work our way to the back seating where you can lock and unlock the vehicle using this door handle which is great to see and this interior leather is called tarduffo it's a really nice brown with all the dark stitching the window control is finished off in brushed aluminum as well as all the sunshade adjustments which i'll show later the release handle is finished off in brushed aluminum this even has the interior ambient lighting package with more brushed aluminum some wood trim plenty of storage space in the lower section of the door as well as one of the speakers and now moving our way to the third row with the second row seating all i need to do is pull on that tab and the seat will automatically make its way forwards giving me plenty of room to hop into this third row so at five foot ten i have plenty of space and there are captains chairs for the second row seating so there's a little bit of space in between and as you can tell there is plenty of foot room the second row also slides forwards and backwards so if you need a little bit more room you can adjust those as needed and i have around an inch or so above my head so it's actually pretty spacious i could be back here and right around town maybe go on a quick trip the third row passengers even have that ambient lighting as well as an armrest and a cup holder and then a pretty good amount of visibility even with that pillar there you can easily see out there's some nice alcantara on parts of the headliner it's even covering the entire upper section as well there's also climate controls back here so there's air vents as well as having heated seats where you'd like there to go temperature controls all of that for your third row even a sunroof so it's great to see that for your third row passengers there are definitely a lot of amenities now going back to the second row if i put that seat all the way back it will automatically slide back to the position that it was in so it's great to see that and while it's still moving i'm going to go ahead and make my way into the seat where i have plenty of room the front seat is also adjusting back to where that was so everything will go back to where it was set and i can further slide this seat back to give me a little bit more leg room and again at 5 foot 10 plenty of room i have a few inches above my head as well and these seats are all automatic so you can also recline them and just be a little bit more comfortable in the back of your x7 with your adjustable armrest that you can lock into place which is of course great to see and then right in the middle we have the second row seating adjustments for the heated seats all of the other buttons for the ac as well as that small screen there are two air vents along with a little bit of storage space underneath you could place your phone or other items and then there's a 12 volt along with two usbs two cup holders in the floor and x7 is just behind that there's also more charging ports behind the front seats and an area where you could hook up an attachment to place a tablet so you could be in the second row watch a movie or something if you're on a trip there's even some storage bins behind both front seats as well and then like i mentioned earlier over on the door panel are all these sunshade adjustments the one on the upper left will control this door of course and you can put it up and down the one on the right side will adjust the passenger one so you can quickly put that up and down on the back left if i push on this one this is actually for the entire sun shade so you can open and close that if you'd like to from the second row and then the last one you can use this to adjust the one for the third row passengers so you can be as comfortable as you want in the back seats and just to take a look at that interior ambient lighting while we do have some shade it's currently purple it's a really nice touch and before we move on to the front seats this x7 does have remote start so in order to activate that all i need to do is push on the lock button three times in a row and it will automatically start up which is a really nice feature to have and if you do want to shut it off for whatever reason simply just triple tap that button again and it will shut off and then from there i can unlock the vehicle the door handle is just like the rear one of course so you can use that to lock it and the door panel is finished off in that same brown leather with all the stitching brushed aluminum all the controls for the side mirror adjustments even the memory seating adjustments you can adjust the passenger seat being able to move them forwards and backwards this even has massaging seats really nice to see that all the wood trim tons of storage space in the lower section of that door and then moving on to these front seats they have a great design just like the rest of the seating obviously and all the buttons to control this seat are down on the side of course and at 5 foot 10 it's very easy to hop into the front seats door sill is very low and then making your way to the steering wheel completely covered in solid black leather with black stitching more brushed aluminum this is even a heated steering wheel and then on the left side is all the cruise and adaptive cruise control settings on the right side is volume and tuning as well as bluetooth and voice commands but let's fire this x7 back up with my foot on the brake that button is down below and we can bring this back to life and coming back to the stage gauge cluster on the left side is the fuel gauge as well as miles per hour on the right side is the attack in the engine temperature the navigation is also being shown right in the middle so it's great to have that and then within the tach you can go through a lot more information using this button on the top of the turn signal stock so currently it's showing the driving mode as well as what gear the vehicle is in if i push on it once we can also pull up the average mpg you can pull up some data information if you'd like to monitor that as well as live readouts for horsepower and torque so if i give the vehicle some gas those will adjust as needed there's also the g-force meter that you can look at as well as music this does also feature brushed aluminum on the steering wheel mounted paddle shifters so you can use those if you'd like to and then over on the left side there's a good amount of storage space down below where you could place any items if you'd like to all the headlights parking lights and fog light adjustments are right there as well as a dimmer switch for the gauges more of that brushed aluminum and wood trim this even has the heads-up display so it's showing the speed limit sign as well as the miles per hour and then right in the middle is this massive touch screen system you can go through a lot of information currently this is on the home screen where it will show up your navigation along with music and phone i can swipe over look at some more data information as well as the traffic and the compass even pull up the date the news any weather information you'd like to look at and then on this left side is all the presets which are fixed i'm going to use all the controls to further go through that info so they're shortcuts to a map and navigation as well as home media and phone the rotary dial in a few buttons just underneath that so by using that rotary dial on this left side you can see a media and phone if i click on navigation you can pull that up in full screen to go through all that info going into car now there's a lot more information to go through from your driving information you can go into sport display so if you want to monitor this information in your x7 you can which is kind of cool to see going into xview now you can pull up the suspension level as well as the compass look at your degrees as well as your altitude pretty neat to be able to monitor that information there's also energy flow as well vehicle status will go through some general information if you want to monitor any of that and settings has everything that you'd like to configure from your interior ambient lighting your climate control you can adjust the remote start if you want to have that on or not the different driving modes your driver assistance there is a lot of information to configure you can also pull up your owner's manual if you'd like to and just underneath that there's another interior ambient lighting strip running just above this wood trim and there's more brushed aluminum surrounding that there's even a shortcut to the intelligent safety so if we go into this you can configure everything from the forward collision the side collision lane departure blind spot steering intervention all that information is quickly accessible and then moving on to more of these controls there's two air vents right in the middle is all the ac controls finished off in brushed aluminum this has a dual zone system so there's temperature and fan speed for driver and passenger this even has heated front seats so those controls are on both sides with more of their recirc and where you'd like there to go making your way below that are all the presets for the audio as well as power and volume tuning is on that right side and at the very bottom is a wireless charging pad on the back side along with a 12-volt and a usb there's two cup holders you can even chill these as well or heat them depending on the drink that you have really cool to see that if i close this up there's even more wood trim more brushed aluminum and that interior ambient lighting strip even adjustment for the suspension for the ride height so i can push on that raise this vehicle all the way up and you will see you can get a little bit more ground clearance as well if you need it there's a downhill assist control as well as the electronic parking brake and then over on this left side are all the different driving modes so if i click on this once we have sport and sport individual the one underneath it is comfort you will see the gauge cluster change there's even eco pro and eco pro individual and the last one is the adaptive mode so just depending on how you want the vehicle to drive it will automatically adapt to the conditions and then also over on this left side is traction control parking sensors can be turned on and off and then there's even a shortcut to the camera system so talking about this 3d camera system this is the rear facing camera right now as you can see it's in full screen if i put the vehicle into reverse now we have the top down view over on the right side with a few shortcuts so you can see around the exterior of this vehicle if i swipe over now we have the 3d view you can use your hand with the gesture control or just push on these buttons here and you can see exactly what's around the entire exterior giving you no visibility issues the last one is the car wash setting or you can use this when you're pulling into a parking space to give you that top-down view if you need it this even has the automatic parking so it will help you in parallel parking and the backup assistance with this shifter too it's finished off in crystal which is a really nice touch park is also on the back side if i go down into drive and pop it over into the manual setting that's how you can shift using this or the steering wheel mounted paddle shifters as needed and then just behind that we have the armrest i can open up that split design just by pushing on that button there's a usbc so you can charge electronics in there if needed and over on the glove box side plenty of room for all of that information we'll take one last look at this interior very beautiful spec for this x7 and up top we have that sunroof so i can easily open that up this even has some technology in the sunroof itself so it can dim to take some of that lighting out just to protect you a little bit more up top there's even the dome lights and we can adjust some of the other sunshades as well so as we get behind the wheel of this 2022 a bmw x7 now this is a very ultra luxurious jumbo suv that has so much to offer for all of your passengers there's a lot of amenities even all the controls for your third row passengers makes it enjoyable to be all the way in the back which is great to see this has the massaging seats which i didn't talk about too much but if i push on this button i can go through the shoulder lumbar upper body whole body go through different levels you can be comfortable while you're driving this around along with that adaptive suspension just to give you the ultimate driving machine and make it very comfortable at the same time now with that being said i can pop it over into the manual setting i need to shut off the massaging seats there we'll give it some gas in third gear and not only are the paddles incredibly responsive for the size of this vehicle it will get up and move now that was a light acceleration as we come around this turn just going at a normal rate of speed i mean it handles its weight well i love how bmws drive especially with the top dog here the x7 handles well just going at a normal speed it's not a performance oriented vehicle however you can get some higher trim levels if you want a little bit more performance and now as we switch over to the pov angle you can see what it's like to be behind the wheel of this x7 and how luxurious it is from the driver's seat so i currently have it in the normal setting we are still in comfort mode and like i mentioned it is so nice to drive very smooth and as far as visibility goes looking over this right shoulder i can see all the way to the back even like i mentioned earlier with that pillar it's not really all that bulky so it is easy to see in all directions and we have that 3d camera system if you need a little bit more visibility and then giving it an acceleration from first just a mild acceleration and there are no power issues this can definitely handle its weight with the amount of power that it has to offer and talking about the adaptive crews while we have some vehicles in front of us i can quickly set it i can also push on the mode button so we can go between the distance control as well as the assisted driving which is currently on and now the distance control just by using plus and minus i can control how close i want to be to the vehicles i can also monitor my speed and then with the assisted driving it's going to take this turn for me now i will say with the assisted driving it's not going to take very tight corners so obviously you need to have your hands on the wheel and paying attention it's mainly for being out on the highway just to keep you in your lane and centered but it's still a phenomenal system this is the full adaptive cruise as well so if the traffic in front of me came to a stop this vehicle would come to a complete stop and then proceed as the traffic started moving but that's going to wrap it up for this 2022 a bmw x7 xdrive40i once again huge shout out to hendrickbmw northlake

52;BMW;2022 BMW X7;Is the 2022 BMW X7 M50i a BETTER luxury sport SUV than a Cadillac Escalade?;[Music] hey guys what's up it's joe radio from radius rise i'm back here at bmw of tampa and guess what we have that full-size performance suv standing right next to me this is it this is a 2022 bmw x7 m50i but before we get into this super sized super powerful suv let's talk about what's going on here bmw they've been doing the business in the auto industry since 1933 if you could believe that but before that they made motorcycles and airplanes and airplane engines but since 1933 really laid down the road work for making an iconic brand now obviously it's always been about bmw sedans bmw coupes and sports cars so many championships they even dabbled in formula one but you know what 21st century what really sells and sells in a big way are suvs and bmw decided to enter that full-size suv segment now the x7 has been around for a few years there's been some mild changes here and there but is this the luxury suv to buy over some of the longer staying mainstays in this segment ideally the lincoln navigator and the cadillac escalade so i want to get into this m50i talk about its performance talk about what it brings to the luxury table but find out is it the better luxury suv than the mighty cadillac escalade let's go ahead dive in and find out what our 2022 x7 right off the bat the style even though this is super size you're getting that traditional bmw style now at the front of the business you'll notice good size on the headlight housing but nothing too obnoxious on the interior getting those bmw laser lights watch out they might zap you i love the daytime running lamps especially the way they did that signature halo design and then of course you're going to get the turn signals as well dropping down i hope you like functionality because you're getting massive corner openings that are going to bring nice cool air into the heat exchangers and a side air curtain and you have full led fog lamps love this satin steel finish look that they have around the air curtain a little bit of gloss black but nothing too crazy and bmw always does a great job no matter what the vehicle on how they extend that lower front fascia so that there's not a bunch of stuck on appendages to increase aerodynamic efficiency now as we climb across that massive grill even though this is a massive suv i really feel like the grills on the 3 series like the m3 and the m4 are larger than this vehicle but that kidney shape fits it pretty well you do have a forward-facing camera which is a nice touch and like i said the satin steel finish with the vertical slots you do have active arrow that's going to open and close and i've always liked how they do the hood design and it kind of just comes to a nice point there now dropping down you do have some gloss black looks good brand new not sure how it's going to look down the road but you have more functionality and i like the way they took this lower lip and it extended down another little design feature i've always liked about bmws is this lower grill area is almost like separate from the rest of the front fascia really gives it a nice identity now when you get up onto that massive hood what do we got a massive bmw badging flavor flay would be proud to hang this around his neck instead of that clock that's how large it is but you do have those clean german lines everything going right towards the windshield we come around the bend what are we working with wheel and tire setup just like this suv is big we got some big wheels and tires what are we looking at these are 22-inch wheels so 22-inch wheel love the machined aluminum that gunmetal metallic gray the bmw badge in the center look at those calipers they're the size of ice skates that's how large those calipers are nice metallic blue with the m badge now this is not a true m vehicle but being an m50i it does bring extra performance not only underneath the hood but also when it comes to braking capability massive rotors the size of a super-sized pumpkin with those rotors fully ventilated and we have air suspension that's also going to help with the overall ride quality and handling adaptive dampers all four corners this is technology learned from the race tracks and brought to your street going vehicles like this x7 love the way they paint that beautiful pearlescent white all the way around the fender opening and as we come around you do have this side fender vent my only zonk is it's not functional but i do like the way they flare out that satin steel look and look at the body line how it just drops down and goes along the bottom of the door with that trim all the way back almost looks like a big hockey stick but anyways that really helps with the style from the side nice satin steel look on your mirror caps you're gonna have 360 degree cameras the good news about this suv it's not as large as an escalade and i kind of like that and i really like some of the nice curves that this has compared to the more blocky transformer design of a robot that the escalade is now up top we do have these gloss black raised roof rails gloss black around the trim both top and bottom color match mirror caps and you can see those body lines really shows motion even though there's no motion here now the great news is looking at the back with these rear tires you're looking at 315 315 on the width of these rear tires that's as wide as my shelby gt350rs rear tires and you're still going to get substantial brakes in the back and like i said that x drive on an x7 you got x drive get the power to the ground all four wheels coming around the back what do we got we got a nice simple clean design i wish it had a little bit longer roof spoiler just something that kind of extended out a little bit more that way we would be able to get rid of this rear wiper because that would just really make the back super sexy but i love the m badge like i said not a true m car but you are getting more performance m50i there's that satin steel look with the x7 badge and then dropping it like it's hot all the way to the bottom nice sim simple simulated rear diffuser you do have those massive exhaust outlets and guess what they're actually hiding dual pipes not just single pipes so you have quad pipes two pipes on each end on each side and then you've got the decorative trim ring but while we go ahead we're talking about power let's pop the hood and see what's powering this except guys we got the hook popped you do have hydraulic hood struts now what's interesting comparing this to the escalade the escalade does have a v8 you can get that 6.2 liter with 426 horsepower but guess what we have a v8 under here but things are a little different check it out sexy engine compartment you can see all the bracing that they have and i'm telling you right now that engine cover is just doing things to me in a very very good way love the m performance badge love that bmw logo but what we're looking at underneath that plastic cover you're looking at a twin turbo v8 so 4.4 liter twin turbo v8 523 horsepower 553 pound-feet of torque it is mated to a zf 8-speed automatic transmission 0-60 in 4.5 seconds with that all-wheel drive obviously gonna have that quicker performance than the escalade the vehicle weighs 5 700 pounds mpgs 15 in the city 21 on the highway and this is the nice thing is that if you want your naturally aspirated power you could go that route with an escalade if you go this route though with the m50i you're getting smaller displacement but the addition of twin turbos but while we go ahead let's fire up this m50i and hear what it sounds like [Applause] all right guys here we are in this 2022 bmw x7 m50i i know you're seeing yourself well joe i've been looking at your full-size suvs i've been really focusing in on the two like you said escalade and navigator i thought about the grand wagoneer but i'm gonna pass on that one but i am liking the style and the performance of this x7 m50i how much is it so msrp for the way that this one is optioned is right around 105 695 let's see what you get for the money to the door panel so you have two tone material nice dark tan with the black i love the soft top touch up top you do have two memory seat settings which are great and you also have massage seat settings which are even better harman kardon sound system a little bit of wood finish and then if you look closely with that silver trim there's that ambient lighting that's going to shine through that you could change every which way from roy g biv door pocket is very large very unique shape though so maybe when you go to jimmy john's you're gonna have to be creative with what size subs you put in there but you should at least be able to put two jimmy john subs in there and a bottle of surge or jolt cola to wash it all down now going from the door panel to the dash same high luxury feel look at the stitch work soft touch material more of that nice open pour wood and ambient lighting and it all flows nicely right into this guy right here what are we looking at we're looking at a 12.3 inch digital display for your infotainment it's got apple carplay android auto navigation it's got obviously the hand gesturing movements that you could do to make adjust adjustments touch screen of course you go right to home you can go into your car settings and what's awesome is that they actually have a white m50i there's those functional massive vents on both sides let me show you also you could change the mode so this is comfort nice balance setting we could go into sport my favorite part is watch this sport plus race track time that's going to give us the most performance and you can also like i said you adjust all of the parameters of suspension the whole nine yards you go into vehicle status we could check tire pressure engine oil all that good stuff we got the aok it's green just like the incredible hulk and then we're right back to where it started so very nicely done i'm gonna throw it into reverse super clear on the resolution 360 degree uh camera you got automated parking backup assistance we could go into camera and just check and make adjustments to contrast the whole nine yards and then get right back to where you started easy peasy look at this you have that tft digital display with your dual climate temperature readouts of course we're going to have ventilated seats and heated seats slim and trim on the radio controls more of that open pore wood and ambient lighting and then watch this you ready boom wireless charging two cupholders a usb and a place for about 10 atomic fireballs no joke that's how much you can put in there and then you just close it up one two three look at that this is going to control that zf 8-speed automatic we got of course the idrive controller with the latest software there are our buttons start stop and assuming star stop of the engine and you have your different modes which are very nice plus you can raise and lower your x7 all by the flip of a switch very tastefully done look at this nice soft you ready for the bombay doors bombs away so what do we got in here you got some felt lining you could put your iphone 47 not gonna get scratch and a usb close it up seats leather i wanna thank all the cows out there those german cows thank you look at the beautiful stitch work nice soft material the bolstering ventilated heated and of course you got all that electric assistance for the passenger and the driver and we have that massive massive panoramic sunroof goes all the way back even for the third row passengers but why don't you get your butt over here i want to show you behind this beautiful m leather wrapped steering wheel and our xz guys we're in this high-end luxury suv web performance come on into the business end i love the way you're greeted by this very tasteful aluminum sill plate with the m50i badge that's gonna light up led at night and then check out the foot box right out of a bmw race car nice large dead pedal brake and throttle all aluminum trim which is gonna be super nice just to look at let alone feel and then you got your seat controls of course you're gonna have two memory seat settings and like i also mentioned they are massage seats i got plenty of room in here and i'm wrapped in leather alcantara everywhere even on the headliner and then look at this steering wheel bmw does a fantastic steering wheel heated wheel of course with the heated wheel button right there and then of course you're gonna have some nice aluminum finish the m badging thick 10 and two notches beautiful stitch work on that horn so much history on that bmw badge paddles pretty good size i just wish they were metal so i am going to zonk these they would be nice to be metal in a 105 000 suv electric tilt and telescoping steering wheel and then you got that 12 inch digital display with all your information that you need nicely laid out and you have a head up display which is super sized as well but why don't we go ahead we talked about how great it is up here let's get into that mid row and see how your passengers are going to enjoy this except guys here we are in the mid row and the great news is your passengers are going to have a ton of room like i said lots of nice natural light could be brought in from that massive size panoramic sunroof here's some of the touches you're going to get that i love i think it's so smart the way they have ac vents right in the frame rail for the mid-rope passengers but there's also another set you have soft touch material usb c conveniently placed so you don't have wires hanging everywhere nice size rear seat pocket large enough to where you could put two german size cinnamon rolls back here and if you don't know what german size is the reason why i point that out it's 10 inches in diameter put two of those back there another thing that's super sized is going to be this command center rear ac heated seats but no ventilated seats and that to me is a zonk but i do like the dual climate control nice easy adjustment you have plenty of room here for about 15 tootsie rolls usb cs on the bottom and a 12 volt i got plenty of leg room over here and another thing i want to point out is new for 2022 there's some switch gear back here that makes life a little easier on last year's model i would manually have to lift the security shade not anymore you just push the button it rises up and you have all your switch gear right here i want it to go down watch this goes right down i could even control the sunroof the panoramic sunroof shade which look at that i don't have to bother the driver easy peasy lemon squeezy i want it back again do it yourself that's what you can tell your kids they say mom can you open the sun shade do it yourself we spent the money we got the extra technology speaking of technology good old-fashioned arm rest hard as a old german scone sitting in the sun but the good news is open it up you got felt lining to put skittles and the great news is your kids can look at the rainbow as they taste the rainbow talk about living their best life right open up the cup holder two cup holders oh you gotta have to do that to put it back almost forgot flap that down and then on top of that instead of manual seats you actually have electric assist so the buttons are on the side for your passengers behind the driver i have my own buttons here on my side and you can see just how much movement watch this you ready oh yeah so you could tilt it back we could tilt it up real nice to have that electric cyst assist back when i was a kid you couldn't even move the rear seats you just had to sit there just like you were but let's go ahead let's get in the third row and see how this x7 competes with the mighty escalade alright guys where in the world is joe rady from ratey's rides he is in this third row of the x7 now if you're comparing this to the escalade this is where the escalade is going to win hands down i literally to be able to fit back here had to move this seat all the way forward and you could see that yeah i have some room but my knees are too high especially compared to the new escalade which has that updated independent rear suspension your rear passenger that third row their knees are going to be much much lower the good news is i got plenty of alcantara to make up for it nice and soft and you have your own little sunroof back here that really makes the third row passengers feel really loved at the end of the day one thing that it's going to be hard for lori to show is that i actually have ac controls heated seats on the third row no ventilated seats but here's another little fancy feature watch this you got tie down locations for seats but you also have a usbc underneath this nice lid boom ambient lighting and rear ac vents so i mean pretty good spoiling of the third row but you're just going to spoil the person in the escalade a little bit more with room actually fancier back here in the third row than the escalade but not as much room but let's go ahead let's get into that cargo area and see what we could stuff in this exit guys tail on the business obviously very important for people especially going this big on an suv how much size do you have so you're just going to hit the button nice electric assist raises up this has that split setup so what's nice is that you could put some groceries in and this will hold everything in but if you want to drop the loading platform you just hit that button drops down nicely now what are we looking at you're looking at around 13 cubic feet of space with those rear seats up and if you look on the interior here let me show you what's going on we got all of our switch gear conveniently placed to fold down not only the third row but also the second row you got led lighting on the passenger side look what we have here you got more led lighting and of course we got a cargo net for a small box of snickers but let's show you how these seats fold down it's actually quite simple we're just going to push and we're going to wait a couple seconds look at that right on cue does you love when a plan comes together and those are going to fold down very nicely now you fold down that mid row you'll have 90 cubic feet of space now the good news is you'll have 90 cubic feet of space the bad news is not as much space as the cadillac escalade cadillac escalade you fold everything down has over a hundred cubic feet of space but while we go ahead i'm gonna get this all sorted back here but if you're ready i'm ready let's go on throttle in our x7 m50i all right guys typical florida weather no matter what time of the year it could rain at any given notice but you know what that's okay because we got all-wheel drive even though we got all this power and i'm ready to merge on the highway on throttle here we go unbelievable just how effectively this thing not only produces power but gets the power to the ground very fast shifts faster shifting than the 10 speed in the cadillac escalade and definitely more power even with the twin turbo setup i'm actually quite impressed with how linear the torque delivery is that's what makes it even more amazing is that you're not waiting for the boost to come in now being a bmw especially the x7 you're getting some awesome sounding material the thickness of the acoustic glass all of that is going to create a very serene environment and you're getting just a hint of that v8 roar nothing too crazy a couple pops here and there but that's about it getting to the infotainment system with the hand gesture movements very easy to do as you can see florida drivers just uh out of control especially in the in the wet like y-o-y but uh the leather seats are so comfortable especially with massage head-up display and tons of visibility really really that good guys are thrilled dead stop here we go not even a hint not even a whimper of traction loss from this x drive system in the x7 m50i and i'm telling you right now you're going to embarrass navigator and escalade owners that are trying to get to football practice first because this x7 it really is a powerhouse yet has all these fine finishes the wood the technology i guess the only thing that's really hurting are the people in the third row compared to the competition all right guys we're gonna make a u-turn here show off how simple that is just gotta be careful make sure people are paying attention but easy peasy lemon squeezy on throttle here we go this thing is ridiculous for a vehicle that is big as this one is with the amenities but yet can just fire off the shifts so rocket fast handling is superb even in the wet even in the wet the confidence is there and it just shows how they bring all that technology to the table all that engineering to the table for you so that you can have really that ultimate driving experience that bmw is known for but going down the highway even over these concrete expansions it's such a smooth complacent ride and really just inspires confidence it really really does no matter what the weather is doing but hopefully this gave you a nice overall feel about what the x7 m50i brings to the table we're gonna get back to bmw tampa and wrap this one up so i'll see in a split second hey guys it's been one heck of a day here at bmw tampa i definitely got to thank alex and the rest of the team getting us access to this 2022 bmw x7 on top of that m50i maybe not as much interior room as a cadillac escalade but boy oh boy what's underneath that hood definitely has an advantage let me know what you think are you going bmw style that german euro style with your full-size suv are you going to go more to escalade route put it in the comments section

53;BMW;2022 BMW X7;2022 BMW X7 M50i: Woah! This Is Way Nicer Than I Expected!;so let's see what this has whoa hey everyone it's ben hardy here in today's video i'll be reviewing a bmw x7 m50i first and foremost though a huge shout out and thank you to the bmw of pleasant grove utah for giving me some time with this x7 now something that i absolutely love about the bmw pleasant growth is they do not charge any markups on their vehicles which is super rare in the luxury market because almost every single luxury dealership is charging massive premiums on their vehicles not here at pleasant grove so if you're going to buy a new bmw definitely reach out to them i'll include a link to their inventory in the description down below and then on a side note if you don't save time and money the next time you purchase a car link to my carbine guide in the description down below as well let's get into the video [Music] so under the hood we have a twin turbo 4.4 liter v8 that goes to an eight-speed automatic transmission power outputs are 523 horsepower and then 553 pound-feet of torque and i love how you have the m performance logo with carbon fiber beautiful display overall and you guys got to remember this is ultimately like a family vehicle with over 500 horsepower it's epic now let's go to the front end of the x7 so first off you guys can see the bmw logo front and center and then coming here to the side you've got bmw signature headlights here and just look how cool it is with like the blue trim inside and notice that it says bmw laser there on the side as well and then coming down here you can see the fog lights we've got some venting with the parking sensors integrated in the front and then this we got the signature kidney grill here with a camera there at the bottom and overall this looks really good actually now popping to the side here we've got two 75 millimeter tires wrapped around 22 inch wheels in the front and then 315 millimeter tires wrapped around 22 inch wheels in the back and then if we look at the wheels from a design perspective you've got the silver here on the top and you got the metallic gray below that then you guys can see the size of the rotors here and you've got the bmw m colored blue calipers which again look really cool and then notice here with the fender flare how that's body painted and then you have this cool like accent piece right here that continues there kind of like along the side and if we take a few steps back they've kept everything pretty neutral so the wheels pop out but then all the rest of the trim is all blacked out so that everything just matches from a side view perspective so here's our key fob we have our unlock function lock function and the opening here for the hatch so you press that and it'll pop right open and this has my favorite style of hatch it's got a tailgate hatch so notice that we can actually lower the rear end of the vehicle so it makes loading things a little bit easier but you can just press that to lower this down which is pretty cool and got this nice like cloth trim here so you can actually sit on it which is really cool we have the floor mats here in the back and you can see for the third row passengers they actually get really nice a lot of trim to rest their arms on and a cup holder as well which is pretty cool and then also got a bunch of controls right here for the uh seats basically to adjust everything and so something that i recommend just to play with if you buy an x7 and then you'll kind of figure out everything and then notice the well storage space underneath there we got all the floor mats on top of it so it's kind of hard to reach and then when you are done i'm gonna see if you can just press this if it'll do it all yeah look it does it all together that's cool now finishing things up with the rest of the rear you guys can see the rails there at the top and then notice we got our m50i badge and i really like the taillights here on the x7 and then of course we got our x7 badge there parking sensors here at the bottom and we've got a receiver hitch here and then look at the exhaust tips on either side we'll talk about tone capacity and payload capacity in a moment but there's the rear now here's the door panel here you guys can see here with the leather trim at the top and then down below i love the two-tone design we've got some controls here for like these sunshades for example window control speakers for the bowers and wilkins sound system which again i love the display we of course have our m plaque and then look we got pillows on the headrests now i don't know if this actually comes from the factory but this is still very uh nice and plush and then notice here with the design on the seats i think that is really cool we have power adjustments here for the rear seats and this is actually to help raise and lower the seats which is kind of cool you have those controls and notice there's even like look at that it's padded there that's crazy and then really nice headliner too we'll talk about that later but popping inside you can see legroom and then notice we got some charging ports right here we got some behind the seat storage some vents we've got the climate controls here for the rear they have a dual zone here in the back heated seats for the rear passengers and then we got some more charging ports more cup holders really family friendly and then notice we got our armrests which you can move up and down if you so desire and then as for the rest of the rear uh with the third row you can very comfortably fit uh kids back there uh no problem whatsoever adults you can fit them back there in a pinch but it's not as comfortable and then you can see here with the ambient lighting for the back passengers which is another cool little feature now here's the door panel at the front again notice with the leather trim and then down below we've got all of our window controls right here and then the mirrors to do power fold in and they've got blind spot monitoring and then notice we got memory seats right here we have massaging seats as well and you got this for the rear seats there's just so many like seat adjustment controls here in the x7 and then you can see here with the front seats nice pillows here for the headrests and then notice the design here perforated as well and then you've got your adjustments here on the side of the seat and all that notice the pedals look really nice you got the light controls here steering wheel is power adjustable and let's pop in [Music] now here is the steering wheel for the x7 you can see really nice leather all around and the air bag cover is covered as well so it looks beautiful get your heated steering wheel control here paddle shifters for that eight-speed automatic got your turn signal stock windshield wiper stock and then also we have our cruise control with steering assistance as well and yeah overall nice setup now we've got the full digital gauge cluster here notice you got the speed there on the one side and then you got the rpms on the other side and of course they remind you that you have the m50i version of the x7 now we do have some different drive modes so we've got like our adaptive for example and we have our eco pro which notice how changes the gauge cluster comfort and we have our sport plus mode that you can go into and then you have sport individual as well and they have sport regular so we have a bunch of different sport modes uh basically and yeah overall i think they did a great job with the gauge cluster love how you have like the navigation screen built in and all that and it's just a cool setup now here's the infotainment system first off the most important thing is i gotta turn on the massage function we got level three we're gonna do whole body exercise and uh yeah we're gonna get off to a fun time so first off popping into reverse you can see the backup camera which does have trajectory lines they do turn with the steering wheel we've got a bunch of different camera viewpoints here out of the x7 which is fantastic uh so it's just really solid system overall resolution is fantastic now as for the rest of the infotainment system you can control it with a dial if you want you've got like the shortcut bar here on the side you've got the main screen right here a response time if you use it as a touch screen is fantastic it's really easy to use it's actually intuitive and there's so many shortcut buttons here on the side and then also down below i'll show you as well that it's just it's a great system and so if you like having analog buttons but then also touch screen buttons then this has it all for you speaking of shortcut buttons we have this for the safety tech you got the hazard lights and then we have our climate controls right here i just have everything synchronized which you can access via the menu button and then you can go through the climate menu cooled seats heated seats as well it's all in the same button which is uh pretty cool ah see what i did there and then we've got our analog controls here for like the radio stuff and uh you've got the presets which if i just hover my finger over the presets it actually goes over and this does have bmw's gesture control where i can do the volume with my finger if i want which is another cool feature and then if we press this tab here it'll open up and it'll show us our wireless phone charger got some storage space in here as well and then we've got some cup holders right here which notice that you can actually cool the cup holders which is also cool i am just full of uh dad jokes today i suppose when you're done you can just cover that up like that now this is that analog control is telling you for the infotainment system it's this cool crystal shifter and then you've got all the shortcut buttons around it we've got the suspension to raise and lower it right here via this function we've got hill descent control as well we've got our parking brake we've got our auto hold all of our drive modes here in this area nice crystal shifter here and does have a manual shift function and then look at the engine stop start button and then got your auto stop start here your parking sensors that's for the camera the stability control and i just love how this looks very high end but going from that to the center console area you can see a pretty normal center console setup a nice leather here on top of it and then notice with the dash again just completely covered in leather so again has that luxury car feel to it and then you can see here with the glove box set up on it and the handle on the glove box is very nice and i just love how this interior looks again with the two-tone design it's just really really cool but popping here to the top we do have a full panoramic center as you can see premium headliner as well control for the center if it's just right here in the center and again just material used throughout is top notch now if you want the most update price on this particular x7 just check out bmw of pleasant grove's website in the description down below let's take it out and see how it drives well before we talk about visibility let's quickly talk about the payload and towing capacity uh so we have almost 1500 pounds of payload capacity and we have almost 6 000 pounds of towing capacity so super solid there's visibility of the hood you guys can see the heads up display both the mirrors they do have blind spot monitoring and then throughout the rest of the rear and let's set off so setting off in the x7 m50i this is such a cool vehicle if you ask me because again ultimately this is a third rest should be it's a family vehicle but man does this have some flare it looks really cool and on top of looking really cool it's i mean you guys heard the exhaust clip this thing sounds amazing again you don't expect to hear those noises to come from a family vehicle and we're gonna of course pop on our massage seat function got the upside down sign i guess that means you have to cross like a go across but you have to do it on your head you can't do it with your feet i think i think that's what that says so if you guys do that crosswalk uh without doing a handstand then you're breaking the wall um but anyways back to the x7 the seats are really comfortable in this bmw did a really so like solid job with these seats um bolstering is wide so if you're a bigger person you'll be able to fit in the seats they've got really good padding and again the massage seat function is just like the icing on the cake and there's so much adjustment with these seats too that like there's you know just something for everyone like you will for sure be able to find like a set up with these seats that just works for you now ride quality and road noise we're not going super fast so i comment just a little bit on road noise it seems like it's pretty well insulated and the ride quality is very smooth that's something that i've noticed with bmw's newer vehicles uh that are on their like newer platforms is they just are all so smooth whether it's a full-blown m car or something like this that you know was like it's still got em in the name but it's more of like on the luxury side of things it's still really smooth and look how it just took that big bump right uh just anything and coming down here too it's just like like i mean you feel it but it's it's really not it's like it's comfortable it's the best way to put it so i think that bmw's done a great job with this you know from a luxury daily driver uh perspective hey so let's see what this has now this is a family car i can get behind that is just in the manual mode it's pretty it's pretty cool yeah this is a family car i can get behind look at that even in the sport plus setting the suspension's super compliant this thing is fun wow it sounds great it's quick i mean that is quick so you know like if you got to get the kids to soccer practice really really quick like this this will do it won't have to worry about being late to anything with this thing um yeah let's let's sum things up i'm gonna put it back into the comfort setting balance settings what it describes comfort as uh so first off i think the x7 looks great sometimes third row suvs just look ugly frankly because they like it it's just like they take like most manufacturers will take like the styling they have on like a you know smaller suv and they just stretch it out and it just doesn't quite look right bmw's made this work with the x7 it looks really good interior full-on luxury car it's just really nice materials everywhere and the seats are comfortable it's got massaging seats heated cool seats i mean what more could you ask for frankly so they've done an amazing job with the interior and then from a driving perspective it does luxury car stuff um and sound system's amazing too on this so that's another big plus that is fast and it's fun like it just ticks all the boxes so you know if you um want to do some fun spirited driving while you got the kiddos in the back you can do that with the x7 it'll let you do that yeah this is this is definitely a cool suv there you go that's going to something's up for our video on this bmw x7 m50i again a huge shout out thank you to the bmw of pleasant girl for giving me some time with this x7 check out the inventory in the description down below i'll see all of you in that next video
54;BMW;2022 BMW X7;2022 BMW X7 Review;[Music] hello everyone nick cordellini here with bill jacobs bmw in naperville here today to show you this 2022 bmw x7 4.0 i this vehicle does come equipped with bmw x-drive's all-wheel drive system underneath the hood we do have a twin power turbo in-line six-cylinder motor producing 335 horsepower this engine offers plenty of torque as well as horsepower to get the vehicle moving and get you up and going let's go ahead and take a look around the vehicle and see what other features this x7 has alright guys starting off looking at the wheels of this bmw x7 these are the standard wheels for this vehicle these are 20 in 21 inch wheel option wrapped in all season tires right behind that we do have a larger brake caliper ensuring that the bmw x7 additional weight will make sure that it stops on a dime everything is a squared setup to ensure that the all-wheel drive system has no sorts of issues when it is going down the road going around to the rear of the vehicle the x7 much like its predecessor the bmw x5 does offer a split tailgate what the split tailgate allows you to do is simply allows more and easier access to the rear load floor by offering a lower entry point into the rear cargo area there is an additional button located right here that will actually even allow you to lower the vehicle to add even heavier items into the rear of the x7 now everyone wonders how does the x7 lower itself the x7 is a standard four corner air suspension which is exclusive specifically to this vehicle being one of the only bmw vehicles that comes standard with four axle air suspension also equipped on this vehicle we do have a tow hitch the tow hitch would allow the vehicle to tow upwards of 7 500 pounds of towing capacity so those boats jet skis or snowmobiles you're looking to take with you on that weekend trip the bmw can bring them right along with you welcome inside the x7 now we're going to take a look at the rear seating surface which is what the x7 is truly most known for the reason for this it is the only bmw currently to come standard with a third row full seating surface to access the third row area simply push the button located on the side one single click the front seat will move forward and the entire second row seating surface will unlatch allowing access to the rear seating compartment in the rear the x7 does have heated third row seating surfaces usb type-c chargers which are located directly below the cover right here as well as ample room for two adults or two children whoever decides to crawl back in the rear once everyone is back simply pushing the button to the rear will then lower the seating surface and lock the second row back into place for safety reasons you'll notice on the inside of the second row area as well passengers do have the option to move that seating surface forward as well as slightly recline the rear the rear part portion of the second row area as well the second row also is heated which is the same as the third row and the first row area and lastly rounding out these the second row area is the travel inconvenience package traveling convenience package the door simply slides to the right hand side allowing bmw approved accessories to be snapped into the rear this would include coat hangers bag holders as well as rear tray tables for more information visit bmwsa.com or visit bill jacobs bmw boutique located right behind this vehicle that we're in right now in the front seat of the vehicle much like every other bmw everything is laid out in a beautiful fashion you have your idrive control system located right here which would include your media communication and navigation infotainment information your climate control system located dead center and then your radio preset buttons located on the lower portion of the vehicle rounding out the dash would be your beautiful 12.2 inch display which gives you information from media to vehicle status all the way up to your mapping system for your navigation system just in just a second here guys we're going to dive in a little bit more into the idrive system as well as the advanced driver safety systems that make the x7 truly light years above everything else now we're going to focus our attention exclusively upon the bmw i drive system bmw i drive system operating version number seven allows the driver an exclusive interaction between you and your vehicle one of the easiest ways and most efficient ways of utilizing the car is through your bmw natural voice recognition voice command systems the voice command system can be operated in two different ways you do have your voice command button located on the right lower hand portion of your steering wheel or even better what if you can just tell the vehicle what you want to say hello bmw navigate to build jacob's bmw perfect our next destination is bill jacobs bmw bill jacobs mini just simply by telling the vehicle where you want to go your hands can stay on the wheel eye is focused on the road and you're ready to go moving on from the idrive system this button located right here is one of the most commonly asked questions what does it do all of our bmw vehicles now come with advanced driver safety assist systems specifically for collision warning for pedestrian warning blind spot detection and lane departure warning certain vehicles even come with steering intervention steering intervention would simply correct the steering if the driver for whatever reason either starts drifting over the lane or tries to maneuver over when there is a vehicle in the blind spot of that car other advanced safety options would include the optional acc stop and go with active cruise control a very fun feature which would be our heated and cooled cup holders which are also available on the x7 as well and then of course just rounding everything out as we mentioned earlier your air ride suspension control this can raise and lower the vehicle you're either giving you more ground clearance to get up those steep driveways or of course in chicago out of your driveway if it snowed about a foot overnight or if you have maybe an elderly individual coming into your vehicle you can then lower the vehicle for easier access into the car all right guys thank you very much for watching if you guys have any further questions please feel free to contact us at bill jacobs bmw in april illinois and if you like this button and you'd like to see more future videos please like and subscribe thank you guys for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music]

55;BMW;2021 BMW X7;2021 BMW X7 xDrive40i Review;hey everyone welcome to the channel my name is steven and today i have one of my favorite cars here with me this is the 2021 bmw x7 x drive 40i i'm here in sunny daytona beach florida you'd see i've got this beautiful beach behind me here unfortunately the tide is actually too high right now so i can't actually drive it on the beach but uh the nice attendant lady over there let me park it as close as i could so today's video i'll be going over a quick review of the car go over the exterior interior tech features and give final thoughts on how the driving experience is so for those of you who aren't familiar with bmw's lineup the x7 debuted in the 2019 model year and has since then become their flagship suv this is a three-row luxury suv if you're called the bmw x5 is actually also offered in a 3-0 configuration but this is much larger than that so on the exterior you can see got some nice 21 inch wheels i feel like they're actually one of my favorite parts of the car got some nice running boards on the bottom to help you get into the large car um this vehicle comes in right around 203 inches long which actually makes it one of the shorter entries in this segment as compared to rivals like the lincoln navigator cadillac escalade which are significantly larger around 210 inches for those starting with the front fascia of the car you can see we've got some gorgeous daytime running lights actually one of my favorite parts of the car as well i feel like these lights look so much better than some other bmw products the lower front fascia you see we've got a lot of vents here and of course the infamous huge kidney grill on this bmw x7 again 21 inch wheels here these are for the base trim the x drive 40i but we do have some upgraded wheels that you can get on the higher up models the back of the car i feel like is is not as exciting pretty typical boxy look for the three row suv segment um but it definitely looks good i feel like the the tail lights i i wish they did the full led light bar thing that a lot of other rivals are doing like the porsche cayenne and of course the navigator so going underneath the hood you've got a turbocharged three liter inline six makes 300 335 horsepower and 331 pound-feet of torque those numbers aren't the highest honestly in the segment the lincoln navigator as well like 400 something but of course this is smaller than that um and this is very similar to the gls which i believe makes a little over 350 horsepower so a little higher than that but this car does feel really torquey when it drives um we can kind of go over to that in the driving part of this review but um yeah the engine is great doesn't make the crazy sounds that you would expect from you know a sports car or anything but super smooth and in the 2021 model year it actually comes with a mild hybrid system which assists in the start stop feature which actually feels super smooth in this car one of the best i've ever felt i actually usually turn off auto start install because i don't like how it you know kicks in the engine and stuff like that but with the mild hybrid system here it's smooth it's super smooth and that's one of my favorite features in the car so far so here's a quick demonstration of the welcome lights in the car as i approach the car the taillights flash to life and you've got the beautiful welcome carpet on the floor as well as illuminated door handles you can also see that the ambient lighting appears in the car here you can check out how much cargo space we have with the third row seats up so you can see really not that much it is kind of nice that the lower lift gate kind of comes out like this you can sit on it it's actually lined with felt which makes it feel very very expensive um but yeah so you've got my one carry-on baggage right here to already um you do have some really cool controls back here though you can actually put down every seat from the back here in the background and what my favorite feature is these max things so this is max passenger which means all the seats go up and then max uh i guess luggage would make all the seats go down which is super cool and obviously you get more space when all the seats are down here you've got the pretty standard kick feature to close or open i'm gonna see if i can get it to work right here i'm not sure if you can really see this oh there it goes now pretty cool pretty nifty little trick there stepping into the interior of the bmw x7 first thing a lot of people will notice just how quiet the car is once you get in can't hear the wind the beach the tide at all you can only see it though with these great windows and this huge panoramic sunroof which does come standard on the base trim you've also got some very large and very high quality 12.3 inch displays you've got the digital gauge cluster right here and a touch screen here as well that you can also control with this rotary dial which is fairly convenient i know a lot of people are complaining about how everything is going touch screen these days but this dial is really really nice works very very well very responsive you've got two cup holders you can see i've got my starbucks drink and a huge really really huge voss glass of water got some storage right here as well you can see i put my sunglasses there because there is actually no sunglass compartment here which is probably one of my biggest pet peeves of recent cars i feel like i see less and less sunglass compartments there is a wireless charging tray right here as well you've got a really gorgeous steering wheel here feels really good the heated steering wheel button is right here very easy to find the controls are super simple you've got cruise control on the left-hand side and you've got all of your other controls on the right for media the interior of this car is a very very nice kind of brownish i feel like it looks really good especially with the white exterior you can see i've actually got the third row seats up right now and the middle row is not the captain's formation which you can get um i believe it's like an 800 up charge or something like that so going into the second row of this three row suv like i just mentioned you can get it in the captain's chair configurations instead of the bench configuration here i would highly recommend getting the captain sure configuration if you do have people who will be utilizing that third row as it's not easy to get there so let me demonstrate really quickly you have these nice buttons they work well but look how slowly this moves it's really taken its sweet time and yeah you can get into the third row now but it's definitely pretty slow and you would have to do the same thing to get out as well so getting into the third row it's not bad it really has a decent leg room i guess you know obviously i'm about five foot eight here and i'm still kind of struggling um but you know it's comfortable back here i do feel like the leather still feels really high quality you've actually got ambient lighting back here as well which is super cool um even got some wood trim here which i feel like makes you feel like you're still in a luxury car you've got some nice cup holders you've even got some um usb ports and everything back here so definitely not a bad place to be it's kind of funny being back here it feels like you're super far away from the the driver's seat i can show you just putting it back in its place pretty simple just click that button it'll do everything for you it actually even moves the front passenger seat for you as well a little bit to make space for everything yep basically locks back into place and slowly moves back to where it was originally one of my favorite parts of the second row seats here is that you actually have power controls not as many way adjustable i think the front are 14 way adjustable but still pretty good for passengers right so you can see here you've also got a really nice set of climate controls this is actually standard quad zone climate control you can do auto back here there's even a nice little digital display here you can actually change the power of the fan and all that sort of good stuff um one of my favorite things about this car actually is that you can change the power of the fan while sticking it on auto which i feel like more cars need to do a lot of cars will immediately adjust the power of the fan based on you know your temperature that you selected to but i really like the fact that this allows you to choose whether or not you want a strong fan or not similar to the third row you've got some usb ports back here and let me show you the sensor armrest so you've got some nice storage in the middle if we can put something back here and then you've got of course two cup holders as well pretty standard but it looks good and it's easy to use the leather again looks really really good this is soft touch plastic but it still feels and looks really luxurious so let's move back to the front of the car where we can go over the tech one of the coolest parts of this car is definitely how many standard features it has even in the base model msrp is at 74 900 us dollars um this one is actually quite close to the base trim probably about 80 000 msrp that's my guess right here i did rent this car from the national car rental at mco airport in orlando and i'm actually going to be returning it later today but wanted to film this car review before i returned it so moving into some of the really cool tech features of course the digital gauge cluster very configurable not quite as good as i would say the audi one but you can definitely do things like look through your apple carplay music you can also set it very easily using these different uh you know controls on the actual steering wheel i feel like this passes every single test in terms of you know having these to skip track having this to increase the volume and everything like that um the other side is just a cruise control unfortunately the base model of this car does not come with adaptive cruise control which i feel like is a little ridiculous given the price of this car and how luxurious it is but um hopefully bmw adds that probably in a pretty pretty close year you've got this button right here on the left turn stock which actually allows you to change what it shows on the right hand side you've got some pretty cool displays here um this car only has 3 800 miles on it total so far uh you can see the horsepower and torque you can see a g-force monitor which is kind of cool um and of course the media which is kind of what i keep it at the middle isn't as configurable which is really where i feel like the gauge cluster loses points compared to the audi but um basically you can show a map that's pretty much the only thing you can do you can show a map or show no map um but it is really cool it looks really good if you're using the built-in navigation for bmw it shows you that as well in the left-hand side of course you've just got the speedometer um and a lot of that is configurable one of the biggest things you'll notice is that a lot of these things are a little hard to find at first i was like you know what time is it what drive mode am i in things like that um but once once you stay in the car for a little bit you kind of get the hang of it so speaking of drive modes you've got four of them right here sport comfort ecopro and adaptive i pretty much stayed and adapted the whole time although this is definitely one of those annoying cars that will default you back to comfort so as you can see this car is definitely meant more for a luxury than for the sporty side if you want the sporty side you can opt for the new alpena xb7 which has almost twice the msrp but also almost twice the horsepower you've also got some you know standard equipment here with your parking sensors right there your camera which um this car actually does have the upgraded parking assistance package which adds the 360 camera which is really really nice um of course the rotary dial like i mentioned before and some quick buttons to get you to different parts of the infotainment which is quite nice and finally you've also got your adaptive suspension on the right hand side which is really nice you can change how high or how low you want your car to be you've got hill assist your parking brake and of course auto hold one of my favorite features in a lot of luxury cars these days this allows you to basically anytime you come to a full stop your car will just hold for you really really nice for long stop lights things like that where you really want to take your foot off the brake you've got some pretty good storage here this compartment's pretty deep you i got my sunglass container here got a receipt and a usb charger in here as well you'll notice there are a lot of usb chargers here the wireless charging is it works well but um it is kind of annoying that your phone becomes so far in there because you really it's kind of hard to reach later you've got some really nice wood trim here and you also have ambient lighting you can kind of see i chose a green i think there's like four different options maybe five uh orange green uh lilac which is really gorgeous and a few other ones um you can't really see it in the rest of this car right now but it does um go throughout the entire vehicle even in the third row seats you've got the nice wood trim continues all across the dashboard i really really like it it looks really nice uh very similar to the lincoln navigator which i drove recently as well and also um you know a lot of the competitors like the mercedes gls so the car i currently have does have the surround view 360 camera that only comes with the parking assistance package unfortunately though i would definitely recommend opting for that you can see it's got a really good resolution here and you can actually even activate the 3d view which is pretty cool take a look at that you can really see around the car which i feel like is super super cool um you can kind of move the way you want to view it but how cool is that and that's a very accurate picture of exactly where i am which is kind of crazy you've just got sensors all over the car and they show you pretty much every view you want one of my favorite features in this car actually is on the dorsal here you can see that little two right here that's lit up that actually allows the driver to control the front passenger seat how cool is that so you can move it up you know move the bolsters everything pretty much the exact same controls that the driver's seat has in addition i can actually move the rear seats as well using these really cool buttons which i also think is very very cool i love the idea of being able to do everything from the driver's seat definitely makes this a very good family suited vehicle the infotainment system in this car is pretty easy to use this is bmw's high drive i do feel like there are some things you could do to catch up to some of the really nice you know mercedes benz mbux platform and some of the other competitors but overall pretty easy to use i do have i like how all the settings are pretty much in this one settings menu you have all these different things here that go everything from your key button settings to um you know everything else um this is also a touch screen but i i've noticed that i really just like using the rotary dial one of my favorite things here is that there are different experience modes and when you when you click on them weird things happen in your car like basically the sunroof you know will basically close um different music will play um it's a very interesting thing i don't want to go through all of them right now but if you ever get the chance to rent this car or buy it i would highly recommend uh playing around with those you've also got some really interesting carrying car features here if you select one of these look three minute vitalize program that will invigorate the driver with the climate control lights and music um i did actually play around with that and it's actually pretty fun um but i i was kind of laughing too hard honestly you do have apple carplay and android auto both are standard on the 2020 model your android auto is actually just added for the year um so android users rejoice you can finally use that on this bmw x7 um the screen here is super responsive it looks really good it takes up the entire screen i love how it looks i pretty much use apple carplay the entire time it also does have wireless apple carplay which i think is really cool because then you can put it on the wireless charging tray and essentially still use carplay some closing thoughts on this car here one thing i just want to emphasize is just how good the inside looks how luxurious and elegant everything is in this car it really makes you feel like you are in a top quality flagship suv some of its competitors like the kia telluride the hyundai palisade in the uh non-luxury segment though are getting really close to the quality and i feel like bmw and mercedes especially with the gls they have to keep up their quality the lincoln navigator i feel like does feel more luxurious more luxurious than this but it is a lot larger however it is around the same price for the base model i love the door handles i love the door sills i love all of this it feels really really good the stitching is everywhere the dash looks great and i love how they didn't skimp out on the second row and third row they also feel and look really luxurious um i love the stitching and of course the heated seats are really really nice this card does come with heated armrests which is really interesting i don't really know how useful they are but they do feel good um this base model only comes with heated front seats and rear seats but it does not come with a ventilated seats unfortunately that you have to get in an additional package so driving the bmw x7 feels kind of like floating um i feel like any large suv feels very similar to this but with the adaptive air suspension on this car it really does make it feel like you're floating over those potholes wherever you're living um the 331 pound-feet of torque really do make this car feel quite torquey i feel like uh bmw quotes is zero to 60 and 5.8 and i feel like that's pretty pretty darn accurate um i'll try to rev it up here in a little bit i'll be getting on the freeway in a little bit so hopefully we'll be able to get a little bit of that power in but otherwise you never feel like this isn't powerful enough um if you do feel like it's not powerful enough you can upgrade some of the higher trims which definitely have all of that power that you'd want um but for now uh the turbocharged six cylinder is totally fine you can see here i'm at a stop the auto hold feature kicks in i'm not my foot isn't on the brake or anything like that and uh feels really good i think one of my favorite parts of this car as well is how when everything when you're at a stop everything is so quiet and i feel like you know no matter how loud the outside is you don't really hear much of that and that really enhances that feeling of luxury in this car all right so let's see if we can get some nice revs here we're getting on this big bridge so you can hear the engine i am going up a very steep hill right now though so definitely not the easiest thing there but of course there's a lot of power there um definitely didn't feel like you needed more power or anything like that and otherwise when you're just cruising it feels very serene in this car great family hauler i feel like i can't say that enough of course with the captain's chairs that only puts you at six people but even in this kind of like bad road very very quiet going 50 miles per hour right here and it really doesn't feel like it at all i found myself you know often going to speeds that you know we're definitely faster than i was expecting which i feel like is is going to be a common trend when you're driving a car like this so i kind of wanted to show what some freeway driving was like um i'm going pretty fast right here about 85 and it's so quiet right like you would never think that you're going this fast um that air suspension just it feels really really good the ride quality on this is fantastic um i guess the problem though is that all the competitors also have great ride quality right when you're in this segment everyone is using their best their best suspension right everyone has really really nice smooth rides and you kind of need a way to differentiate yourself here um but you know at least this isn't a negative bmw definitely did this correctly some other thoughts while i'm stuck here at a very long red light which i feel like is super common in the orlando florida area um i really hate how many features on this car are packages i do love these standard tech features they're really really good those digital displays are awesome but when you're paying about 80 thousand dollars for a car i would expect it to come standard with the surround view camera with a 360 camera but that is in a package um luckily you know you get blindfold monitors parking sensors all that stuff is standard which is really great but there are some features that i just feel like are missing and i really would appreciate here uh for example the stereo system is amazing this ten speaker system sounds really really good but i'm surprised it's not some sort of name brand one the harman kardonis upgraded sound system here um but in almost all the other luxury cars at this price point i feel like they come standard um the gls comes standard with the burmester sound system which is phenomenal um again not to discredit the sound system it's honestly one of the best i've driven especially considering it's not an upgraded one this sounds really really good but i do feel like there are certain things they're missing soft closed doors i feel like that should be a thing but that's included in a package a heads-up display also in a package unfortunately not the one i have here but yeah again this is a pretty base model um msrp is around 80 000 which is which is not terrible for this price point i feel like if you get a gls it's also going to you know tear you apart those packages it will easily put you in the six figures um but i would definitely recommend getting some packages like the premium package which includes the heads-up display and some other really nice features like the harman kardon sound system so definitely take a look at the packages and figure out what would be the best for you but i would highly recommend getting some of those packages because i feel like they really enhance the luxury features in this car and i feel like that's really what this car is all about
56;BMW;2021 BMW X7;2021 BMW X7 - Biggest Luxury SUV from BMW;[Music] today i'm behind it with a brand new 2021 bmw x7 and this is the biggest and most luxurious suv within bmw's very crowded suv lineup yes you have the x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 and soon x8 yes bmw has a very crowded suv lineup now in this video i'm going to go over the changes for 2021 and cover everything there is to know about this brand new x7 so you can decide if this full-size luxury suv from bmw is right for you all right let's get started now normally i'll be driving right now i would be driving this x7 around town and telling you about the drive and also be telling about the features and things that you would find on the inside and outside for this x7 but since there's so much to cover i'm gonna sit right here in the parking lot and i'm gonna go over those luxury features and features overall first then go for a drive now why don't we just start out with the outside the x7 since it is the biggest and most luxurious suv within bmw's lineup of course bmw had to give it the biggest kidney grills ever seen on a bmw those kidney girls up front are massive enormous if you think those kidney grills look big in videos or in pictures think again wait until you actually see them in person they are absolutely massive now besides the gigantic kidney grills you have some icon adaptive full led headlights on both sides they come with auto high beam and of course they do have very distinctive looking led daytime running lights also you get led fog lights with this x7 now everything put together right the front end is big bold very upright and it does look a little bit different than say the x5 or the x6 there's something about it that just looks bigger and bolder and yeah overall i like the front end now moving to the side that's how you can tell the x7 is enormous it just looks big it's very long it's very tall it's very wide and this is a good example of how big it is look at those wheels those wheels at first glance i thought they were 19-inch or 20-inch wheels no standard you get 21-inch wheels and they look okay they don't look too big they don't actually look very big on this x7 and that kind of shows you how big this x7 is on the outside now you do have a lot of satin aluminum trim on the side you know towards the bottom of the door which is nice and also window surrounds their aluminum sand aluminum and same thing look at the roof rails very beefy sand aluminum roof rails that you could actually use they're not just for design purposes they could actually be used which is really nice now moving on to the back of course you have the usual large privacy glass a spoiler shark antenna on top you do have some nice looking led tail lamps out back and you have dual chrome finishers out back too which is pretty nice and if you wanted to tow you could opt for the trailer hitch as you see here and the x7 could tow about six thousand pounds depending how you configure it anywhere from fifty four hundred pounds to six thousand pounds now moving out back you have a power liftgate of course now this design is a clamshell design just like the x5 so when you first open it it's only the upper half and you have to press a button to fold down the second half right now the good thing is if you want to close it you just press the button on top and they both close simultaneously the bad thing is they don't both open simultaneously there is one extra step now what's nice is from back here if you think the loading height is too high you can simply press a button and the x7 will lower for you because this x7 comes with adaptive air suspension yes you can lower the ride height in the back for easier access now behind the third row you have a good amount of room for groceries or small luggage and on the side you have a 12v outlet you have a net to hold things underneath you do have some hidden storage and on the left side you have a whole bunch of switches yes you have a lot of switches and a lot of controls everywhere inside this x7 there is a set of switches to fold down the second row set switches to fold down the third row and a set of switches to fold down both the second row and the third row or to lift up the second row and third row the good thing is everything is at your fingertips and everything is one touch you don't have to continuously hold it down all you have to do is tap it and away it goes now the bad thing is since everything is electronically controlled it's very slow very very slow once you press the button you gotta wait about five seconds for anything to even happen and then you probably have to wait about a full twenty or thirty seconds for it to complete whether to go down or up right so there's the good and bad to all these electronic switches and seats now moving to the second row if you do opt for the premium package you do get soft closing automatic doors which is really nice and in the second row you do have a whole bunch of switches there's a lot more switches in the second row than even in the third row so on the seat back on the very top there is a switch and this is what you use to fold down the second row if you wanted to now there's another switch on the side this is what you use to fold the second row forward or backwards to get into the third row and then there's a separate set of switches on the side and you use that to fold down or up the third row so as you can see there's a lot of switches and you just have to get used to which ones control what now once you're in the third row there's okay space for emergencies it's okay you can see i'm five feet ten my knees hit the seat back but second row passengers can move forward a little bit to give uh third row passengers a bit more room so that's nice you do get a pair of vents on top and if you have the cold weather package then you have a separate climate control just for the third row which is really nice now moving back to the second row you do have two pairs of vents also climate controls heated seats only if you opt for the cold weather package once again right but it's dual zone climate control and you have usb ports and a 12v outlet and again all the all the seat function is automatic so you can recline and slide and basically everything is automatic in the second row what's also nice is on the doors on both sides you do have switches for the sun shades the automatic sun shades if you do have the premium package also you have switches to control the dual sunroofs on top yes you can control the sunroofs even from the second row and i haven't seen that before that's pretty unique now moving on front very luxurious kind of looks like a x5 overall design shape everything except it's just a little bit bigger and there's a little bit more switches and a little bit more features just looking at the door panel you can see there's a good use of aluminum and leather but there's a whole bunch of switches and buttons so this button on the bottom here control the sun shade for the second row they will lift up or down both of them simultaneously right you have window locked you know automatic windows those are pretty usual then you have a button for the power folding mirrors okay then you have a switch for the power liftgate in the back right and then on the door you have your memory seats and then you have a switch and a button for the second row so if you wanted to uh move the second row forward so passengers could get in the third row you can use a switch and do that and if you wanted to only do it on one side there's a button that you press and then you use the switch right so a lot of switches for the the electronic seats in here everywhere there's switches and buttons right now moving the light control there's a whole bunch of things that you could do but basically i think you just leave it in auto and that's it and don't worry about it auto high beam right when the lights turn on everything is automatic and uh same thing with your fog lights steering wheel of course you have a leather wrapped steering wheel has a good thickness overall feels good and it looks good you do have a heated steering wheel on the bottom you have a whole bunch of switches on both sides to control volume phone you know scrolling muting your cruise control all that you do have paddle shifters in the back and also look at the live cockpit pro that's about a 12 inch digital gauge cluster very very nice the interface looks good and it's nice and bright you have your maps in the middle and on the right side you can scroll through a few things for example your g's or your radio station or you know what driving mode you're in your fuel economy stuff like that however i gotta say that this is a little bit more limiting than say the one inside audis which gives you multiple views and there's just more things to look at this live cockpit pro is kind of just limited in terms of what you see now moving to the infotainment system that is now running i drive seven this screen is just as big 12.3 inches and one of the new things for 2021 is filing the addition of android auto in addition to apple carplay so that is one big change now this touch screen is beautiful it's really beautiful it's very responsive very bright i love the interface you can figure out just messing around the menus pretty easy to figure out although there's a lot of things you can adjust from lights to audio to safety systems i mean there's a whole bunch of things that you can adjust now you could do everything with just your fingers with touch or you could use this idrive interface with a big scroll knob that you can scroll and point left and right press down there's a few quick navigating buttons that you can use in conjunction with this screen but if you didn't want to use that just simply use your hands and fingers and it works just the same now part of the premium package you do get something called gesture control which this screen will read your fingers now i'll admit i didn't take time to learn this whole thing i'm just trying to you know mess with it and just to do this with the volume it kind of works and it kind of doesn't so i don't know how useful that is i don't know how many people will actually remember all the gestures and try on and on and on right i think it's just easier to just touch or use the volume knob that's just my opinion now underneath the screen you have a button for your driver system features and inside this x7 you pretty much get it all emergency braking warning lane assist line spot monitoring rear cross traffic alert that's all included unfortunately the only thing not included is adaptive cruise control because that's part of a bigger package that adds on more advanced things like automatic uh lane changing so unfortunately adaptive cruise control is not standard underneath that you have a small little screen to control your climate control it's actually pretty bright it works pretty well you have a few buttons to control auto your fan speed your temperature right and then you have a row for other things like defroster options and so forth and you get heated seats if you opt for the cold weather package underneath that you have a row of presets these are kind of like favorites so you can program them to go to certain places uh that you use often you have a volume knob so underneath this cover you do have wireless charging and space for other things two cup holders and additional usb port now the shifter is just like all the other bmws they kind of work the same kind of don't you have to hold down the button and then you just press up to reverse back down right or going to manual and there is a button for parking now this x7 is equipped with parking a system package which automatically parks for you and it gives you the surround view with 3d view which is a 360 view of your x7 which is really nice so of course you get a view of what's behind you and everywhere around you and i love the animation when you're going from one side to another looks pretty nifty now around the shifter you have the start engine button and also drive mode so you can select sport and you can customize it so basically sport automatically changes everything to sport but if you wanted to just say adjust the steering or the throttle or suspension you can and then of course you have the comfort eco and you can adjust eco and eco pretty much adjust like the climate control and stuff like that and you have adaptive where the x7 will kind of predict your driving conditions and will adapt to your driving style so pretty cool now besides the auto hold brake and uh hill descent you do have a switch to control your height control so if you want to lower your x7 or raise it right you can but the x7 will automatically adjust depending on your driving speed on top you have homelink buttons under rear view mirror and controls for the dual sunroofs which you already get in the second row but again you get up here so of course you can open the big panoramic one up here and for the second row and you can open and close the little one for the third row passenger all right i'm finally behind the wheel so now let me talk about how this x7 feels on the road and how it drives first like most luxury suvs out there one of the things that you'll notice right away once you start driving is the seat belt retracts and it's the same with this x7 i know it's a little gimmicky but i fall for it every time i love it it just makes you feel like it's special another thing i noticed right away is when you're getting inside the x7 it's actually a little bit of a challenge this x7 is quite high so when it's in standard hype mode for some of you guys on the shorter side you may have difficulty getting in because this x7 does sit higher than the x5 and of course the x3 so that is something else i noticed right away when i was trying to get in but once you get in what i like is this commanding view right of course you can't adjust the height but the normal height you know i definitely feel like this is more like a full-size suv i'm sitting a little bit higher and overall commanding view and visibility is fantastic fantastic now visibility overall is great besides the elevated and commanding view because of the seating position but the windows everywhere is enormous enormous front windshield is big i can see well over the hood same thing on the side windows the door panels are nice and low so the windows are humongous same during the blind spot even though you have blind spot monitoring but blind spot is good and the rear visibility is also good i mean the rear tailgate window is nice and big so visibility overall is good driving position is also good now what's also good no i take that back what's fantastic is the suspension and the comfort of this drive right now it is so so soft it is unbelievably soft like you're you're sitting on a cloud i mean i thought the x5 suspension was good this x7 is a whole other level i mean literally you're you're not feeling anything you're just kind of floating over right now i'm in comfort mode i'm not in sport i'll test out sport a little bit but in comfort mode man is this smooth it's really really smooth and in a good way in a good way and uh those of you guys looking for a a really comfortable ride yeah you will get that in this x7 now besides a comfortable suspension the seats up here are pretty good too i mean they're a little bit on the harsher side a stiffer side i i kind of expected them to be a little bit more soft but overall isn't too bad the bolstering is good unfortunately you have to offer real leather yes real leather costs additional money which i think is silly uh for a luxury car especially with this price tag but yeah unfortunately you do but if you do offer leather it smells good the shape uh the design right the texture all feel pretty good but you know right now the seat back you know bolsters holding my back in the bottom cushion is okay although like i said i expected a little softer it's a little bit stiffer but you know overall isn't too bad and same thing with the second row and third row the second row felt just as good just as good and in terms of space i mean there's loads of it loads of it up front of course you can see plenty of headroom right shoulder room hip room i mean this is like a full-size suv so space should not be a problem so up front uh plenty big second row same thing if you have the second roll all the way pushed back i have almost like 12 inches of leg room so plenty plenty of space in the second row and you know what about the same in head room and a third row third row is not bad if you move up the second row a little bit yeah i mean there's good space for adults [Music] okay so just test out acceleration i had a little bit of a straight away now i was in comfort mode and i know i know if i go in sport mode it'll make a big difference but in comfort mode acceleration is uh is good you know doesn't feel too slow but didn't feel too lively either now because this is the base trim this is not like the m50i or the alpina one this one comes with the standard three liter turbocharged i6 made it to a eight speed automatic now this is the same engine that you find in the x5 and i loved it i loved it when i test drilled the x5 and it's really no different with this x7 right now driving around town this transmission is butter smooth i i can't even tell when it's shifting it's really really uh really really nice and you know acceleration is good there's not a whole lot of sound i don't hear much from the engine or exhaust it is very muted it's very quiet in here but now one big change for 2021 is that this engine is mated to now a 48 volt mild hybrid engine yes there's a mild hybrid engine now attached and it's supposed to help with the engine auto start stop functionality and help with other things that may need a quick jolt now what's strange is fuel economy actually went down on this x7 even with that attached so that's a little bit of a head scratcher so i'm not sure what the deal is with that now as for breaking i'm a little surprised though the pedal is a little mushy it does feel a little mushy which means that you know there's like a little give and you're gonna press down a little bit harder and because of the comfortable air suspension i do feel like their the body moves forward when you brake especially when you're braking hard right i didn't expect that i mean you usually get that with heavy big vehicles big trucks i did not expect that with x7 so the brakes i'll just say it's so so it's not as fantastic as the other things i've mentioned now i mentioned about how quiet it is in here it is really quiet it it's it's almost like ev car quiet it is very very well insulated in here no wind noise at all none nothing from the road right actually nothing from the road almost nothing from the engine unless you really accelerate and cars passing by i really don't hear it i mean it is dead quiet in here now as for steering i mentioned about this nice steering wheel ready it feels good but the steering feel right now is just so so there's actually quite a lot of steering play a lot more than i expected and the weight is okay but because of the steering play it makes me feel like the steering is a little vague i'm not too in control right but again this is comfort mode right and this will get adjusted in sport mode so next see my gesture control just popped up again uh that that's really really bothering me okay so next i'm gonna put this x7 in sport mode i'm just gonna leave it default where everything everything is turned on so let's see how it is now with sport mode i can tell the steering did get heavier i could tell that it's a little bit heavier so for those of you guys that enjoy the drive uh you'll enjoy this a little bit more unfortunately the precision didn't get any better there's still a lot of steering play so yeah it does improve upon it somewhat but not as much as i would have liked yeah the sport mode didn't didn't touch the brakes um i didn't expect it to but the brakes still feel a little a little mushy now what else changed for 2021 well there are some subtractions unfortunately so there was an off-road package which added a limited slip differential and also panels underneath in case you wanted to go off-roading unfortunately that was removed due to the pandemic also an entertainment package that was available that has also been removed also a trim level and an engine option was also removed the x-drive 50i that was removed so now if you want to go up to a v8 engine you have to go to the crazy m50i which is over 500 horsepower so yeah there was a lot of things actually removed for 2021 unfortunately now as for the suspension and sport mode i definitely do feel a difference it's a it's still comfortable but i do feel like yeah i feel a little bit more bumps um just going over pavement right so i could tell it did stiffen up actually i would say quite a bit versus comfort but it's still not uncomfortable the drive definitely feels different in this x7 versus say x5 at first glance you just think okay x7 is a stretched out x5 but once you drive it you realize it's really not it's actually a lot more than that it is bigger it's taller it's more comfortable it's quieter i mean everything about the x7 is just elevated so it is quite different when you're driving it [Music] oh yeah okay yeah like i like i expected sport mode made a huge difference with acceleration not only does the transmission hold the gear longer lets the rev gets up there right but also uh you can just tell there's a lot more boost and and this x7 feels a whole lot different when you're accelerating what's impressive is this engine is the base one and still you get a very powerful engine very lively drive most people would be satisfied with this powertrain but of course if you wanted more power you can get it you could opt for it so next up let me talk about the different trim levels and pricing and give you my final thoughts on this brand new bmw x7 as for trim levels the bmw x7 has three for 2021. the base is the xdrive40i and that starts under 75 000. 0-60 comes in around 5.8 seconds then you have the m50i which starts a tad under a hundred thousand dollars zero sixty drops to four point five seconds finally you have the alpina xb7 which is over a hundred and forty one thousand dollars and zero to sixty comes in in four seconds flat to conclude the 2021 bmw x7 is well deserving of its status and price tag the big luxury suv looks big and bold on the outside and provides plenty of space and cargo room on the inside everything on the inside is electronically controlled and the air suspension makes the ride feel like a cloud and also makes getting stuff in and out a breeze the x7 is extremely quiet provides a commanding view and has great acceleration the x7 can also be equipped with all the latest features one would be looking for the bad to the x7 include the mushy brakes that doesn't feel like it belongs the steering also has some play which doesn't get any better in sport mode there are a lot of packages removed for 2021 and the non-v8 option is now gone finally fuel economy gets slightly worse for 2021. overall i'm giving the 2021 bmw x7 a score of 104. to see where it ranks check out

57;BMW;2021 BMW X7;2021 BMW X7 | CAR MOM TOUR;[Music] hey guys it's kelly and today i am so excited to bring you a 2021 bmw x7 this is definitely one of my dream cars but i'm excited today to put it to the test with all things car seats and strollers this is your first time joining us hey i'm kelly and i'm the car room i review cars for moms and for families make sure you give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel because you're not going to want to miss any of the content i have coming up make sure to leave a comment below about which car i should tour next and let's get started [Music] okay so let's start with her exterior because she is so good looking first things is the front end get grill the signature kidney grill every bmw since the beginning of time basically has some variation of this kidney grill right here i love this one i love the high chrome all the way around it the beautiful bmw logo into this gorgeous huge white hood with some great nice lines we come around to some wrapping led headlights with some beautiful daytime running lights on right now more chrome down here i mean there's just something about a white bmw i think she is absolutely stunning lesbian to the side we have some blackout wheels which i think gives it a really nice contrast with this mineral white car and then we go into what can only be described as a chrome hockey stick just slapped on there but you know what i'm kind of here for it actually i love having a little mirror a little lip gloss checker we love to see that we've got some chrome roof rails a little bit of like a faux running board down here and it's just i think it's stunning comment below what you think of the exterior it's one of my favorite looking cars on the road i think she's so cute okay moving on to the back and we start with some wrap around tail lights right here a huge chrome bar that goes all the way across not my favorite look but it's okay x7 badging we have um dual square exhaust right here wiper kind of wish it was tucked underneath there but that's okay the one i'm doing today is the xdrive40i so it is a all-wheel drive six cylinder the x7 also comes in an eight cylinder stay tuned to the end of the video though because i'm actually going to be building my own x7 and i will talk you all through the different trim levels there overall exterior i think she's stunning i think she's beautiful and i think we're all gonna like the interior too okay so here's a shot of me in the driver's seat of this 2020 bmw x7 right from the get-go she is just screaming luxury we are doing a higher trim today a lot of nice packages added onto this one this one has an msrp of 86 thousand dollars that's expensive so let's see what we're getting for that much money if we start by looking at the door panel honestly it is a little basic i think that bmw really plays with that luxury and sport and i think they do it pretty nicely it's definitely not as luxurious looking as like a lexus or a mercedes it's a lot sportier kind of like the audis of the world i love it um so we've got some contrast stitching you know some nice chrome i like this little uh lock button in the chrome as well and then these chrome buttons i think is just all a nice detail side cubbies there look pretty good let's test it with a water bottle oh wow oh that's really nice okay i mean that that that's it for me that does a really good job okay so let's talk about some of my driver's comfort because the seats are a little bit firmer i think it just kind of depends what your personal preference is um they're pretty they're just firm it's a sport style seat if you guys can see i have bolsters coming out right here just to really hug me i do really like this part right here this is like an extra knee support so i'm really tall like about six feet tall so i like that i could move this thing in and out to give me a little bit more support right there so i think that's awesome overall comfort though is pretty good visibility visibility's decent visibility is pretty good you know this is a six or seven passenger car depending on if you get the bench or the captain's chairs it doesn't feel that big which is kind of exciting to me but let's see how i feel about the third row from this part right here i don't feel like i'm driving the three row car all right so let's start with some of the technology in this car we have got heads up display now it's not going to pick up on camera but heads up display displays how fast i'm going what the speed limit is who's calling me what radio station i'm listening to where my next navigation turn is whatever you want to have displayed it's right there it's not distracting and i think it's a huge safety feature because i can totally see who's calling me where i need to turn how fast i'm going without taking my eyes off the road so i love heads up display then i move beautifully into a full digital display i love digital displays i think they are gorgeous i think they provide a lot of customization absolutely obsessed this one's super cool because i can literally display my navigation so i can see where i am which i think is super fun then we move into this very nice completely touch screen very user friendly display and there is a ton of different things that you can do in this thing starting with just the basics like changing the radio station um your navigation your bluetooth and then the bmw just like gives you things that i don't think anyone asked for to be honest i'm not sure any person to ask for these features but here they are okay so the bmw comes with a bunch of different drive modes we've got our sports our comfort our economy but i did not know it came with what they call experience modes what's an experience mode well i'm still not entirely sure but all i know is that if i press like this well being button it puts my sun shades up it adjusts my air and it just says to immerse yourself in a relaxed atmosphere and enjoy some downtime okay um i can also go to expressive mode which opens things up back up now it's time to enjoy life and positive energy i think this is a very fancy way to do things automatically for you do i think i would hit a button when i'm feeling expressive to open up my sunroof no do i think if i wanted to open up my sunroof and put down my window shades all with one button i guess you could just do that the last one is executive you guessed it things are going back up it says use this cool calm atmosphere to focus your thoughts thanks x7 okay let's move down to some of the climate control and just like some of the more actual features we might actually use we have climate control right here we have all of our driver resistance features super easy to turn on and off if needed then this kills me all these buttons are so beautiful i mean we even talked about the 14 carat shifter that we're gonna get to they put these like weird little cheap plasticky buttons in here i just don't understand why they cheaped out right there not obsessed with that but we moved down i've got a wireless charger a little cubby space right here usb two cup holders love when the cup holders are like this because then there's no confusion about whose is which cup when the cup holders are like this i never know which one's mine so i think that looks great okay now we move into the crown jewel one of the most beautiful things i have ever seen in my life this shifter i mean if i could slap this thing and put it on my finger and wear it as a wedding ring i would it is absolutely stunning and they don't stop there this little track pad also completely iced out the stop start button iced out high gloss black exposed wood trim i mean this is like luxury central right here i think this is absolutely gorgeous obsessed with it moving into our center console she's a little tiny tiny actually was hoping this will be a little bit bigger she's a little tine tine there i do have an additional usbc so fun stuff um what else can we see oh my gosh this is the smallest mirror i've literally ever seen in my life i can't even see my whole face i can literally see this much in my face panoramic sunroof just absolutely gorgeous and it's in the second row and then the third row has its own little mini sunroof which is darling you can control everything from here which is awesome you can even control um the sun shades so you can put the sunshades up and down too which i think is awesome for like having little kiddos back there obsessed with that all right here is a shot of me in the second row of this bmw x7 so much nice space back here actually so i have this seat set for myself at six feet tall great knee clearance now like i said earlier the bmw x7 comes in a bench or captions chairs i'm doing the captain's chairs today the bench has nothing to write home about though it's it's a very narrow bench it's not very popular in this model the captain's chairs are a lot better i would recommend thinking about this car as a six passenger car really is a very comfortable four passenger car but as far as my second row is concerned super comfortable check out these side cubbies i'm talking deep little trouble with oh there there she goes nice nice nice love the side cubby okay so interesting i have all the control right here i can do whatever i want i can open the third row sun shade i can control this sun shade i can control this sun shade and i can even close this thing if i want to it's kind of like a lot of control for some passenger drivers i'm sure you can lock it next thing that's a little funny is here's my vents here and here not on the ceiling third row on the ceiling i prefer ceiling events if you have rear-facing kids like myself because i think they get kind of hot in the summer but with these vents on the side i do think it would probably provide some pretty good circulation so that looks nice we've got two more cupholders right here with two usbc's in my own climate control as well as heated seats in this trim level i'm pretty comfy i mean it's very luxurious i'm feeling very luxurious can't wait to put a car seat in it though okay so let's chat about the car seat set up a little bit so today i brought my graco extended fit i put it rear facing this captain's chairs to give you an idea of space good spacing kind of as i was expecting now the interesting thing is that actually every single seat back here has its own set of tether anchors and lower anchors so it's actually really surprised to see that i will try to install a car seat in the third row in a second if you're considering this car i highly suggest that you consult a certified child passenger safety technician just to make sure that your specific car seat setup will work for this car i'm just trying to give you an idea of the space okay i just want to talk about kind of like the functionality of this car from a mom's perspective because the x7 is not it if you're gonna have to have car seats up here and then still utilize that third row there's no car seat friendly tilt this aisle is borderline non-existent so even if you have kids in booster seats because there's no way you can't go through the aisle right here you can't hold the seat down and access it with the car seat it would be very difficult to use that third row so just something to consider if you're looking at this car um let me hop in the third arno i'm also not going to lie to you these seats are kind of driving me absolutely crazy because they're like they're trying to help too much quite frankly so you're like okay is that how i do it now this seat moves up and then you have to just sit here and wait okay so here i am in the third row of the bmw x7 a little stressed i'm not gonna lie because there's so many buttons and then nothing's labeled correctly i'm gonna get to all that in a second let's just talk about my amenities so i love my own little private sunroof that's absolutely darling i think i'm looking so cute i have heated seats back here too so how about that huge seats in the third row my own climate control vents are on the ceiling which is awesome i've got a usb c back here and i have the tiniest coupler nothing fits there nothing fits there okay let's talk about how to get these seats back because i'm honestly not even 100 sure okay yeah why oh my gosh why would everyone put my own seat back okay i guess you could put the third row down from right there okay hot dog i don't know how to bring this back oh okay now it's doing it oh my gosh this is absolutely terrifying okay i'm back here and i'm gonna have a good attitude about it um i'm back here my knee clearance is pretty good now we have this seat all the way back and my knees still aren't touching so that's pretty exciting the seats back here are actually pretty wide like as you can see i like that they're just trying to make this a two-seater bat here not a three seater because i'm actually pretty comfortable i've got really good head clearance for a third row so i'm i'm happy i just cannot believe how like long every seat takes to move and like this is just a scenario i just wish it wasn't power i wish i could just do it myself because i feel like that would just be so much easier so i don't know a guy cute little window here i'm pretty comfy i would call it a love hate okay after a little um hard work i was able to install this gray hooks and the fit forward-facing in the third row i the headrests are not removable back here but i was able to securely put my tether strap through and it's not affecting the headrest because it's not like bulging out too much i'm moving less than an inch at the belt path so overall feeling pretty good about this installation again try it out with your own car seats let's talk about this trunk love this i already love this you know what this is it's called a watermelon catcher it's called you go to costco you live on a hill you open your trunk up nothing flies out love this to open this part you just hit this completely power and then i love that it gives you a nice little like trunk extender it's also a good like hoist and slide situation really like to see this um we've got a pretty little deep like side compartment down here which is kind of cute come with run flat tires so no spare tire i don't think my shoulder's gonna fit but let's try oh i stand correct well let's see okay i was not expecting that that's freaking exciting okay so what i like about back here is even though it's all power and takes 756 56 years you can control everything from back here so i can put these seats down nice do the other one oh gosh okay it's like things start moving and i don't know what to expect but anyway good sized trunk with the third row down we're just driving around guys in the bmw x7 let me just tell you something it's like driving on glass it is so smooth it accelerates so nicely it handles beautifully do not i feel like i'm driving a sports car and i'm driving a big suv absolutely love the drive i love the drive of bmws is the car the most functional for car seats no do i think it would be no do i feel like a badass a hundred percent yes i do would i buy this car no would i buy this car if i could afford three yes i love it i mean it's it's to me it's a dream car status it's not functional with me and my current kids in their car seat situation if they were older i knew you put it on my list but i mean i would drive it with no kids i just absolutely love it so thank you so much for watching special shout out to bmw of west st louis here in st louis for lending me the car for the morning if you want to lend me lend it to me for longer next time i would not say no to that make sure you subscribe to my channel give this video a thumbs up and turn on the bell icon because i'm telling you guys i've got content coming and it's going to be good okay bye all right y'all let's build this 2021 bmw x7 so there's two options here i can get the x7 x drive 40i which is the 3.0 liter um turbo twin power turbo inline six cylinder or i can get up to the m 50 i which is a 4.4 liter v8 look at that price jump though this one would drive i mean it would be amazing but i'm not going to do that i'm going to go here if i can keep this under 90 i feel like i'm winning so now you get into the different like look so you can either do this luxury which obviously has like a lot of nice chrome detailing or you can go up to the m sport i mean that looks so much better look at the difference so i'm gonna go for the m sport because i just really feel like i need that next we go to exterior bmw has some beautiful and i mean beautiful colors a lot actually included in the m sport package so you guys know i love a blue car oh my gosh that's basically carmon blue very tempted to do that let's look at like this gray i mean that looks awesome i also like this carbon black metallic which is kind of like a dark navy oh my gosh how do i even choose what's this one this one's an additional am i gonna do this am i gonna be that out there no i'm not i'm gonna go for the carbon black metallic i know you guys were all so invested okay then moving to the interior lots of fun options um we've got the black we've got a coffee which is like a chocolate brown but i think this cognac is beautiful it's like the per it's not too orange and then when i get into my different package options i can choose between the premium and the executive so i really like it because bmw has really simplified it i do definitely want the heads-up display because like i'm in a bmw i feel like i just need that um and then i want the rear electric sun shades so i'm going to go for the premium i'm not going to go up to the executive so i'm just gonna select that okay so that brings my 2021 bmw x7 to an msrp of 81 150 which is very expensive but oh my gosh look how cute love it
58;BMW;2021 BMW X7;2021 BMW X7 | Review & Road Test;are you looking to buy a fancy three row suv how fortuitous you clicked on this video this is the bmw x7 it's the largest vehicle bmw makes consequently there is ample room for adults in all three rows at least assuming you're an average sized human like me i am five foot ten let's make our way through all of the rows in the front seat i can get into a very comfortable and commanding position yeah that's nice moving to the second row by the way actually before we move to the second row check this out up here on the b pillar it says x7 stamped into the sheet metal that's kind of a nice little easter egg moving to the second row the x7 has power second row seats that you can slide forward and you can recline which is nice that's actually pretty comfortable recline there also point out that there's a three seat bench or second row captain's chairs so that gives you either seven or six passenger max depending on which one you go with in fact let me move over here so you can get a better sense of how i fit head room is excellent i could probably move this front seat forward a little bit and have a little bit more knee space but i fit fine here i'm going to show you something maybe a little dismaying i'm pushing the button to get into the third row let's see how long it takes front seat's moving forward this thing's motoring that direction i'm aging before your eyes grizzled wrinkled i crawl into the third row okay again i could probably ask whoever's here to move forward a little bit so my knees aren't squeezed into the seat back um but assuming they're willing to give you a little bit more knee space this is comfortable um this the height between my feet and my butt is decent so i feel like i'm in a good position and the headroom here is great and i'll also point out that the armrests and the cup rollers this is all soft and like stitched and there's real wood trim back here this is a pretty luxurious place for third row passengers normally this is all filled with plastic in lesser three row mid-size suvs but this is i would say luxurious okay the x7 can haul people what about cargo behind the third row you've got a cozy little nook for cargo though you can expand that if you want pushing these buttons right here eventually the third row will motor forward and you'll have 48.6 cubic feet of space it takes a little bit of patience but eventually it gets there one thing i really do like about the cargo area though is the split hatch so the lower part lowers down and it gives you a place to sit to observe your children when they're playing a sport you can scream at them from here and then if you flip it up if you have canned items back here you'll never sacrifice a can of baked beans to the god of your driveway again and then you can close this right up that's a pretty neat hatch elsewhere the cabin indulges with fine materials and the technological trappings of luxury living ooh leather real wood trim and look an idrive 7 infotainment system you can control with this control knob or directly via the touchscreen the 12.3 inch display looks great though the menu structure might take a little adaptation to get used to but if you don't want to mess with any of that you can also use your voice using bmw's personal assistance technology hey bmw i'm tired hi what can i help you with i'm tired pardon i'm tired date and time please continue using manual control here killer voice recognition your voice may vary a few minutes later hey we got the vitality program running i said i'm tired and beyond bmw like turned on the discotheque music you don't need to go to the club you got an x7 it's blowing wind on me and showing me a forest generic beats yeah well we've all embarrassed ourselves enough i feel revitalized moving on to powertrains the base x-drive 40i we're driving features a three-liter turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine with a mild hybrid system that enables inoffensive automatic engine start stop functionality when the vehicle is motionless there's also a more powerful 4.4 liter twin turbocharged v8 in the m50i that is unsurprisingly less efficient what is surprising is that when it's tuned for use in the alpena xb7 the 4.4 liter v8 has the exact same fuel economy rating despite an obscene jump in power weird all x7 models include all-wheel drive a fine-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission and a 7 500 pound tow rating regardless of engine i'm driving the weakest version but flat foot acceleration feels plenty eager brakes feel good too that eager spirit when accelerating is also reflected in the x7's handling mass has implications but even so the x7 steers like a bmw albeit a heavy bmw a motivated driver can tackle corners with commendable speed for maximum fun use sport mode to firm the standard adaptive air suspension and lower the x7's ride height you can also use the adjustable ride height to impress your neighbors assuming they find this impressive our tester also includes the dynamic handling package whose m-sport brakes and active steering further elevate the seven's sporting prowess at a more relaxed pace ride quality is outstanding wind and road imperfections are definitely obscured gifting occupants a serene cocoon in which to contemplate existence and its purpose or lack thereof whoops got a little existential there better floor to distract my brain and now let's talk price for the kingly sum of 75 grand not including destination charges you can buy a base bmw x7 x drive 40i generously outfitted with 16 way heated front seats heated armrests quad zone climate control a power tailgate apple carplay and android auto smartphone integration and a robust array of active driver assist technology including lane departure warning active blind spot detection and forward collision alert and unlike some fly-by-night car companies bmw specifically notes that refrigerant is standard if you've ever had to supply your own refrigerant when buying a new car be sure to tell us in the comments among the countless optional features are heated and cooled cup holders ventilated massaging front seats soft closed doors and a huge panoramic roof spring for the driver assistance pro package and the x7 can manage the steering braking and accelerator all by itself with vigilant human oversight of course how does the system work in the real world actually pretty well i haven't hit anything yet adorned with the cold weather dynamic handling luxury seating and executive packages our xdrive40i test vehicle lands at ninety six thousand dollars choose the more powerful x7m50i and the starting price is one hundred and one thousand dollars before options and if you go with the most elite alpena xb7 you're gonna need at least 143 grand of course we can't leave without mentioning bmw's gesture controls if pushing a button or turning a knob seems too dignified try gesture controls i'm making it louder i'm going ahead of track or at least attempting to i'm turning it down oh that's so much better than twisting a knob before flinging major league coin at your nearest bmw dealer you might also investigate competitors like the comparably pricey mercedes-benz gls class or the notably cheaper audi q7 volvo xc90 or lincoln aviator alternatively the x7 smaller x5 kin is cheaper and offers third row seating but only if you view third row seats as an occasional use feature lastly if you want superior people hauling abilities with literally tens of thousands of dollars still in your pocket something like the kia telluride sx prestige package could make sense but if you demand a family wagon marked by engaging driving dynamics legit luxury and a price tag to match the bmw x7 could be a good fit [Music] you
59;BMW;2021 BMW X7;2021 BMW X7 xDrive40i: The Epitome of Luxury and Generous Space;hey everybody welcome back to the channel so I'm apologized in advance especially if you're a first-time viewer you're going to think what's wrong with audio um I actually flew in um I'm out of town for got my microphone unfortunately so when we're reviewing this the best way I can with the GoPro mic so hopefully that it um all right but this is a 2021 BW X7 um it has this is the x-drive 40i um it's got the M sport package you can see which M sport gives it that more of a sportier look um you lose a lot of that the aluminum Trim in place of now you get the black accents I think the M sport is the way to go and like you know I said it either one is fine but I think this is just looks the most aggressive in this um The Styling here I would say this is a more pronounced rope presence especially when you look at it from this view it just it just really just sort of has a commanding look even when you drive it it gives you that that dominant uh feel has a um is a little bit masculine but I can see definitely being you know a car for you know all types First Impressions when I first jumped into it it is truly the seven series of SUVs it is massive I mean look how long that rear door is it is it is huge um you do have these 22 inch wheels and it has the M Sport brake calipers they're in Black you can order them in blue and I think red not too sure about the red but no blue you can get them in that color as well the cool thing about the X7 is it comes with a two axle air suspension standard so right now it's sitting in its normal height you do have another setting that's lower for sport mode you do have another setting for which is your sort of think of like your um entry and exit mode is if you have someone like for example my wife is short the lower mode help her getting it out of the car loading things in and out of car will help and just like typical BMW X5 fashion they also give you the split tailgate so let's see that now so we're going to open the tailgate actually I need the key with me let's get that obviously you get your BW key with the M sport you get the M Tri colors on here um lock and there's fold you can unlock get your panic button attach and of course like I said that's not touch sensitive then of course too you can do a remote start I don't know if it's even aggravated on this one but you can do remote start by pressing just three times in a row and also if you uh have the app you can remote start by activating the climate setting let me open the hatch with M sport you get the black exhaust tips this one does have a towing package was an option you get a I want to say this is a class three hitch from your class B Class 4 can't tell um really can't tell with these things but if we order it with the hitch um it's a two inch receiver um you have your two ports you got your four pin and your seven-way harness so that's something that um be nice to have looks like someone nicked that right there um but yeah you do have those options as well obviously parking sensors we can go in here all right so you get the option to have the suspension deflate itself and lower itself to the slowest level um so hit this now go ahead and drop itself to the lowest setting all right then I could open the tailgate power tailgate had it too it's nice for you to sit on it things like that all right so you see here I got the stroller back here I'm gonna set that off to the slide for now and then this umbrella all right so it's got a Max setting so hit this it's going to drop all the seats down you can see the front seat moves up as it pulls the seats down you see it I just press and hold that I gotta press hold it the whole time and it moves all the seats flat all this conquer room I'm gonna put that into the description how much card room there is a lot they don't go completely flat but there it goes good enough to load something in here definitely a 65 inch TV to fit back here just fine can I bring them back up power there's Max cargo now it's the max position for this part yes I can bring up both there the second row and the third row up and keep holding it and you can see it's like that third row come up and as a position to seats it moves the front seats out the way so the headrests don't bump into the front seats so now if I just want to drop the second the third row hit these two I think if I close this one I closed the token individually you're supposed to hatch if I close the hatch to tailgate will shut itself all right possibilities in this is endless this is one large check-in suitcase this is a medium check-in suitcase gonna have a stroller up here if for example I wouldn't need to use a third row the third row would be up and these two suitcases should fit you know what actually they won't fit because the third row is going to be right here this line so maybe one of the large suitcases turned up on the side or maybe a couple of these but uh yeah a lot of room in here you can do it I think with the third row you're gonna be limited almost like most SUVs even something of this size um you still only you're a company from here to here as far as space wise so here we are with the you know I'm assuming the third row be up you have this but again um limited as far as cargo room but then you also have option if you're gonna do that good rooftop box mount it go from there because really I don't really there's not many SUVs out there who can offer a lot of different space unless we get to like the extended little base Escalade or um Yukon XL or something like that where it's going to have that extra extra room even when you get the third row up 91 octane is recommended 89 is uh minimum you can put in here here it is all season place and the cargo room let's see what's back here oh there's a cargo cover right there so you get the smart key access you lock the car from here both doors have it and then when you grab the inside of the door handle it unlocks soft closed doors same thing here soft close the clock and not gonna unlock so if I need to put the kids in first guess what I can grab this door handle open this door all right so I'm gonna start the backseat first let's look at this you got two options you can do your typical does it one two oh I guess you can see it's in the back but I'm I'm guessing it's a seven seater probably yeah it's a seven seater you got the two in the back that that three so tune it back and you have you can do an option where you can captain seats where you can do just make it a six-seater um if I were to do this I'd probably expect as a six seater you have your door control so here you can do the sun shade so the rear passenger can control the sun shade here for the sunroof they also can control their um sunshade for the window so actually I think this is opens the sunroof I just check this out let me get the back seat later on in the video oh there you go I just hit this button button lowered that sunshade this one raised that size shade all right so it's like privacy Shades here it's cool and also these can be activated from the front driver area as well so this must be percent of what your car is not on um you do have power seats in the rear like I said this is your discover series of SUVs so I would not expect anything less than this I can't running boards step in if you need to and you have eliminated um m logos for the door seal now if someone jump in the back seat for example you got this button here which would then takes a second it puts the front seat up first the process but it happens don't worry be patient then the rear seat passenger can climb in pull the seat up and it's all done electronically there you go so I'm gonna jump in here and I'm gonna turn the car on before I completely do that they're real all right okay now if I'm a third row passenger I jumped into the beer what's next here how do I get the seat back I guess this I'm just did my first time it's your laying with me I'm looking around I don't see anything let me hit that button again on the side at the seat which will be here let me hit the back one and here comes the seat I just hope it doesn't crush me back here but here it comes okay oh five foot agent eight inches all right and this is me sitting back here um I could do maybe a couple hours a couple hours max for me I just I feel a little bit claustrophobic in a sense because this seat is so high up for me um here back in here and I'm just sitting here like okay I have a window okay a cup holders here um I do have a sun roof here and let's check this out so you see my niece they're not touching the seat is back not back that far it stopped at a decent location you can see here in the front room that there's room and I'm gonna jump in the front this second row so you can see how much room there is um but I do have a sunroof there's a glass I don't know if it's open it's probably not but uh yeah you have your own climb control I have my own heated seat back here so each person in here has his own outboard heated seat um honestly it is so that would say this is a five Zone climb control back in this total car over here you have a light reading light and if I want if this shade is too much it's like I could shut it just like that there you go so that will have I mean I can tell it cool down just from that shade it's hot outside it's this here is looks like a tie down and USBC port so cargo tied on USB super Port back here so I had to have bubbles if you know you have a smaller child or you know small teen or something like that I think they'll be fine with this cup holder tablet or something like that I don't know I guess I don't know how you do in a longer trip like this because there is a little bit of that classroom but I think that's from any SUV with their row uh let me know what you think in the comments um there is an air vent open nose um so there's airflow like I said then you you can do that which gives it more of a spacious look in here all right so to get out I'm gonna do the same thing I'm gonna press this oh you gotta be kidding me there it goes I thought I was stuck in here for a second like I'm gonna open the door and get out all right okay door handle and now I'm here running board does help because it's a nice little step to get down so I'm not just stepping directly on the ground so I have that um do it from from this angle coming out of that rear third row you do need to be some of a um yoga does a bit of a stretch so I think it's the one that's uh have mobility issues maybe I wouldn't want to put them back here okay wait for this process to happen again Okay jump into the second row all right okay right away tell you something this pillow right here it feels nice man it feels nice and let me see if I can now I'm sitting where it was in the third row where I had sitting lapse position but let's see what it looks like here and this position here and I have plenty of leg room I have a USB C4 I'll say there's a place to attach devices um obviously the road window down raise it up but let's see what this does okay so that can control the sunshade here in the pendant what the driver does so the driver I don't know if they can override that I have to check the settings and see but the rear passenger can shut that if they want and of course you can stop it anywhere you want it so I can say you know I want to stop it right there and that that'd be good halfway point maybe the driver says okay yo agree we can share it you know you can close your side or whatnot or maybe you have a child in the back and the sun's declaring and you want to still have something so I can shut that here and then I think this button I wonder if it opens the center let's try it out no okay so this button controls the third row interesting okay so here in a second row no exceptions here you got obviously usb-c Port here two usb-c ports here 12 volt out lit socket right there a little pocket and here you got two um individual climate controls so then also individual heated seats so each app or passenger can get its own heated seats air vent here okay one air vent back here all right nothing on top you have reading light and in a dome light so once the Dome ones are reading look how much space from here look at the driver's seat his head rest is up but look how much space there is for someone that's tall it has to drive this they would have no issues drive this all right now let's see how much legroom I can say like there's nobody in the third row and I want to stretch out so let's pull this back it's power operate it I'm gonna go this back as far as I can okay as far as it goes I want to recline as far as it reclines this would be something that I could definitely yeah let me see if I get an armrest there you go this is nice now for a road trip yes this this this would be comfortable I mean look how I mean I have all this room my feet are stretched out because then I'm getting a five foot eight um I mean I would like to see a little bit more recline um but this is obviously not the captain's seats I wonder if the cap seats does more but this one would be man this would be something that you know as a you know younger my parents had something like this this would be nice something to have you know um I think there is a way to get some entertainment I think from this view I would like a screen I think this I believe it is an option you can do your entertainment I know BMW is going away for that for the newer cars because they're seeing it as something that people don't order very much obviously with things of having tablets and smartphones um I can see why that's not a thing but I wish BW was still offer it for those who want it um two cup holders back here and then the words right here not touching car seats easy access to the latch and obviously a car seat I mean there'd be no room there'd be no reason why a car seat could fit back here all right coming out of this one all right so here I'm gonna show you a couple things here you have obviously the sun shades for the rear um it's hitting this raising lures both sides of the sun shades uh power windows power mirrors these are power 40 mirrors as well these mirrors also have blind spot monitor there nothing that you expect for cars caliber um power open hatch tailgate area you see this number two this number two for example say for example I need to move this passenger seat up estimate reaching all the way across I can just activate this then use my own stick control on my side and I can raise with the seat forward and back and you probably ask why is that handy what if I need to put something back there what if I'm in the driver someone drop us in the back and or the kids are getting something I'll say hey I'll put a seat out don't worry you know like I'm going to see that about the way um also your memory seats so I can even set a memory on this side to all this signature preset and then I like to do that pressure for a car seat of some type so I said okay this is the first that goes back I know this is my setting I think it's stress number two in this in that setting all right for rear you can do rear controls so if you're gonna let people in the back seat I can do um I can press this and I can say for example I want the left seat to control press and hold this and actually I put the left seat in so down my seat actually my driver's seat just went up a little bit and what that did is just um lets the person in the rear jump into the back okay now it moved my seat up I guess you gotta be respecting that but if I need to come back down just press this back and it will retract and then your driver's seat should come back on his own there are different options obviously you have your light control this is a fully automatic headlight which means when I saw about foot automatic the headlights will activate automatically Dusk and Dawn when it's raining outside when wipers are on are low or automatic setting detects enough rain it will activate the headlights for you the parking lights here you have Roadside marking here uh headlight activation right there and then fog light right there all right off and then back to auto all right each time you turn the light on it gives you an indication lights for dare tells you to parking and the headlight is on if I just go to parking or if I go to fully headlight if I go to fog light you'll see a fog light with that side of the indicator tells you what the 12 days are on okay Drive nice automatic um cruise control you can set your cruise here activate the cruise mode and then you can set your speed and then adjust your speed if you have the driver assistance package then you can do adaptive and you'll have adaptive setting limiter means that I don't want to cruise control but just limit me for my speed so I can say okay I can set it to 80 and in that point I can drive freely and then when I hit 80 feels like the car hits a governor in a sense now if I if I'm at 80 miles an hour and 50 or if I say like I said that 70. it's like that you know 70's gonna speed but also I need to pass on one well that limiter won't limit you and say okay you can't pass it will let you override it if you put the pedal down to the floor it will let you go beyond it because that's telling you maybe you're in danger maybe you need to get around something quickly um it allow you to go beyond but most of the time limited is going to limit your speed so that way you don't feel so controlled where you can adjust it below the control but also make sure you don't have a heavy foot and this car is probably something you wanted in give you examples coming from the airport with this card and we'll come back from um from Raleigh and I was heading back you know um to my destination and I just looked down and I was doing 90 miles an hour and I didn't realize that my wife didn't realize it and I think I was just keep it just kind of going to flow you know in front of me and I didn't realize just just the car just is super quiet it's really smooth and it's something that I don't it's just something that it takes a minute to get used to so if you don't know the car it's easy just kind of slow creep up that stuff there um you got a heated steering wheel um you have heated seats here for driver passenger there's also a ventilated seat option and we do heated seats you can turn a heated armrest so just arm rests are also heated okay obviously defroster controls air conditioning controls driver assistance controls you can do individual you can see until you can individualize so I can say okay what do I want that's on like departure warning for Collision warning you know I have those things that are on um I could configure it and eventually I could have everything all on okay um you can go your menu controls for your air conditioning you can choose the air quality automatic recirculation so into the text um harmful fumes smog things like that it'll agree circulation once the air cleans up it will go to fresh air if it's really hot outside for example the car is real hot inside so your carpet sit outside all day it will obviously recirculate it first and then once the air cools down outside it will go back to automatic and it does that without you knowing so it's all working in the background Heating and ventilation you can do obviously control obviously the seats um and then let's see here you can set different rules so what I say rules means let's say for example it is like I said below anytime that's below 40 40 degrees when I get into the car first thing turn on heated seat turn on heated wheel right for example like that or if you have a late seat option when it's above above a certain temperature I won't activate the ventilated seat and you can set that up any way you want it you can have it on or off certain temperatures anything between and that's just so you have to get into and always have to press here to see you know it's automatically on and once the car warms up it turns itself off there are different functions in here especially your color to size um it could park itself automatically so you have automated parking um 360 camera which is nice you can turn the wheel this way you know you got the guidance lines guidance markers which helps um you got your backup assistant Backup Assistant you wonder what that is that it traces your path automatically when I so for just for example um we have it on X3 I pulled into the garage I pulled hurt my wife's car to garage that's actually it's hers when I pulled the car into the garage I like to pull in close so I can open the doors or both sides she looked at it and she's like how I'm gonna get that thing out of there because you pulled so close to the wall the mirror you know she's worried about having hitting the mirror and things like that and I said don't worry I said use your backup assistant because if I didn't hit the mirror coming in it won't hit the mirror coming out it's going to pull the exact same path that I pulled in so let's try it out and to turn that on the the steering wheel to control and it steered itself and it fault the exact path of getting out of the garage without um hit anything as long as like I said if a car parked behind me I'm saying hit that but it was perfect for her to get in and out of the garage especially when if I parked it too close to the wall and so she had to do some maneuvering to get it out it just back that stuff out to where that path you still control the brake and accelerator pedal but you if the steering is automatically controlled and you can see here it tells you how far the doors at their Max opening where the where they're gonna hit so for example here it's going to open just beyond that white line so if open the door should be just beyond that white line which is exactly where it's telling me right um obviously get their camera views and then you have augmented reality so you can see the of course you put automatic it'll tell you if you come down here you got your different modes sport mode now sport mode drop suspension you can see it here that light that second light is coming on just let me know the suspension is dropping to the next level uh Eco Pro adaptive function which means it just sort of predicts your driving style it just sort of based on how you drive it's going to adjust it um automatic hold so now we break that on when you stop it automatically turns on the automatic holds the brake pedal for you so think of it this way if you're in a drive through or some type you don't have to sit there and rest your phone to break the whole time you can begin drive so I'm gonna drive and I'll hit my foot off the brake and it will not create it'll sit there bright lights be activated it'll hold itself and then for me to release it I just have to accelerate pedal and you'll see it release especially here in the car we'll start the movies now I'll say I can't move because I'm in front of me but just give you example anytime you want it you can just go also anytime you see the park mode with the auto hold on it turns on the parking brake you got healed the second troll heel descent controls if you're going down a steep hill um you want to control that speed instead of riding a brake you can just hit that on and think of a cruiser troll to not let the car roll too fast so I'm not saying we're off-road but if you were going on a off-road or a grassy Hill it will control the speed it'll control the ABS make sure you don't do anything there um or if you're just like I said if I'm descending out of a steep parking garage or some type of Hill you can set the speed and it'll automatic controller for you um you do have a wireless phone charger here um and then you have 12 volt Outlet which is being occupied by radar detected right now and then you have a USBC USB a port actually a cup holder heated and cold cup holders are available in this car and then let's see I think that's pretty much it for here this is something new for me is through the air suspension so this these lights are here tell the air suspension this is sort of your lower height this is only available when you're stopped helps when you're getting in and out of the car so if I were to let's say for example let's say for example I um in the lowest setting right now let's get out the car and take a look how it looks in here and right now I can see because I'm stepping out and it's lower to the ground look how that looks nice you can drive like that huh it goes to a lower setting when you're in a sport mode but not that long this is a sport getting in and out so let's do a quick walk around let's go to um the highest setting the door's gonna be closed where to happen so as I do it you'll tell me also so let's go up to and you'll see it here let's go to the next one it's pretty fast too I had this on my Audi Q7 which was nice so let's um I'm in the highest setting this mode these these two high modes are available only for at lower speeds so now my foot barely reaches getting out of here not as tall as I thought I was expecting but I guess I needed to clear an obstacle or some type I could I need to run over this parking block I could see who got the active drill starters so they're open right now they're taking more air so yeah that definitely could uh help there I'm gonna go back to comfort mode I'm gonna see where that that position is I'm gonna see if I'm watching from outside as well okay I'm gonna shut the door let's see if it drops there it goes that's regular normal riding height all right if I go to sport mode support mode isn't going lower it does lower itself support most low enough yeah that's pretty cool so this is that sport mode right there all right so let's do a quick walk around I'll show you the lights all the lights I'm gonna do this fast because it's about to rain all right so these are headlights put the fog lights on at night time there's no mistaking that this is definitely BMW that has the LED light there's a laser light that's an option and then the tail lights now the tail lights are gonna be always on unless you turn off the Daytona lights yeah it still has that mean stance from the back X5 like stance I always like the x5s have that that aggressive look there's no exception here all right let's turn on the hazard lights indicators in the mirror as well foreign roadside lights are helpful when you're parking on the street um you can turn on the parking lights on one side of the other side of the car so example if I'm parked on the the right side of the street here um I can turn on the right the left side lights and then when I got the car the only so you see here we're parked look at the left side the roadside lights on you can see here that only the left side is on there at a reduced rate it saves battery um and that's just so the car stays visible at night if I go back here back side you should only see the tail lights on the left side maybe hard to see in the daylight but you can see there the I can see that is on the left side tail light is on and then the right side is off okay I'm gonna turn off the car you'll see these real shutters close and they're shut all right that will change open and close depending on the needs especially when it's on the highway if unless it takes enough air it's going to shut itself for more aerodynamic needs if you're stopped like I said for example this parking lot is opening something to sucking more air to the fans all right so let's move back here to the rear all right so come up top you have your um if you have your um garage controls you have your sunshade here you can get it close so sunshade I think this is for the rear yeah so when I close the rear and then you have one that closes the main you can open a sunroof you can hit this tilt it up or you can slide it back for a penny Center if I wish it this is a little bit disappointing that this is all that opens up this is all you get this it's Fisher part of size I'd rather have it half of the glass so that's a little disappointing to see that um get the really light I do like the Alcantara headliner I do I do I can appreciate that and then if I close the sunshade okay so not cool stuff right there look this is an Alcantara though two times let's open the hood let's take a look at this engine this is your uh b-58 engine it is a inline 6 335 horsepower for this model 300 and I think it's 30 I'm happy to work but it's um I think for this one I look for like a little more power especially considering that this is a big heavy vehicle um it right now is is working um for it for example if you're not like a power junkie or you don't need it if you don't need the power this engine would be fine but um I can feel it when it's like some climbing a hill I notice it is downshifting a little bit more than I will probably what's back with the V8 trade-off you get 20 V8 and then six cylinders this engine um like I said it's 335 horsepower it was a lot of the trade-off is going to be um you're going to find that the gas mileage is going to be great on this one so this one's going to be 19 in the city and then it's going to be 24 in the highway which is good for the all-wheel drive the upcoming all-wheel drive the V8 held at hand you do get more power so you get 523 horsepower but this fuel mileage is going to be at uh once I think it's at 15 City 21 on the highway so Highway that the city mileage is where it's going to it's going to suffer uh the ace owner is just gonna it's just this thirsty engine um towing capacity is going to be the same on each car no matter which engine you choose from and then when you get the hitch you lose out of the kick the open tailgate so that's something to keep in mind now to 0-60 when I talk about the engines this performance wise 0 to 60 is 5.8 seconds which is respectable but when you compare it to the eight cylinder 5.8 the V8 m50i is 4.5 so um that is a noticeable difference especially the six miles an hour where that V8 is going to be at least a full second ahead and in a continuity accelerate um but only like I said is on your driving style for me I know what I like but like I said not everybody drives like I do so um you know pick what you you know obviously get your budget and your needs and everything else I don't think that this engine is bad I don't think that this is a car slow I think anything usually in today's standards as long as you have at least um a seven second or faster vehicle I think that's plenty for most people's needs C controls are here um you do have power um there's a power nose manual thigh extension uh I want to say maybe I think there's a seat upgrade here don't quote me I haven't I think there's a seat upgrade which gives you the power gives you a little bit more settings in here to adjust uh raising this up and down lowers the headrest power headrests um basic controlled lumbar you can raise and lowered lumbar um and then it's lumbar control right there telescopic steering wheel um you do have automatic high beam and then you can cycle through different modes such as the mileage or things you want to see honey uh should the drive press this unlock come back and drive you can just go neutral [Music] you can go over to sport mode with reverse and then presses it for Park you break electronic of course the right height settings right there the correspondence all this out shut that it's in a console you got USBC port so I have this uh little compartment here no pedals the M sport they're coming right here Harman Kardon sound system is standard Bowers and Wilkins is an upgrade all right and of course here with the BMWs always you get soft control so I can assign these as shortcuts not just preset for video I can do preset video if I like but I can have a shortcut take me to a navigation uh preference setting or radio preference setting or a typical screen or for example I don't know why on my BMWs I like to set the profile so I'll have one profile for me I just hit that one profile for my wife hit that notes what they do is they um configure your ambient lighting your seat Heating temperature in the car Music Choice it sort of can you're seeing what basically how you're feeling in it it's not a tailored secure mode um decided something else that we'll touch in there too the driver corner and here it is option um these are SPF driver quarter is a cool feature think of it like if you have if you're familiar with Tesla's sensory mode sup it doesn't record when the car's parked but for example when you get to an accident it can take the footage from the from the past like a couple minutes and it uses the cars 360 cameras to record the footag
60;BMW;2021 BMW X7;2021 BMW X7 vs 2021 BMW X5. Reviewing the X7 in depth! Car Reels | Episode 9;[Music] hi guys i'm henry and you're watching car wheels today we have two bmw suvs for you the bmw x7 and the bmw x5 and we're going to talk a little bit about the differences but mostly we're gonna focus on the x7 because i think it's an excellent utility vehicle bmw finally thinks about the people that are not just behind the steering wheel but also the people in the back [Music] so this car is actually so tall i don't have to get down to show you guys the grill is massive it's not the same shape and size as the new 4 series and m3 and 4 that's coming out but it's still quite ginormous i like it in black it's a little bit more sleek in the x5 it's chromey and it doesn't look as good as it does in black it has the bmw laser headlights which look quite nice and generally the bumpers have very very very similar shapes but the x7 is slightly bigger the hoods also have very similar shapes and that's because they are the same car underneath they have the same engine 333 horsepower and 330 foot pounds of torque i think bmw is hiding the true horsepower numbers because these cars really move much better than the power would suggest they're really quite heavy this car is roughly around 5000 pounds it starts at 4800 pounds uh with almost no options and this is almost a base car and it's still quite heavy the x5m competition it's really up there at 5500 pounds almost this is even heavier i mean it's heavier because it's loaded with tech it's got a third row which is extremely useful we're gonna get to that later now let's explore the sides of these cars the x7 is quite a long vehicle it's a very interesting vehicle up until here they look almost identical once you start moving back the x5 has a very sporty rear end and it looks really nice the x7 it's not that it doesn't look nice but it loses a little bit of a sporty flare it loses a little bit of bmw nest in some ways it's not necessarily a bad thing because it's not meant to be super interesting in the back but it does have bmw design language the exhaust tips are identical on both cars i do like that these exhaust tips are black and they're not chrome the black on the black trim really sort of accentuates the car makes it a little sleeker makes it a little bit more pleasing to look at now let's start this car from the back to the front the tailgate it has a split opening and i really really do like that now this may seem like a small trunk and this is loaded with a solar panel to charge the batteries it has some mats here that the dealer has put in the back because it is winter still and i do like that everything closes with a touch of a button now the trunk may seem small with the with the third row up but once the third row goes down it is really quite massive now moving to the back huge door it is a good thing that is ginormous because it gives you very easy entry to the rear of this car now let's go in the car and is just huge i have set up the front seat as my driving position and i've even moved it back a little bit because i'm not a big guy at 510 i'm not very tall and i don't take up a lot of space and i kind of like to sit close to the steering wheel so i move the seat back for a little bit more comfort and i have a huge amount of space here a huge amount of headroom the sunroof it's basically got three sunroof guys and it it's like it's like daytime in here and we're indoors and it still feels like i have so much light in here it does have a captain's chair option which is around 800 and it is absolutely worth it so getting inside this car getting inside this car is really not all that difficult now this these seats are painfully slow like you just really need to sit here for a long time as they go up still here still here still here all right let's go inside in the backseat this is the highlight feature of the x7 bmw for the first time has not only thought about the driver in the front seat and maybe the front passenger they've actually thought about the rear seats in this car and what a rear seat it is we had a guy who's six to come in here and sit beside me we did not rub shoulders we had leg room we had headroom we had space for our hands this car has a cup holder it even has nice trim that follows through with the rest of the theme of the car and once you bring the seat back do forgive it it is quite slow and don't think that you actually have to use things by hand there are buttons right here that you can control everything with i'm in here i have space i have headroom look how much headroom i have look at how much space is in here this is absolutely incredible and yeah that if i have one complaint about this car is the fact that this seat does move very slow but i i i will forgive it because the space in here is unreal it is incredible i can't stress enough if anybody needs an suv with a third row seat this is the suv for you full stop i have never been in the back of an suv in the third row that has as much space as this car has now moving up to the front the front of every bmw is always special because bmw primarily cares about the person behind the steering wheel as a passenger here i feel like i have slightly less space than the person all the way to the back sure i have good visibility but it feels a little bit more cramped maybe than the x5 just because it has to have had a little bit of space given to the rear you can't make this car look like a train so it's still it's still spacious don't get me wrong but it's it's bmw giving some priority to the rear seats and i really like that because that's the actual purpose of this vehicle to split the space between all three rows in a way that everybody feels relatively comfortable through here bmw design language they almost all look the same there's nothing wrong with that i kind of wish it was a little bit more distinguished but it is a nice place to be the materials are super premium everything feels very good the seats are very comfortable obviously there's absolutely nothing sporty or racy about this suv it does drive sporty enough for somebody who wants to enjoy giving it some throttle here and there but generally speaking this car for everyday usage is perfect for a third row seat suv is perfect i really do like this engine some people do suggest you get the the stronger v8 engine but the straight six in this car is plenty of power is silky smooth it drives really well it does roll a little bit but that's perfect because it means that the compromise is a very soft comfortable ride and that's exactly what you need in an suv like this okay so the front seat in here let's start this thing it's very smooth and soft the bmw noises are are classic it has all the gestures and it has all the features that you'd want it is fully loaded top to bottom with bmw tekken here i am quite fond of bmw interiors because they are a little bit more simple than other vehicles in audis things are sort of hidden under menus in here you have the eight preset shortcuts which look like radio buttons i know they double up as other features but this doesn't feel very modern to me i kind of hope bmw soon changes this layout and this format in here the cup holders in this are excellent it's one of the only german cars that's sort of starting to show a lot of attention to the cup holders and their placement the stuff down here is very good you have sport you have comfort you have eco pro you have adaptive and this car has a cool extra feature which raises and lowers the height of this car at its very lowest this car is extremely easy to go in and out of you don't get that weird step that you sometimes feel just brushing up against your leg as you leave in the lowest setting you can sort of almost walk out of this as if it's a car in its highest setting it really is really tall and it feels like it can go in places that normal suvs can't normally reach five different settings i'm not sure if it needed five i think i would have been okay with three settings but it has five if you really are very specific and it's as easy as pressing a button down here bmw center screen is excellent it is really quite large and i am a huge fan of how the display is it has a lot of features i will show you guys some of its more in-depth features through here uh if you go to car it basically gives you all the information you'd want you have the flow of the power and the engine you have an x-view which sort of gives you which ride height you're in and the compass it has the sport displays and you can see your g-meter you can see your your psi your temperatures how much torque and horsepower it's using i'm not sure if this is all that accurate but you know it it it's there if you really needed it i'm not sure you'd really want it in this car this is probably the thing you'd want the most in this car which is the fuel mileage now this car is decently good with fuel consumption because of bmw's way of managing torque down low i think it's really nice the way this car has torque at the at the earlier on rpm so you don't really need to push the throttle all the way down to sort of get the car moving it's a big car and you want the torque to be right at the lower rpm so it gets going easily and this car does that going through more through more settings we have sort of service engine oil tire pressure you know the generic car informations and then we you can control pretty much everything you'd want in here it does have a fancy key if you really want this car doesn't have that option but you can buy the fancy key this car has the standard bmw infotainment system and it's quite easy to use and i really do like it the menus are really easy to navigate the parking sensors in this car they're not the fancy equipped 360 cameras that you can move the car about like we showed you guys in the x5m a couple of weeks ago if you want to see that video click up on the pop-out banner right now it's really quite a fantastic car and we'd really recommend you guys go drive one of those sitting in here feeling the steering wheel the paddles feel really premium everything feels really premium this steering wheel is very familiar it's very very much the same steering wheel as it is in the x5 very similar in feel to the x5m it just doesn't have the same stitching it doesn't have the m blue and red stitching across but it still feels very nice the view out of here it's a nice view the side mirrors are a little bit small and they are small in basically all of the bmw suvs it's not necessarily a complaint because it's still got very good visibility but it feels like they could have been a bit bigger or at least the inner glass portion could have been a bit bigger there's very little complaints about this car the only things you might not like about it are things that are subjective like its looks or maybe you want a little bit of more modern interior like audi's multiple screen setup other than that this car i just see i just see very few flaws with it the one thing that i do dislike about this car is the way the doors close they're very large and not having a soft closing feature i have found myself trying to close the door multiple times and it's just hard to close on a first try it feels like you sort of have to slam it a little bit in a luxury car that feels a little bit counter-intuitive but minor complaint the rest of the car is excellent the the the roof liner is excellent the materials in here are excellent this car overall oozes sort of luxury and and excellence and it drives very silky smooth this is one of my more preferred suvs when it comes to third row cedars with seven seats i know this car is equipped with a captain chair so it only has six seats but it can comfortably sit six adults and i will take that over the middle seat which you will use in rare occasions and if you're gonna use that seat in rare occasions might as well have the captain chairs people will enjoy sitting here much better than being cramped with those other seats also makes getting in and out of the back much much easier the seats are slow but it d they do make life much easier going all the way to the back at the back here you can actually control the seats manually so if you want a maximum amount of people you can put all the seats up if you want the maximum amount of cargo you can actually press the space for cargo and all the seats will go automatically down and give you a very very very large trunk here with just a touch of a button now let's go check out the x5 not having the rear seats this trunk is massive and it's quite useful and this is even more useful it's got a very very durable material here which is a very nice touch from bmw it's just massive and i can see why you've had so much space for the other seats in the x7 a little bit of a longer car there's just so much space in here and it's a very usable trunk this is a very usable suv if you don't need space if you don't need more than five seats and you want to save yourself some money this car drives a little bit better than the x7 so i want to say if the space is not a priority for you this might be the better suv [Applause] sitting in this car there is almost no difference i feel like i've just moved on to a different bmw the seating position feels the same the mirrors are the same the steering wheel is the same the displays are the same the center console is the same it's missing the the ride adjustment because this car doesn't have it it doesn't feel any more cramped in here and that's because bmw has used space well in the x7 it feels very premium to be in here just as it does in that vehicle and there's really not much more you can say about the x5 compared to the x7 other than the fact that it doesn't have the same amount of room in the back it has a ginormous trunk it's extremely usable and it just doesn't have that third row otherwise it's essentially a very very very similar suv this does drive sportier it is much lighter it is better in the corners you will feel that every single day so sport is a little bit something that you want out of your everyday drive ability this is the suv for you this is definitely much easier to park this is much easier to live with because it's not so tall and it's not so long so it's really a personal preference and it does save you quite a bit of money this car equipped similarly you're gonna look at anywhere between 20 to 30 thousand dollars in savings with this vehicle over the x7 now if i am being completely honest with you having the same features other than the ride height change and the rear seat trickery and maybe the extra sunroof that is in that car but you don't need it in here because it would just be over the trunk it's just simply i fail to see that necessity for the x7 if you don't need the space 20 000 plus dollars is quite a lot of money to save and you get essentially a sportier suv so if that's something you care about the x5 is for you and if you really want to go all out and get the sportiest version of this car the x5m is for you and that is an incredible vehicle [Applause] all right guys so to conclude the differences between the x7 and the x5 are essentially after the front cabin and back so if you really want space this is the one to get if you want a little bit of sport and you want a little bit of drivability was still with a good amount of utility the x5 will also do the job this is a slightly less expensive suv but it still offers the exact same premium quality as the x7 so it's really a personal preference or maybe you must have the third row seating and therefore the x7 would be the better suv for you i do like the looks of both of these suvs they are very similar they have the essentially the same essence they are very bmw interiors are nearly identical if not completely identical and i want to say i'm pleasantly surprised with the x7s rear seating space it was mind-blowing and i really really urge you guys to go take a look at this car if it's something that you're interested in if it's if it's the third row seat is important to you definitely give yourselves the chance to go look at one of these because they are absolutely incredible machines thank you so much for watching please like and subscribe don't forget to comment below i really quite like the x7 and this grill on the x5 is not doing it justice but in a nice trim the x5 looks really really sharp so see you guys next week [Applause] [Music]

61;Jaguar;2021 F-Pace;2021 Jaguar F-pace review - Best SUV in this segment? TEST DRIVE D200 R-DESIGN (Facelift) UK 4K;[Music] hello and welcome back to another video from auto social uk back in 2016 when jaguar launched the f-pace it was considered a bit of a risk for jaguar to release an suv but since that time it's become the jaguar's fastest selling product selling nearly quarter of a million worldwide and it's easy to see why this car offers so much practicality but still has that classic really timeless jaguar styling if you like new car reviews and you're just finding my channel now then please don't forget to go ahead and hit the subscribe button i'd love to have you join me on my channel okay let's get into the rest of the video the jaguar f-pace has had a well-needed revamp for 2021. the exterior already looked great however they've just had some design tweaks which has elevated it further they've also made some changes on the interior which have made a huge amount of difference which i'll go into later starting off with the bonnet this has now a much more aggressive hump and also on the previous car it used to have a bonnet shut around here which was a little bit unsightly however they've now brought it forward and it has a much more sleeker seamless design as you can see the bonnet does also overhang the light slightly and gives it a more aggressive look you know like a race me face you know like okay that wasn't the best race face but you get what i'm trying to say they also have some redesigned front headlights which now feature a double j on the previous cars they just had a singular j and these look really good this car is actually fitted with the black pack which is around 650 pounds but completely changes the style of the car you've got a black front grille you've also got the black surround of these air vents and also a black gloss front splitter in my opinion this is the best view of the jaguar f pace it really does look sleek and stylish unfortunately that black pack might be quite good value for money at 615 pounds but if you also wanted privacy glass that's going to cost you a further 415. around the back the design changes have continued and you no longer have some physical tailpipes because jackie will want to come across as a much cleaner brand after all they say that they're going to be completely electric by 2025. you've also got some redesigned rear lights which have been taken from the jaguar i-pace convenience is key with an suv and the r-dynamic se does come standard with an electric tailgate the f-pace's boot boasts 613 liters which is bigger than the mccanns and only 20 liters smaller than you'll find in the porsche cayenne from the class above the facelift has also brought a new engine lineup including three diesels ranging from 161 brake horsepower to the car that i have today which gets 204 brake horsepower to a three liter six cylinder with 296 brake horsepower there's also three petrols in all including a plug-in hybrid most of the engines other than the plug-in are also now mildly electrified inside of the f-pace is where we've seen the most change and it's showcased by this 11.4 inch touchscreen now previously the system in the jaguar f-pace was a little lacking it was slightly laggy and it was just lacking in all the equipment that you get in modern cars however this system is completely different so this is actually the pivi pro system that you get in the new land rover defender and it really is a great system it's super crisp as you can see i've got the 3d map showing at the moment you've also got all of your apple carplay and android auto as you'd expect but you've also got the 360 degree cameras which really are quite fancy and especially for when parking with such large wheels these are really handy to make sure that you can zoom in and you're not going to hit any of those alloys despite the fact that this screen has been chemically strengthened and also has a dual coating of anti-glare to reduce fingerprints you do still get a lot of fingerprints so you're going to want to keep a little cloth in the car to always be wiping it clean jaguar say that the new system on this pivi pro 2.0 means that everything up to 90 of it is found with just two clicks away and it is a lot quicker and more responsive the interior quality of the jaguar f-pace has also improved sufficiently you've got lots of new materials including a lot of this chrome almost steel fill which i really like there's a really good weight to the paddles which is really enjoyable you've also got some steel across the center console mixed in with some levers of course you've got some really nice soft levers across the dash and on the steering wheel but if you delve a little bit deeper then you do start to find some scratchy plastic but at least it's hidden one thing i found a little bit strange and it took some getting used to is when you first see this little screen at the bottom here it looks like it should be touch sensitive however i was prodding at all of these buttons and nothing was really happening i thought it was broken after talking to jaguar they're actually touch sensitive so you have to apply some pressure once you apply some pressure it will bring up all of your settings you also will need to twiddle these dials to change your temperature but pull them out to change your fan speed which i think if you don't have that explained to you it might be a little bit difficult to find the car doesn't come standard with an electric sunroof and you have two options you can have a standard sunroof or you can have this one which is electronically sliding now this is a 1600 pound option but i definitely think it's worth having especially when you have the dark headlining it just brings a lot of light into the cabin and makes it feel a lot more spacious so what has changed about the new f-pace well mainly they've scrapped a few options so you can no longer get the entry-level rear-wheel drive they're all now four-wheel drive and you also can no longer get the manual gearbox they're all fitted with the eight-speed zf gearbox as i mentioned previously the car that i'm driving is fitted with the d200 engine which is a two liter four-cylinder turbocharged diesel producing 204 brake horsepower now this car seems to have a little bit of a split personality because when i was first driving it at low speeds it felt a little bit underwhelming there didn't seem to be much power beneath my right foot but that's because i wasn't applying it particularly strongly as soon as you are a bit firmer with that right foot the car just completely changes its personality it goes from being a really soft kind of quiet car to quite an aggressive car that deals really good with your inputs my only advice is that if you are gonna pick a car i probably wouldn't go for the entry level diesel engine it has around 150 brake horsepower and i just don't think it would be enough to lug such a large car because every version is now fitted with four-wheel drive this is sure to help in slippery conditions should you find yourself in a grass car park or wintry weather and while the f-pace isn't really meant for off-road driving jaguar have been able to borrow a lot of know-how from sister brand land rover still the jaguar's limited road clearance large alloy wheels and sporty tyres mean that the discovery sport is probably going to be a better bet if you live somewhere really rugged despite the fact that all of the cars are now fitted with a four-wheel drive system the jaguar f-pace won't use that unless it feels like the extra grip is needed most of the time it's gonna behave like a rear-wheel drive car although a hundred percent of the car's power can be sent to the front wheels if needed the development work that jaguar have performed on the f-pace's suspension has definitely paid off as potholes and poor road surfaces are noticeably smoothed out it also grips exceptionally well with a satisfying precision to the turn-in and decent feedback through the wheel of course it's not the most extreme on the rails suv that you can buy but it's also not overly soft it's just a beautifully assured all-rounder both this jaguar f-pace and also the xf scored really highly in the end cap independent crash testing and that's mostly due to the strong bodywork and also the whole host of safety equipment that's on offer those include things like traffic sign recognition lane departure warning and autonomous emergency braking the f-pace also makes a pretty good tow vehicle it can tow up to 2400 kilograms which is about enough for a large caravan although that will reduce to 2000 if you go for the plug-in p400e model once again jaguar blow me away with just how timeless but also modern and exciting their cars can be and all things considered when you compare this to some of the competitors i think it's great value for money and talking about competitors jaguar marshall ipswich want me to invite you to an event on the 3rd of june where they're going to have all of their competitor cars to pin against their jaguars just to prove to you why you should buy a jaguar so if you've been considering between certain brands then why not get down to that event and test them all at the same time i'll pop the details in the description box if you've enjoyed this video please go ahead and

62;Jaguar;2021 F-Pace;Jaguar F-Pace 2021 review | Chasing Cars;i'm tom baker this is chasing cars and this is the facelifted jaguar f-pace a vehicle that i personally think is one of the best-looking suvs on the road the jaguar f-pace has really turned around the fortunes of the jaguar brand since this crossover launched several years ago it is by far the most popular vehicle that jaguar has built in the last decade and even though this brand's slinky sedans and two-door coupes and convertibles are really where my particular heart lies the f-pace is a very good mid-sized luxury suv as we'll find out later in today's video it's a good car to drive and now thanks to the 2021 facelift i think it even looks a touch better outside and the interior is a more sumptuous place to spend time as well now the bug bear with owning a jaguar at least here in australia has always been that the warranty has been a little bit shorter than some rivals particularly since mercedes-benz moved to a five-year warranty more than a year ago well jaguar land rover are now doing exactly the same thing this car comes with a five-year warranty and five years of roadside assist included so i think that gives you just that little bit of extra peace of mind to buy into something a little bit more left field which i think is what a jaguar f-pace kind of is compared to a mercedes glc or an audi q5 or you know the cars are a little bit bigger than that as well so we're going to take a look in the cabin we're going to have a look at the boot and then we'll take this f-pace out onto the road to see what jaguar's largest suv is like to drive but before we get started make sure to hit subscribe down below if you haven't already the refreshed exterior of the jaguar f-pace is really quite subtle and that makes sense because this was already a great looking suv in my books but the interior was starting to get tired and that's been addressed in the 2021 changeover to the f-pace basically the entire dashboard shape has been redone and that's unusual for a facelift it's actually quite a costly change but in this case it actually really benefits the jaguar f-pace now the standard item is this new slate touchscreen which gets closer to a square format if not quite entirely square it's really snappy it's what jlr call their pv pro system you can see it responds to the touch relatively well you can pair up your phone with bluetooth there isn't wireless apple carplay or android auto we do have those technologies via usb cable and it works really well with such a large canvas on this display now there's still a pretty cool trick climate control system down here where you push and pull the controls to change things like your temperature your fan speed heated seats and the like that works quite well you also get this new uh steering wheel that's already been seen in the refreshed xe i think it looks really great love this small little airbag cover now the actual buttons themselves don't always respond perfectly to the touch i found myself having to hit the next track button a couple of times here and there but eventually it gets through and then we look through on this particular car at a fully digital instrument cluster that's very configurable you can put media trip computer information a full map in there you really can do whatever you like which is pretty great and quality feels excellent in here both in terms of the materials that have been used which all feel pretty plush but also the way the car is screwed together if you go looking for them you will find a few creaky noises in some of the components that move but it's really nothing more than what you'd expect to find in an audi q5 or q7 for example so i don't think it's really a detractor for the f-pace comfort is great even on the base seat it's really sumptuous really comfortable and supportive but if you upgrade to these 18-way adjustable seats you get things like inflating bolsters and a thigh extender that will let you really find the most ideal driving position now this car is elegantly specified in navy blue outside over this very light cream leather and open pour wood trim and the good thing about the f-pace is it's actually a lot more customizable than rival vehicles in terms of colors and specs so you don't have to get a black pack you can most of the cars on today's launch of the f-pace had it but this one is more traditionally specced and i think it actually comes up really nicely you can also go for blacks inside or a tan or this cream there are other choices too and later when the svr hot version arrives it'll have a really focused cabin now in terms of practicality we've got wireless smartphone charging that actually holds the phone and works which isn't always the case with wireless charging big cup holders an adjustable armrest with a big box and two usb ports both the new style and the old style and large door bins too so up front there's really quite little to fault about the updated f-pace here in the back of the f-pace it's a good opportunity to remind ourselves of what this vehicle's competitors actually are and a bit like the lexus rx the jaguar f-pace is something of an in-betweener it's a little bit bigger than a mercedes glc but smaller than a gle and the same goes for the bmw x3 and x5 so you're getting a relatively big medium suv if that makes sense and that does mean that the f-pace is only a five-seater if you're looking for a seven seater jaguar can't help you but you will be able to step across the showroom floor into something like a range rover sport which you can get with a third row or even the smaller land rover discovery sport although the third row in that car is a massive punish here in the jag what you get is a generously proportioned five-seat car so in the second row you will be able to get adults in without too many complaints for myself at six foot headroom is no issue even though this car is optioned with a very large panoramic sunroof legroom behind the driving position is generous i've got several inches toe room is great as well because there's a cut out beneath the seat now the middle seat is a little bit of a perch and the tunnel in the floor is quite high but the actual footwells themselves are pretty big so i think you could actually get someone in the middle if you needed to plus the amenities back here are okay we've got air vents keep the air flowing on a hot day heated outboard seats in the rear always a luxurious touch on a cold morning those soft materials and stitch leather in the back continue from up front as does the open pore wood trim very nice and also the intricate grilles for the meridian sound system that you get at this level in the range there's also a flip down armrest with two cupholders and map pockets on the back of the seat although if you're looking for usb ports in the back you won't find them there's only a 12 volt socket moving around here to the back of the updated jaguar f-pace you'll need to be a jag fan to spot the differences with the facelifted car because they are quite subtle but they are absolutely there the new tail light design kind of matches the slimmer headlights which i think have actually helped the car there's also subtle changes to the bumpers and some new alloy wheel designs including the 21 inch wheels optioned up onto this d300se that i'm driving here now you do get a power tailgate as standard that operates quite promptly and gets out of your way and it reveals a decently practical 650 liter boot now as you can see it's really square the load height isn't too high it's also not that low not as low as the xf sport brake was for example but you will get several large suitcases in without too much of an issue a few clever touches cargo blind gets up and out of your way so you don't have to keep moving it underneath the boot floor you get a spare wheel which gives you a bit of confidence for country touring what we also have is some netting over here for delicate stuff a couple of hooks so that your bags don't flop around 12 volt socket tie down points we don't get remote releases to drop those back seats from the boot that's one thing that would be convenient also there's no lock button on the tailgate so you do have to close it and then lock the car which i think most people will be able to cope with but some rivals have integrated a dual button all right let's look at the practicality let's now head out onto the road so what's the updated jaguar f-pace like to drive well with any facelift there's never going to be a radical change to the driving dynamics of a car but in the case of the f-pace that's a good thing because jaguar had already approached this suv when they developed it to be one of the best driving vehicles in its class and that is a characteristic that the f-pace has been able to maintain over the last several years that being said there are some changes to note particularly in terms of the engine lineup and i'll get into those things in this video and in fact we'll start there with what you can get under the bonnet because in fact there's only one engine that truly carries over in its entirety from last year's lineup which had 18 different variations that's now been reduced to only six so while there's less choice there was arguably a few too many variations of jaguar land rovers products before the most recent rationalization and given that you can still customize the car to a significant extent i think six is probably about the right number but the range starts with the carryover unit and that is the p250 four-cylinder petrol or turbocharged two-liter unit from jaguar land rover's ingenium modular combustion engine family and that produces 184 kilowatts of power and 365 newton meters of torque and i spent all morning today driving a base p250 running on 19-inch wheels and it's actually a really lovely unit uh you might think the base petrol isn't enough to motivate the f-pace uh but actually it is it feels entirely content driving this car there's heaps of torque available just off idle and actually the four-cylinder petrol has a really nice z-note uh when you rev it out so it even has a bit of kind of enjoyment in the oral sense to it i think it's a really good spot for the range to open and given that car is considerably more affordable than it used to be and it has more standard equipment all in all it's a pretty competitive offer particularly when you consider that the entry-level petrol engines you get in most of this car's rivals are significantly weedier you definitely wouldn't call the f-pace p250 wedi that being said the six-cylinder engines are undoubtedly the desirable ones even if the p250 four-cylinder is more than enough i think a lot of people are going to be uh you know swooned by the diesel or the petrol six-cylinder option now the car i'm driving now is the d-300 inline six turbocharged diesel and for 2021 it also picks up a 48 volt mild hybrid system outputs have been bumped slightly to 221 kilowatts of power and 650 newton meters of torque and this engine is just effortless i know that's a cliche to describe large displacement diesels but it's true there's heaps of talk on offer here if you're thinking of towing with this car the d300 is where you'd probably want to put your money it doesn't really sound like a diesel it just has that kind of low bassy note when you accelerate that i think is really quite appealing actually it has some intent to it it also delivers the best fuel economy of the lineup particularly because there's no more four-cylinder based diesel um this is actually the only diesel you can get on the f-pace at this point when i say at this point i mean this is probably the only diesel i ever offer again on the f-base particularly because of the news we've had in the last month that jaguar will transition to an all-electric brand over the next five years and so if you're thinking of buying a car like this with a combustion engine there's not going to be that many more chances after this and i think it's it's an interesting moment to be driving or probably be the last diesel-powered uh jaguar f-base and it's a good one there's also a six-cylinder petrol engine which is really quite zesty that's the p400 it produces 294 kilowatts of power and 550 newton meters of torque again assisted by a 48 volt mile hybrid system like the diesel surprisingly efficient you'll do kind of low double figures in combined driving despite the fact it's really quite sprightly just as we found in the land rover defender where you can also get that engine it sounds good it's got heats of go you're probably detecting a thread here that there's no bad engine on the f-pace and that is precisely how it is but if you want the biggest and the baddest the f-pace svr facelift will be arriving in about june july 2021 that's a 5 liter supercharged v8 putting out 405 kilowatts of power and 700 newton meters of torque with about a 4 second 0 to 100 time uh and that thing sounds phenomenal so if you're in the market for uh you know a glc63 or an x3m it's probably worth waiting to test drive the facelifted svr as well now in terms of ride and handling that's actually where the f-pace shines the brightest and a lot of that is kind of embedded into the fundamentals of this car we've got jlr's iq al2 aluminium chassis on this car and that keeps it nice and light the most fascinating thing is that the large ish f paste is actually considerably lighter than the e-pace small suv the jaguar cell and that's because it's you know effectively all aluminium and that impacts everything about the way the f-pace gets down the road it means the ride is more subtle because there's less weight to have to damp it means the turn-in is more immediate it means the limits of this car in corners are higher you know it is still a relatively tall suv but in so many ways it drives like a station wagon the dynamics are really impressive in this car and particularly so in the lower end specs that benefit from a smaller alloy wheel a 19-inch wheel on the base vehicle and a chunky tyre which actually just gives the f-pace an impeccable ride quality this navy blue d300 that i'm driving now has optional 21-inch wheels 20s are standard at this level and the ride is still impressive though you definitely get a bit more road feel it doesn't diminish massively it's still very bearable but this is one of those cars where i think occasionally less is more and the package is now so well rounded at the entry point i do question the need to even step up to the big wheels and uh more and more equipment i think you can spend you know kind of less than 90 grand on road in this car and have a pretty nice luxurious suv experience but still the six cylinder engines are super desirable as well there's better road holding and more grip than in a glc or an x3 i reckon the steering's lovely it's not packed with feel but it's super precise and accurate and the ratio is perfect so you get as much steering as you expect you're gonna get when you start to turn the wheel on this car you sit relatively high a feature probably inherited from the land rover vehicles that uh are also produced by this company so the view outs good it's not low and slinky and legs right out forward like a jaguar f-type but that's okay so you know even though it's not traditionally jaguar-ish it still has lovely dynamics supple ride good handling a great set of engines and it's pretty refined as well uh and you know the big the big elephant in the room has been the three year warranty for the last few years not many people really want to take a punt on a jaguar with a three-year warranty uh you know reliability has improved but it still hasn't been quite up to the level of some rivals but i think with a longer warranty and also five years of roadside assist i'd be a lot closer personally to you know taking a punt on this car because it is just so much more desirable than something like a four-cylinder glc i reckon everything about it is significantly more luxurious yeah it's an interesting car definitely worth a test drive if you're in the market so those are my impressions of the updated 2021 jaguar f-pace there's still a lot to like about this suv it's super elegant to look at in my opinion the interior is a pleasant place to spend time and it's now even more tech centric and the driving dynamics are just about as good as you'll find in this segment and of course there's the fire breathing supercharged v8 svr still to arrive here in australia now given the longer warranty and all the other benefits of the car are you considering a jaguar f-pace do you own one now what's your experience been like let me know down below in the comments while you're there make sure you hit subscribe if you

it but before i do i'm going to tell you something you really really know and that is jaggi has just made an announcement they've announced that by 2025 all of their new cars are going to be electric only that means that that f-base could be the last jaguar you own with an engine we better pick the right one that's what i hope to help you do now those are the time codes right there if you just want to jump ahead you can rifle through it pretend it's a sock draw go for your life and down there the chapter markers same thing go for it if you want to read the full review go to carsguy.com.u give us a like and subscribe everybody is it's free design ah it's beautiful and not that that the f-pace so the f-pace came out in 2016 and even after all these years i still think it's the most beautiful suv in the world but there have been some changes here's what's new there's a new face the bonnet now goes all the way to meet the grill the previous car had a nose cone this looks far better the grill is also larger and see those shapes in the mesh it's modeled in the shape of the jaguar heritage logo that'll impress your friends at the bbq the new headlights are slimmer and the led running lights have this new design too the taillights are different too the previous ones had the dip molded into the tailgate now they're a blade but the dips are still there in the led design and it's still a very big hat tip to the f-type sports car and its rear bumper has been redesigned too the f-pace's insides have been updated as well just about everything you can see here is new there's the larger screen the climate control now has these chunky knobs and the steering wheel is new too and it's goodbye rotary shifter and g'day to this regular upright shifter with cricket ball stitching it's a sporty luxurious cabin price and features june talk prices let's talk prices okay that's the entire lineup right there as you can see it starts at 76k for the entry grade car and heads north all the way to the svr for about 142 000 it's worth it though it's it's amazing now you'll notice as well they've all got our dynamic in front of their names and that's because the aerodynamic pack's been so popular that jagger's just made it standard on all of them you want to talk standard features me too let's go all f-paces come with the new 11.4 inch touchscreen apple carplay and android auto there's keyless entry push button start dual zone climate power adjustable front seats leather upholstery those led headlights and tail lights and the auto tailgate the entry s and the sc above it come with a six speaker stereo while the hsc and the svr comes standard with a 13 speaker meridian sound system engine specs there are four engines to choose from there's the d300 which is the turbo diesel there's the p250 which is a petrol four cylinder there's the p400 and that's a six cylinder inline six turbo petrol and then the top is the big daddy or the big mama it's a five liter v8 to the p550 now all have eight-speed automatic transmissions and all are all-wheel drive practicality the f-pace is a five-seater mid-sized suv now i'm i'm far from mid-sized myself i'm 191 centimeters tall actually but i can still sit behind my driving position look that sits in my driving position i've got that much room that much and headroom headroom's excellent back here too storage has been improved for this f-pace and in another win for practicality the location of the windows pictures has been changed that's right they used to be up here and i complained incessantly to jaguar about it now look where they are down here you're welcome do you want to look at the boot it's it's around the back come on come on okay so yeah oh you've gone around that way yeah so the f-pace has a 509 litre boot which is pretty good pretty good for the glass what okay let's drive driving all right let's go for a drive now i'm in the very entry car the p250 now it's not the d300 with the turbo diesel it's it's not the p400 the inline six and it's not the big daddy svr sits at the top of the range but you are still getting a brilliant suv in this p250 the four-cylinder if you're worried about it not producing enough grunt do not worry it makes 180 odd kilowatts and that's plenty of grunt that's v8 outputs from you know a few decades ago so don't worry it's still really grunty and it's very responsive as well eight-speed automatic transmission is good too okay so what's new the suspension's new when i say new it's been it's been tuned so what they've done is they've softened it a little bit made a little bit more composed especially at the back uh the rear suspension of the old car was quite firm so you come around a corner like this and you hit a hit a mid corner bump like like that one just there and it would feel a bit skittish quite quite brittle and firm this one is a lot more compliant and a lot more composed and oh god this is good this is the entry car and it's really good sorry i'm getting distracted by how much fun this is the also fun is the p400 that inline six in that car is brilliant i drove up here this morning in it it's great if you don't step up to the v8 and you're hunting for torque and and power then that inline six is hard to go past the steering feels as sharp as it ever was it's always been a really sharp steering car you only have to think a direction and you go it ah it doesn't have luxurious steering which is like you know you get into some luxurious suvs and it's this big long busboy or or this big slow bus wheel that takes ages to turn and it's very light this is a little bit heavier and a lot more direct so you only have to sort of like do that and you go that way like that it's very good for sporty driving now what's visibility like because you're going to be driving this daily um look i've lived with one daily i've reviewed the previous one of you lots of incarnations of it and look the rear window is quite small but you've got a surround view camera um this a-pillar does not get in the way at all it actually curves around so you can see past pretty well and those rear windows are quite large too and there's that rear quarter window is quite good too for for visibility and parking oh this is good seriously how they can make an suv behave like a sports car i don't know but this feels good yeah great handling good comfort and what 76 thousand dollars for this particular car do like that inline six though all right should we talk about safety safety the f-pace was given the maximum five-star end cap rating when it was tested in 2017 keep in mind that it is 2021 now but still it comes with aeb blind spot assistance lane keeping assistance traffic sign recognition adaptive cruise control front and rear parking sensors and a surround view camera and there's this jaguar badge and the reason why i really like it is because in the old model there was a big plastic plate around it that plate was the adaptive cruise control radar plate and they needed it now they don't anymore do you know why because they made the jaguar badge bigger and it sits right there much neater looking fuel use jaguar says that after a combination of open and urban roads the fuel economies range from 7.0 liters per hundred 7.8 for the four-cylinder petrol 8.7 for the six-cylinder petrol and 11.7 for the svr 5-liter v8 i didn't think i'd remember all those did you well i do i'm disappointed i'm disappointed that a plug-in hybrid is not in australia and it might not come either ownership didn't know that oh oh sorry as far as the warranty goes jaguar's got to some pretty big news as well there's a five-year unlimited kilometer warranty now that's much better than before and very good for a prestige car as for servicing service intervals don't really exist the car itself will tell you when it needs to be serviced and that's for paying for them you can pay as you go or there are pre-paid plans oh wow look how much room they give you to write notes look at all that note room plenty of notes love a good note verdict okay it is score time so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to give each section an individual score out of 10 and they're going to give the entire f-pace range an overall score out of 10. now let's begin with design it's even more beautiful than it's ever been i'm giving a 9 out of 10. for practicality i'm giving it an 8 big boot plenty of rear legroom really good rear headroom and also the window switches they've moved them down thank you for safety i'm giving an eight out of ten it's got all the things you expect it to have it could do with more though for ownership i'm giving an eight out of ten well done jaguar for moving to a five-year unlimited kilometer warranty also if you're getting one of these cars go for the pre-paid plans too eight out of ten okay for price i'm giving it an eight it's pretty well equipped it's leather from the base car up there could be more there i'm not gonna give it a nine i'm giving it an eight for price for the engines and transmission i'm giving it a nine out of ten again that five liter v8 is brilliant but so are the four cylinder petrols nine out of ten and fuel economy i'm giving it a seven i know shock horror but i really believe that it's 2021 and there needs to be a plug-in hybrid in this range there is a plug-in hybrid f-pace it hasn't come to australia yet i'd like to see it here now for driving i'm giving it 8 out of 10. i love the svr we haven't driven that today but i have before in the past and it's brilliant but even the lower grade such as the p250 are brilliant to drive as well eight out of ten now the overall score for the entire f-pace range comes to 8.1 out of 10. now if you want to read the full review go to carsguy.com.u remember give us a like and subscribe oh and don't forget 2025 i've got four years left of jaguars with

64;Jaguar;2021 F-Pace;2021 Jaguar F Pace | What has changed?;[Music] this is the model year 2021 jaguar f-pace and today i'm going to take you around the key differences between this and the previous shape jaguar f-pace i'm matt smart and this is rybrook tv hang on that sounds loud this is gonna be epic [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] how about that montage looks pretty good this card doesn't it well let's start with the front end these lights here the double sort of led effect in these really cool it's got this eyebrow thing going on here which kind of makes the car look like it's always aggressive and always ready to go we've got the new grille here which is the honeycomb effect it looks so cool doesn't it and look at this camera this camera in here is for the 360 parking which we'll get onto a little bit later the front bumper has been slightly redesigned just to give it a more angular and more aggressive look i think jaguar has really succeeded in doing that cracking looking front end isn't it look how aggressive it is always looks like it's ready to go [Music] moving along the side of the f-pace not a whole load has actually changed although on this car we've got this really cool wheel design down here these are 20 inches and finished in black they look really cool against this eiger grey paint this little vent down here that's new we've got the jaguar logo on there one thing that hasn't changed with the f-pace is the practicality you've got two very big doors and the back one has plenty big enough to be able to get a child seat or the kids or the granny or the dog anything you want to get in there plenty of space but we'll touch a little bit more on the interior shortly around the rear there are a few subtle little differences starting with the rear lights now if you use the link in the top of the screen to go and watch our f-type walk around you'll recognize these lights because they're from the f-type down the back here the rear bumper has been redesigned and what jaguar have done is get rid of the exhaust pipes so it makes for a much cleaner design around the rear let's check out boot space because it's massive there's loads of room in here and it's electric always useful now there's plenty of space in here for a staycation and even more this car is available with a plethora of accessories so you can get a bike rack you can get a pet pack in here you can have a tow bar fitted so you can tow it is the perfect vehicle for a uk staycation and if you'd like any more information or to find out anything about the accessories that are available on this car or any jaguar for that matter use the link in the top of the screen or in the description below let's go and have a look at what's changed inside shall we electric lovely i think it's in here where things are really different let's start directly in front of me with this steering wheel first seen on the eye pace and ever since then ever since i drove an ipace i've wanted this steering wheel on the rest of the range and now it's here it feels great and these shift paddles behind really high quality listen to that proper directly in front of me as well we've got the digital display so you can set this to pretty much anything you want moving around to the center and a big difference is this the new pivi pro infotainment system it's great it really is great this little screen here really crisp the definition on there is really great the new infotainment system proper proper good system this you can get android auto and apple carplay as well which is a big bonus moving further down the air conditioning controls have been made really crisp really simple really modern they look great i love the gear selected down here it fits perfectly with your hand it's really easy to use everything in general has just been made much simpler much crisper and much more modern and i think they've done a cracking job another thing that i love directly above me this panoramic sunroof is lovely and especially on a day like today letting in so much light spot on bravo jaguar earlier i mentioned the little camera on the front that's to do with the 360 cameras now let me show you because this is so cool so press the little button down here cameras how amazing does that look i mean it's look at the definition of that we've got the grass we've even got i mean look at it it's amazing that's so so impressive now i think we now need to go and have a look and see if the model year 2021 f-pace drives any differently let's go do that so then how does the model year 2021 f-pace drive well i have to say it feels lovely plenty of feedback through the steering wheel on this new steering wheel is a masterpiece in the shift paddles as i've already mentioned really lovely to use engine feels more than poke enough this is the two liter four-cylinder diesel engine plenty of poke in there and the ride feels really pliant and good on these really bouncy british b-roads i would also say though that even though this feels very comfortable you can still feel that dna in it you can still feel that sporty dna because it still has a little bit of a hard edge to it which is a very good thing because it still can attack corners with a real vigor that i think is really integral to this car so i love all the little changes i think jaguar have has refreshed this car in a way that still makes it feel like a brand new model and in a way it kind of is if you'd like any more information on the jaguar f-pace or any jaguar for that matter please

65;Jaguar;2021 F-Pace;NEW Jaguar F-Pace 2021 review: a luxury SUV you can actually afford;this is the new jaguar f-pace and by new i mean face lifted you see jaguar is going through its range at the moment giving its cars new engines and revamped interiors that are made of nicer materials and crammed full of new tech so what we're gonna do today is go over all of the updates to this f-pace and see whether it can now hold its own against the likes of the bmw x3 and audi q5 but before i get into the review why not hit the like button and subscribe because we've got plenty more awesome videos just like this one now let's start off with pricing the new and improved f-pace comes in at 41 000 pounds that's for the base car that you see here you can also get the r dynamic which makes it look a little bit sportier now that starts at 43 000 but if you want the full fat 5 liter supercharged v8 svr model then you're going to be paying 77 000 pounds but what i thought i'd do is i went on the yes auto app to see what prices are like and there are already plenty of deals on new and nearly new f-paces those are 2021 cars so it's not like you're gonna have to pay full price if you don't want to admittedly it's quite hard to tell the difference between a new f-pace and an old one because although this is a facelift it's a very minor one indeed so the big changes are a new larger grille this is the biggest suv that you can currently buy in jaguar's range so that larger grille just kind of sets it apart from its baby sibling the e-pace you also have a new led head and tail light cluster the front bumper is now a little bit more angular and the same can be said for the rear bumper too we've got 19-inch wheels here but you can spec them all the way up to 20 ones and that's about it really but the f-pace was already a very good-looking car so jaguar thought why not spend a little bit of money on updating the exterior and then the rest of it on improving the interior the interior has been completely redesigned and it's a huge improvement over the old car in fact it now feels like a much more luxurious product and if anything it now feels like it's worthy of the jaguar name for instance the center console is all new and now features a different shifter design replacing the dial in the old car the good thing is you can now rest your hand in it while driving along a bit like you can in an audi but the cup holders can get in the way a little bit the climate settings are now activated through touch controls but changing the temperature crucially is done through good old-fashioned dials that feeds out of a revised vent system that now merges seamlessly with the new dashboard layout and the overall build quality is a big step up from the old car with lots of leather and this model comes with a very tasteful wood trim the big improvement though comes with the tech and it's all highlighted by this infotainment system it's a kind of concave screen that makes it look as though it's draped neatly over the dashboard the 11.4 inch panel runs the company's new infotainment software which not only looks stunning but is one of the most responsive panels around even apple carplay is really well optimized taking up most of the available screen space our f-pace s comes with a hybrid instrument panel with analog dials and a digital display in the middle a full digital system is available and you can check that out in our xf review by clicking the link in the top right hand corner all cars though are really well equipped but there is the odd optional extra and some of them are what i would consider core features particularly for a car costing 40 odd thousand pounds wireless charging for instance which we've got in this car will set you back 300 quid still there's plenty of legroom in the back and the same can also be said for headroom as well and the boot measures in at 650 liters which obliterates the competition in fact it's so big you could pretty much live in it what's really impressive though is that this is one of the entry-level cars it's the f-pace s which comes in at around 42 000 pounds so if an entry-level car can feel like this then you're not really going to feel too guilty spending 50 or even 60 000 pounds further up the line we've got a new lineup of engines most of which come slightly electrified now the range kicks off with three diesels so two of them are based around a two liter motor available in either 161 or 202 brake horsepower form and you also get a three liter producing 296 bhp now they all come with 48 volt mild hybrid systems which deep sound a little bit more fuel and will give you a helpful boost when pulling away from a set of traffic lights there are also two normal petrol engines one of which is a two liter motor producing 247 bhp and there's also a three liter straight six with 396 bhp and that also gets mild hybrid tech as well but the big addition under the bonnet though is the p400e plug-in hybrid now that's based around a two liter engine and is connected up to an electric motor and combined they produce 400 brake horsepower but you also get a 17.1 kilowatt-hour battery meaning you can drive the phev on electric power alone for up to 33 miles it's pretty quick too it'll go from zero to 62 miles an hour in 5.1 seconds now performance is your thing then you'll want to go for the svr which comes with a 5 liter supercharged v8 engine producing 542 brake horsepower now like the rest of the range it gets an eight-speed automatic gearbox and all-wheel drive meaning this thing goes from zero to 62 miles per hour in four seconds dead well not this one this is the bog standard one but you get the idea [Music] there may be lots of updates under the bonnet and on the inside but thankfully jaguar hasn't touched the way the f-pace drives because like many of its cars the f-pace is fantastic behind the wheel and that's for a multitude of reasons the things that really stand out is the way that it steers it's got kind of a sporty feel to it which isn't to everybody's taste when it comes to an suv even though they're sports utility vehicles but it just means that you have a really good idea of the kind of vehicle that you're driving because you've got a little bit of weight it kind of makes you realize that you're driving a bigger car but it also helps you place it on the road a little bit better i'm not talking about getting the most out of a twisty b road i just mean being able to drive the car with a lot of confidence but that's coupled up with a really lovely and plush suspension system that means that yes the steering feels not necessarily sporty but you can be assertive with it but the rest of the car is relaxing this is designed to be a family car it's designed to go and do hundreds of miles in one sitting and you can do it in perfect comfort and it doesn't compromise the ride but i think the thing that surprised me the most so far about this f-pace is that we have the box standard diesel engine in this so you've only got 161 brake horsepower but i don't feel like i need anything faster really the only time where i might have wanted a bit more of a shove is pulling onto a motorway of where there's a very very short slip road but it's a really punchy engine and it's nice and frugal as well it's the sad side about the demonization of diesels because you get great mpg and also in the case of this jaguar the engine is super smooth and it just kind of shows you where jaguar has spent its money jaguar big on diesel and that's why it's found the downfall of diesels so hard you get in something like this and it's a really magnificent engine of course if you do want to future proof yourself there is now the plug-in hybrid i've not driven it but 33 miles of range on electric power alone is pretty damn good you're probably going to get closer to 25-26 miles in reality but let's say you've got a 10 mile commute to work you could go back and forth on electric power alone and only use the combustion engine for longer journeys now at the moment the big differentiator between the different f-pace trim levels is the kind of semi-autonomous driving modes so what we have kind of a standard even though this is the mid-spec s car is cruise control and you also have an adaptive speed limiter and traffic sign recognition so it knows if we're going from a 40 into a 30 it'll give me a little readout on the dashboard to tell me so there is a lane keep assistance as well but i find that it rarely cuts in when you need it to you can quite easily drift over the white lines and it won't put you back in your lane and you also have a collision warning system too it's really hard to actually think of things i'm not a big fan of when it comes to the way the f-pace drives i guess the gearbox can be a little bit confused at times i think also the build quality could be a little bit nicer the cabin now looks like it can rival german cars but the build quality just isn't quite there yet needs tightening up a little bit but other than that there's a lot to love about the f-pace it looks great it's quiet with this diesel on board you can get a hybrid if you want and best of all it's actually really enjoyable to drive [Music] not only does this f-pace feel like a giant leap forward compared to the pre-facelift car but it actually feels like a bit of a bargain because although its rivals feel like they're put together a little bit better the f-pace feels more luxurious and it's a lot of fun to drive so be sure to go head over to yesauto.co.uk to see if you can pick yourself up a deal on a new or nearly new jaguar f-pace [Music] you
66;Jaguar;2022 F-Pace;2022 Jaguar F Pace Review.. Trash or Treasure?;welcome to the 2022 jaguar f-pace p250 review meaning that this is the four-cylinder model and four-cylinder would have been fine if this thing didn't sticker for 68 000 the way that you see it uh optioned up here which is absolutely absurd we'll talk more about that later let's just first of all get this thing out on the road and see what it's all about talk about what's new talk about the exterior [Music] it's not a very quick machine at all that's not why you buy this or at least this engine anyway so this is 2022 not a whole lot of changes for this model year it's a carryover from 2021 that's when this vehicle got all the major updates and changes the visual changes up front the overall exterior got a little bit updated in 2021 and of course the pivi pro 11.4 inch touchscreen that they have here in the interior these were pretty much the major changes and of course the inline six which is turbocharged and supercharged with a 48 volt mild hybrid system that is the exact same engine i tried in my land rover defender review so i'm going to leave a link to that in the description box so you can check it out for this vehicle there are two inline six options basically you have a detuned version of the p400 which is what i tried in the defender but i'll talk about that during the drive right now let's talk about the exterior because that is something i've really come to appreciate with this f-pace i saw them on the road before but it wasn't until i got this as a test vehicle that i really start to appreciate it you know yeah this is absurdly expensive mainly because this has crazy 22-inch wheels which i definitely don't recommend anybody optioning on this f-pace because it ruins the ride quality and it also costs between three or four thousand dollars something crazy like that so definitely skip that upgrade the engine for that price but it's the wheels along with the with the black package on it that adds to the the look and the appeal of this vehicle i won't lie about that this almost has like a lamborghini urus that type of swagger to the exterior it's really quite impressive and people do certainly notice it it's a clean handsome design far superior in my opinion in terms of looks compared to like the bmw x3s the audi q5s which is what this competes with i specced out a p250s and it came out to be around 60 grand i also specced out the 335 horsepower inline six model that came out to be around 66 000 both overpriced this is one of the more pricey options in this category so keep that in mind but let's uh kind of come to a stop and let's transition over into this driving segment now that made pretty much no difference this vehicle with this engine is not happy doing high speeds that's not why you should be looking into this particular engine in fact the way i spec it out if you're really serious about getting this vehicle the six cylinder was six grand more you know if you're buying this vehicle you might as well go with that i wouldn't get the p 400 i don't think that's necessary but even when i was driving this out on the highway i can tell this is one of those engines where it loses steam on the top end it's not happy doing you know close to triple digit speeds in fact you know this is not going to pull anything past 100 miles an hour you're not going to get any real thrust or acceleration past that speed nor does that really matter in the united states but just so you know anything over 80 miles an hour i've noticed that the stability of this begins to get a little bit nervous it's not really too happy doing those speeds this particular vehicle the way you see it here it's about 4 000 pounds or so 4 100 pounds something like that the weight figure of this goes up significantly when you option up the larger engines and of course there is the svr model as well which is a totally different topic i spec that out and it was about 90 grand actually the jaguar fully loaded kind of performance models are actually a good value considering that you get over 500 horsepower and all but around town this engine is more than enough out in the highway just do under 80 miles an hour stick it in the in the right lane and you'll be happy with it you will be getting a little bit of that wind buffing effect at the 75 mile per hour speeds this does not utilize double pane glass i wish it would for a vehicle of this price category especially because this is the most expensive vehicle in its class or one of the most expensive vehicles in the class along with the porsche macan i want to see double ping glass being used but enough of that the handling of this is also extremely impressive for what this is because this blends together a good ride quality mixed with very decent handling characteristics and when i mention handling many people think i'm comparing this to like a porsche gt3 or something people are very obtuse and they take things way out of context but when i mean handling i mean when you take your casual left hand turns your right hand turns on everyday basis your occupants aren't being thrown around in the cabin space okay everybody's not being flopped around none of that is happening the vehicle remains neutral it remains planted there's enough confidence here there's enough resistance in the steering without it feeling overweighted or overly synthetic which is great which is that's exactly what i want so around town this is a cool vehicle to mob around in okay now keep in mind this vehicle has 22 inch wheels absolutely do not get these wheels not just because of the price but because it truly does ruin the ride quality because i can tell this has a good ride quality it's sprung pretty softly or there's a good balance between sport and softness here so they've done a good job with the suspension but these larger wheels when you go over the jittery bumps you really begin to feel it and that gets really annoying especially for a vehicle like this that's a pretty unrefined undignified experience when you get it with these 22 inch wheels the base wheels are 19 inches that's exactly what i would get you can pay like 150 bucks get them painted black even the silver 19 inch wheels look good on this you also have an option of 20s and 21s again stick to the 19s this would be a fantastic daily with that tire and wheel setup that being said the tire noise isn't ridiculous it's just the ride quality now there are some pretty big cons to this driving and that's mainly with the transmission i do not like the way this 8-speed transmission shifts at all it's very slow very sluggish nothing like the bmw zfs or the porsche pdks nothing along those lines this is the worst transmission performance amongst all the european vehicles easily amongst the x3 q5 and even the mercedes glc when you're at a stop when you're kind of moving like this and you step on it there's turbo lag there is transmission lag that's probably the most annoying thing about this vehicle now for most of the people buying this and the target demographic doing 15 miles an hour below the speed limit maybe it's not a big deal to you maybe you're just a jaguar freak and this is your dream car this is what you've always wanted i i'm impressed with this this has way more character than the european i'm sorry than the german counterparts i will give it that so okay fine i can maybe look over the transmission tuning and also the very stupid dynamic mode that this has which makes pretty much no difference at all when i switch it over into that mode in fact sometimes it even reacts even slower than in the comfort mode it's very strange very bizarre and also the animation for switching over into the dynamic mode is also flawed as well very laggy so i just put it into the comfort mode and just leave it alone because otherwise i really like the the drive mode selecting knob it's a button that you had to push up and then you can twist the dial it's very cool i like the way they do that type of stuff but don't waste your time with it reliability is one thing okay like people say a bmw isn't reliable or an audi isn't reliable well i don't really necessarily think those cars are going to leave you stranded on the side of the road those are just expensive cars to keep up with in the long term otherwise they're not bad cards they're not really unreliable they're just expensive to maintain but these things these land rover jaguar products the biggest problem with them is they just have random glitches and mishaps i'll give you an example i was backing this vehicle into my driveway and i put the vehicle into reverse it wouldn't go into reverse it just got stuck in in dry for a little bit very annoying i have no idea what happened there but it's it's these random glitches and the fact that this particular vehicle it's only got 1500 miles on it and already it's acting up like that the passenger seat it won't go forward or backwards that electronic mechanism doesn't work on this vehicle it'll go up and down and you can play with the recline but you can't push the seat forward or back very bizarre and that's just what 1500 miles so yeah okay i've been preaching on this channel get a warranty with any car okay this is part of the reason why because of stupid little issues like this and my middle name is practically warranty at this point because i preach it so many times and people think it's like blasphemy that i even mention it okay you can you can spend that warranty money on a crane and drop the engine and play with the car yourself if you want to waste your time i'd rather get the warranty get a get a cup of coffee at the dealership and a new loaner car that's what i would rather do it with my spare time okay if my vehicle does have any mishaps but the problems that these jlr products have it's a nuisance to everyday life it actually gets in your way in your everyday life and that's not what a vehicle should do to you right like you lease a bmw abandoned audi you know that's it's just gonna work for the first three years that you're leasing it that's not a problem but you lease this sure you're covered but you have to go through all these little headaches and that's what pisses me off about this brand otherwise i really like driving it i can even get over the stupid 8-speed transmission the ride was just fine especially if you got the 19-inch wheels i think this is a 0-60 in like 6.9 seconds and the 335 horsepower model does 0-16 around 5.8 seconds i think so it's a second faster and maybe with the added weight the stability might be a little bit better at the higher speeds with the six cylinder models so this actually had some character with its driving feel which is fine the brakes are decent and i even like this interior space as well in fact that's one of the biggest highlights with this vehicle so let's go ahead and let's transition over into this interior space [Music] okay talking about the interior now this has a gorgeous interior it's got the optional windsor windsor however you pronounce that uh optional quality leather here with the quilted stitching absolutely stunning definitely worth paying up for it that's why the four cylinder model that i specced out online came out to be around 60 grand because i had to get this leather definitely worth it and also this interior quality the way that it's put together it's actually solid it's very reminiscent of the land rover range rover products in the past the jaguar interiors really sucked it was nothing like the the land rover vehicles but now we actually have a well-crafted interior space so i'm very impressed with that i like this two-tone steering wheel it also feels great to grip onto we also have these meaty paddle shifters i i like how the vehicles that have the worst transmission performance gets the best paddle shifters and the vehicles actually have good transmissions they always get these stupid plastic paddle shifters very obnoxious but it is what it is these paddles are definitely something to behold they're fully made out of metal they're a good size they move with the steering wheel and the buttons the switch gear all that feels just fine one touch automatic windows for all four windows [Music] automatic headlights all the little safety tech in here surprisingly works okay the 11.4 inch pivot pro touch screen now that's kind of the biggest talk because actually a lot of people have had some glitches and some issues with this um infotainment system i actually haven't had any issues with it in fact i actually kind of like it it just has a bit of a learning curve but otherwise i genuinely do like this this infotainment you have the wireless apple carplay and android auto and i've always enjoyed the way jlr does the the climbing control i think it's really sleek very clean and it genuinely uses physical buttons well not really physical buttons in the center of it there's actually have to touch buttons right there but it almost feels like you're interacting with a physical button so i'm fine with that but i love the dials the way you pull them and push them to access the fan speeds the heated and cooled seats i will say the cooled seats don't really work too well but you do have them i would pay up the 900 to get the optional climate packages the hot and the cold climate packages i think that's definitely worth the money you have physical volume knob the 8-speed shifter is easy of course to use that's not a problem it just sometimes glitches up on me that's my only major problem with it and you have a wireless charging pad which doesn't seem to work maybe it's because of the chip shortage not not really sure you have two cup holders with this slot in the middle where you can actually have your phone standing up if that's what you want and you have some other additional space here as well in the center console but i will say the center armrest space is pathetic no real space there but you do have a usbc connectivity there i guess i like how when you press park the electronic parking brake automatically comes on that's a great feature i enjoy the driving position of this everything is easy to see except for the back window that kind of sucks however the the side mirrors do a great job so that's fine and it gives you that higher seating position that i think most people will want in the suv category the bmw x3 just feels like you're driving a sedan it does not feel raised up at all this the audi q5 the glc they do a good job of giving you that raised driving position uh makes you feel like you can see over other people so i think a lot of people are going to enjoy that the comfort of these seats are excellent they don't just look amazing but they are very comfortable to sit in obviously i'm having that issue with the passenger seat where it doesn't go forward and back you know classic jaguar issues the meridian surround sound system that you have to pay an extra 800 for definitely worth doing because the base hits really nice and it doesn't sacrifice the clarity either a great sound system this is a far better interior space than the jaguar f-type the f-type interior was total trash this mimics the land rover interiors that level of quality i do have one rattle coming from up here which is very annoying but maybe a dealership can fix that outside of that little rattle the interior is put together extremely well i also like the matte textured wood glove box space is pretty minimal as is the door pocket space something to keep in mind but this audio system definitely worth optioning sounds like garbage in the f-type sounds amazing in their suv products that's the thing this is the top best-selling vehicle that jaguar makes without this they'll probably go bankrupt so they don't screw around with this car they do their best job with it it gets the best updates the best interiors the best quality and the tech so that's good rear seats though complete joke i mean it's a joke in a lot of these european suvs i've noticed i think because there's a lot of structural bracing and things to make these vehicles drive well i think that's impeding in the interior space a little bit in the front seats it's okay and you also have this panoramic sunroof but the rear seats you're not really stretching out back there i'm five foot eleven getting in and out of this is pretty easy but you're not really stretching out the trunk space is okay that's not bad that should be more than enough for most families it's nothing crazy but it's okay you can of course put down the rear seats which certainly helps with the amount of space that you have to work with but overall this is a vehicle you should consider no i don't know if you like jaguars go for it i enjoy driving it it's a cool car to mob around town in but it's not perfect okay the transmission is a little annoying but most importantly i don't like the random glitches and issues that you have to deal with even if it is under warranty even if you are leasing it brand new those types of issues really pissed me off because six or eight years ago i've read that jaguar is trying to improve their reliability and they've totally not done that under sixty thousand dollars japanese cars are really the superior choice for around 60 you can get the new mdx that's kind of the way i would go you also have plug-in hybrid choices from lexus if you're willing to wait you can get the nx plug-in for around 57 grand and there's a 7 500 tax credit involved with that i just think the japanese vehicles give you the best bang for your buck very satisfactory driving experience for that type of money with a lot less headaches as well past 75 grand this is where i'm going to be looking into the macon s and the gle 450 bends these are kind of my top picks along with the bmw x5 plug-in hybrid that's something else to consider but again the good euro cars cost between 75 to 100 grand that's just the way it is so this is cool i guess get it if you love jaguars so i'm gonna leave it at that thanks again for watching take care and goodbye [Music] you
67;Jaguar;2022 F-Pace;NEW Jaguar F-Pace review  BIG changes but is it enough? | What Car?;the idea of jaguar making an suv was ridiculed by the brand itself a few decades ago but fast forward to today and the f-pace has played a significant role in the british brand's reinvention since its launch in 2016 the f-pace has been a rival to cars like the audi q5 the bmw x3 and also the volvo xc60 but the truth is that the f-pace has always been a bit off the pace with the best cars in its class that could be about to change that's because jaguar has given it a big refresh it gets a new interior different exterior styling and a revised engine lineup including the addition of this new plug-in hybrid model but are these changes enough to keep up with its rivals before we tell you make sure you're subscribed to our channel so you can see all of our other new car reviews as soon as they go live and if you've already decided that you want to buy a jaguar f-pace then you can save more than 1 600 pounds on one right now on whatcar.com just click on the link to go straight to all of the deals on our website so what's new well the f-pace has had a makeover inside and outside but the exterior upgrades like these slim led lights at the front and the rear the larger grille the slightly different bonnet are more subtle compared to the changes inside it really is very different in here now and all for the better as well as a fresh look the f-pace now benefits from a refreshed engine lineup as well so now it's got mild hybrid petrols and diesels along with this full plug-in hybrid let's take a closer look at this interior now and it really is so much better than it was before so now it's got a genuinely upmarket look and feel with really nice materials everywhere so you've got a nice mix of plush softly finished surfaces and depending on the trim level that you go for you can get really classy wood veneer finishes on this interior as well so this is now really a worthy alternative to the really nice interiors you get in the audi q5 and the bmw x3 and because of these updates it means that the f-pace's new interior is really at the sharp end of what this class has to offer thanks to its solid build and high quality feel and that definitely wasn't the case before something else new in here is this touch screen infotainment system so now every f-pace gets jaguar's latest pivot pro infotainment system so that's in this 11.4 inch touchscreen which has got a really simple layout it's got a configurable home screen and it's responsive it's easy to get your head around so this definitely as is the theme of this interior is a big step forward from what we had before you also still have physical dials to control the fan speed the temperature and the seat heating as well in terms of the other tech available in this interior you get analog dials as standard but you can upgrade to this fully digital driver display and it's really big clear easy to see and this generally is a comfortable place to sit as well it's very very simple getting your perfect driving position and there's loads of storage up front too so under this center armrest you've got a big cubby hole there's more storage on the center console you've got some wireless phone charging at the top here and even underneath the center console you've got some extra storage space too and the door bins are pretty big as well so all in all this new f-pace interior ticks quite a lot of boxes up front that it didn't take before the f-pace isn't the biggest large suv that you can buy so if you compare it to big proper seven-seaters like the kia sorento the land rover discovery sport then sure they offer more space in the rear seats and also they can get seven seats whereas the f-pace is a five-seater only but in the back this is still much more spacious than something like a porsche macan and you can see i'm just under six foot the driver's seat's in my driving position and really leg room there's plenty of it i can stretch out and relax it doesn't feel stingy in that regard at all in terms of headroom with the panoramic summary fitted if i sit up straight my head is just about brushing the roof lining here so it does feel a little bit cramped perhaps and if you're regularly going to be carrying adults in the back then you should be aware of the impact that adding a panoramic sunroof has on headroom in the back but otherwise this does feel like a comfortable and spacious interior for a family of four no problems at all at 650 liters the f paces boot is comparable with the x3 and the discovery sport so in total you can fit eight carry-on size suitcases into the boot which is decent if not quite a match for the q5 which can fit nine and that is a really practical boot in this class and for even more context compared to proper practicality first suvs like the kia sorento and the peugeot 5008 they can fit 10 carry-on size suitcases into the boot but those figures that we mentioned for the f-pace are for the regular petrol and diesel versions of this car this one here which is the plug-in hybrid isn't quite as practical so you can see you've got this slope up and this bulge under the boot floor here and that is because a lot of the hybrid stuff that this car needs lives under the boot floor back here and what that does is rob you of quite a chunk of extra space so in total you'll lose about two carry-on suitcases worth of space with the plug-in hybrid compared to the other regular versions of the f-pace and that is just something to bear in mind when it comes to deciding which version of the car you'd like [Music] every f-pace comes with all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic gearbox but there's quite a broad choice when it comes to the engines so there's a p400 there's a p250 but perhaps the most interesting choice in the lineup is the car that we're in now and it's the p400e which is a plug-in hybrid so it gets a two-liter petrol engine and an electric motor now it's quick but probably more important than that is the fact that this car can travel for up to 33 miles on pure electric power alone that's okay but it's not quite up there with the best new plug-in rivals that it's up against it's further than the 30 miles you get from an x3 but the lexus nx and volvo xc60 both offer more than 40 miles it's worth pointing out though that you won't actually be able to achieve those ranges in real-world driving expect them to be around 10 to 20 percent less than the quoted figure for any plug-in hybrid so overall while the p400e has an impressive hybrid setup it's just a shame the range isn't a bit more competitive with the best rivals out there but our favorite engine of the lot is actually the 201 brake horsepower 2 liter d200 it's punchy from low revs it's quick enough it's pretty smooth as well and it's more frugal than the regular petrols so it's a diesel not everyone is going to want it but to us it makes the most sense now if you're interested in the f-pace because of the kind of sporty characteristics that you think are on offer then it might not surprise you to find out that the ride is certainly a bit on the firm side so on the standard suspension setup around town particularly just feels a bit rigid and there's quite a lot of suspension noise as well so when you pass over lumps and bumps in the road there's a lot of thumps and thwacks that you can hear and that does become a bit annoying on long journeys but the ride does improve with speed although it is still true that an xc60 a q5 they both offer a smoother ride now in the f-pace you can go for a slightly more sophisticated adaptive suspension setup called adaptive dynamics but depending on the trim level you might have to pay extra for that and even with it fitted an xc60 a q5 quite a lot of other suvs still offer a smoother ride than what you get the f-pace is more than capable of tackling tricky terrain as well and every model comes with jaguar's drive control system as standard and that lets you choose between a few different settings like rain ice and snow but if you want your suv to power through bends more like a hot hatch on stilts rather than a proper old-school 4x4 then you'll love the f-pace because this is a really good thing to drive the way it flows through bends is properly impressive for what is essentially a pretty big suv and in fact there aren't really many other suvs at all that are better to drive the f-pace is priced there or thereabouts with most of its premium rivals but it does stand out because of its fantastic resale values which should mean good pcp finance deals every f-pace is well equipped too so should you buy one well if you're looking for a comfy and practical family car then it's fair to say there are other suvs that are more spacious and offer a smoother ride but for pure driver satisfaction and for this smart high-grade interior the f-pace does stand out from its rivals if you've decided that the f-pace is the car for you then you can get a 1600 pound saving on one right now on whatcar.com just click on the link at the top of the screen to go straight to that deal and on our website you can also see all the other savings we've got on every other new car around but before you go anywhere else make sure you're subscribed to our channel so you can see all of our new car reviews as soon as they go live if you've enjoyed this review or you found it helpful it'd be great if you gave it a like and tell us in the comments below what do you think of the new f-pace [Music] [Music] you
68;Jaguar;2022 F-Pace;Jaguar F-PACE 2022 UK Review - Best Sports SUV?;jaguar's f-pace has always bought a well-judged compromise of class performance and capability to the luxury mid-sized suv segment this much improved version further enhances its proposition with mild hybrid engine electrification plus a plug-in model along with more sophisticated media connectivity and a far smarter cabin it's now the car it always should have been and if you're shopping in the segment for mid-sized premium badge suvs it offers a refreshing arguably more dynamic and very jaguar-like alternative to key rivals [Music] if there's one type of car that epitomizes this period in motoring history it's the suv so many buyers desire them and jaguar wants a slice of this action as a result back in 2015 the british company brought us its first ever model of this kind the f pace complete with high riding driving position four wheel drive and even some moderate off-road ability five years on it was updated to create the car we're going to look at here why it took jaguar so long to enter a segment that now dominates its sales is a difficult question to answer there was never the investment to create such a thing until indian conglomerate tata took over control in 2008 and afterwards given jaguar's close partnership with land rover there was a management disinclination for the two marks to cross into each other's territory but it was thinking that had to change at the same time around the time of this model's original launch jaguar's engineers were grappling with the challenge of all electric engineering eventually responded to with another similar sized suv the battery-powered i-pace launched in 2018 which has since gone on to become one of the company's best-selling models safe in the knowledge that mixing the suv genre with electrification would hit the sales sweet spot jaguar then combined the two in late 2020 to create the hugely improved f-pace model we're testing here obviously the existence of the i-pace means there's no need for a full battery ev version of this car the f-pace's sophisticated aluminium chassis doesn't allow for that anyway but you can now have a phev plug-in hybrid variant the p400e derivative we have here with an ev range of 33 miles the more affordable diesel combustion variants that most f-pace customers will continue to choose get a lesser sprinkling of electrification courtesy of an mhev mild hybrid system and if you really don't care about the polar ice cap and only prioritize performance in an suv of this type you'll be pleased to hear that the wild v8 petrol powered svr model continues on at the top of the range away from engines the cabin's been completely redesigned around a cutting-edge pivi pro infotainment system there's also a smarter exterior look and sophisticated safety so has all of this revitalized the f-pace sales perspective proposition in the face of tough rivals also recently refreshed cars like the audi q5 the mercedes glc and the bmw x3 well you'll need the industry's most comprehensive review the car and driving road test to find out [Music] virtually all suv makers will tell you that their cars are luxurious sporty and capable usually though the truth is that the model in question especially emphasizes one particular attribute often to the detriment of others take the midsize luxury segment of this market a porsche macan is great to drive but pretty limited off-road a mercedes glc feels luxurious but isn't especially rewarding at the wheel and a land rover discovery sport will take on the wilderness but won't make you feel special and costed when you take a seat inside can a better compromise between all these virtues really be reached well this jaguar f-pace has always claimed to offer it when jaguar makes that claim you tend to sit up and take notice after all the brand knows a thing or two about ride and handling and its land rover connections have given it plenty of understanding on the subject of four-wheel drive too plus of course the company has had an awful long time to stand back and look at the market then come up with something better this f-pace does after all date back only as far as 2017. if you've not tried one before on paper it looks as if it might be rather good the low slung looks matched by equally sophisticated aluminium underpinnings unlike the smaller e-pace this isn't a jaguar body slung on top of a land rover's running gear instead the f-pace uses the iqal chassis from the company's much-admired xc and xf saloons architecture lightly updated here to accommodate this revised model's more electrified engine range which as before drives through a smooth shifting zf 8-speed auto gearbox a few other little detail engineering changes feature here segment first active road noise cancellation technology further improves the already impressive refinement and there's a new auto vehicle hold system to make pulling away from uphill junctions a bit less of a faff but with this revised f-pace the big story is what now lies beneath the bonnet mild hybrid tech to embellish all of the diesel engines and one of the petrol units too plus there's also the introduction of the plug-in hybrid p400e phev model we're trying here we'll start with the mild hybrid model since those are going to be the most popular this mhev tech is applied to jaguar's two liter ingenium diesel engines offered in d165 and d200 forms the figures designating engine output and it also features on the two six cylinder variants the d300 diesel and the p400 petrol in every case of course the concept is the same a belt integrated starter generator harvests energy usually lost when slowing or breaking that energy is then stored in a little 48 volt lithium ion battery secreted beneath the rear seat before being intelligently redeployed to assist the powertrain when accelerating away and delivering a more refined engine stop start system don't get your hopes up too high when it comes to the efficiency running cost difference the mhev system will make but you should notice a bit more zip away from rest courtesy of that extra harvested energy and sure enough you do you'd have to be on a bit of a budget to choose an f-pace with the base d-165 diesel 163 ps isn't a huge amount to propel along an suv weighing nearly two tons and in this form it certainly feels slower than the performance figures rest to 60 in 9.2 seconds on route to 121 miles an hour would suggest courtesy of a torque boost from 380 to 430 newton meters the mid-range d200 diesel is far more satisfying the performance figures improve to 7.6 seconds and 130 miles an hour if you use the transmissions quicker responding s setting or take control with the lovely zinc alloy shifter paddles and the d200 is of course far better suited to the towing duties that some owners may have in mind unless you'll be plugging your f-pace in it'll come with a useful braked towing limit of two thousand four hundred kilos a six cylinder d300 diesel would of course be even better here torque output skyrockets to 650 newton meters and the performance stats jump to 6.1 seconds and 143 miles an hour but if performance is your priority in choosing an f-pace you choose one of the petrol models probably not the base p250 the only mainstream variant that does without mild hybrid embellishment though in that form this suv is more than acceptably rapid making 60 miles an hour in 6.9 seconds on the way to 135 miles an hour better if you can afford it is the properly powerful p400 whose i6 6-cylinder engine is an mhev which storms to 60 miles an hour in 5.1 seconds to the accompaniment of a rather evocative growl on the way to 155 miles an hour potential porsche macan buyers will love it there's no real need to go faster than that in a car of this kind but if you want to anyway the wild p550 svr variant awaits at the top of the range with its five-liter v8 supercharged engine that'll howl its way to the 60-mile benchmark in just 3.8 seconds and on an autobahn or on the hanger straight at silverstone keep accelerating until you reach miles an hour one for the very brave perhaps all of these engines are fundamentally familiar from before and there's even plenty of carryover with this revised model lineups one completely fresh powertrain the plug-in hybrid setup featuring in the p400e variant that as mentioned earlier we've chosen to test today at the heart of this phev model's engine bay you will after all find jaguar's usual 2-liter petrol ingenium turbo unit here though it's been coupled with a 143 ps electric motor powered by a rear-mounted 17.1 kilowatt-hour battery that when fully charged can facilitate a 33-mile all-electric driving range and if you wanted to take the car up to 87 miles an hour without burning fossil fuel for that you'd need to keep the drivetrain in its ev setting one of three provided phev modes the other two are hybrid and save the total power output this combination generates 404 ps is a fair slug more than you'll get from obvious bmw and audi rivals in this segment but unfortunately this p400e is portly await i think around 2.2 tonnes cancels out any potential performance benefit mind you this four cylinder plug-in f-pace still manages to go a little faster than its six-cylinder conventional p-400 counterpart making 60 miles an hour in five seconds dead though weighing half as much as an asian elephant fractionally restricts this phev variance top speed to 149 miles an hour that weight is something you very definitely feel if you're in a p400e and throw it through a series of tight twisty corners in the way a likely owner rarely would which is a pity because it rather robs this car of the fluid rather agile and mildly engaging drive dynamics that always marked it out from its german rivals fortunately that demeanor's remained intact in the commoner more affordable variants which can make better use of the suspension arrangement borrowed from those jaguar saloons we mentioned earlier with double wishbones at the front and a multi-link rear axle a setup you can optionally embellish with jaguar's usual adaptive dynamics adaptive damping system it's standard on this phev yes through the turns in a conventional diesel or petrol model there's a touch more body roll than you'd get in an xe or an xf and yes the electric steering is a fraction less feelsome than an enthusiastic driver might ideally like but neither of these things significantly affect the way that you can hustle mainstream versions of this car through any given bend progressing in a manner that simply wouldn't be possible in most other suvs of course there are reasons for this that go beyond springs and dampers there's the kind of torque vectoring system you get on performance coupes that through tight turns transfers traction to the wheel that can make best use of it plus when jaguar says this car's now mandatory all-wheel drive system was originally developed on the track it means silverstone not the serengeti it's the defiantly rear biased system first seen on the company's f-type sports car one that never diverts more than fifty percent of its power up front a process that happens in milliseconds as soon as the first signs of wheel slip are detected another key tool in the f-pace's armory is jaguar drive control one of those setups that allows you to alter throttle response steering feel and auto gear shift change timings dependent on the way you want to drive simply make your choice between the various modes provided by this now restyled pop-up mode controller next to the stitched gear selector comfort and eco are fairly self-explanatory while dynamic sharpens up the car nicely to the accompaniment of a red tinged instrument display there's also an extra rain ice and snow option that activates all surface progress control a speed cruise control that helps maintain progress and avoid wheel spin on low traction surfaces you power away from using a low traction launch system if your car has jaguar's configurable dynamics package as it will have if adaptive damping has been fitted you'd also get this dynamic eye screen that allows you to input your own specific dynamic or comfort settings for engine steering gear shift and suspension plus there's a stopwatch a lap timer and a g meter to underline the brand's insistence that this is indeed the sports car of suvs having configurable dynamics also allows you to order jaguar's terrain response technology its adsr or adaptive surface response setup which works alongside the all-wheel drive system in challenging conditions adsr alters its response according to the surface to maximize grip for instance when moving from tarmac to wet grass friction levels are automatically sensed and the car's throttle response adapted to stop the wheels from spinning it's like having an expert sitting alongside you making constant changes to suit the terrain adsr was developed at the challenging land rover east north off-road test track which we can tell you from personal experience includes rutted trails you simply couldn't even consider attempting in one of this car's german rivals not if you wanted to avoid a trip to the body shop anyway that an f-pace can cope here has a lot to do with its four-wheel drive systems integrated idd or intelligent driveline dynamics control system which when you're off-piste is continuously estimating not only the friction between the tyres and the surface but also how much of the available grip is being exploited at each wheel hill launch assist further helps here as does the kind of properly elevated ground clearance that's so often lacking in more dynamically orientated luxury suvs this jaguar sits a decent millimeters off the ground one reason why it can wade through water up to 525 millimeters deep and coat with maximum approach and departure angles of 25.5 and 26 degrees respectively it's yet another thing you simply wouldn't expect this car to be able to do what you'll need it to be able to do of course is cruise with luxury saloon style refinements as all variants do and to be able to smooth away the tarmac tears of the skull run again an f-pace speciality you'll also want this car to relax you on highway journeys which this jaguar will do more easily when fitted with the brand's optional adaptive cruise control with steering assist system which takes care of most steering braking and throttle duties for you providing your hands stay on the steering wheel it works in urban traffic too so an f-pace works just about everywhere from farm trails to the frantic morning commute it certainly isn't perfect especially in this expensive plug-in form but you might well think it's closer to being the perfect compromise in this segment than any other rival [Music] it says much that jaguar likes to market this f-pace as the sports car of suvs the stylish shape remains pretty much exactly what we saw from the coventry company cx-17 prototype a car unveiled back in 2013 at the frankfurt motor show in production form the lines turned out to be just as eye-catching chief stylist ian callum refusing to be constrained by the suv sector's usual aesthetic design cues instead delivering a much more dynamic silhouette with a roofline lower and closer to the road than anything else in the segment and not much has changed with this package of exterior updates or at least you might think that until you take a closer look so let's do that and start up front now there's a sculpted new bonnet with a wider power bulge that bonnet extending flush to the very top of the grille surround eliminating the rather ugly shot line that previously ran across the nose it flows into a larger completely redesigned heritage inspired monogrammed mesh grille with diamond detailing and a classic jaguar growler badge flanking this appendage are redesigned all led quad headlights that are 10 millimeters slimmer than before and these further up the range featuring double j daytime running light graphics and animated directional indicators the upper and lower bumper sections have also been restyled as have these corner intakes now as before most models will be sold in the r-dynamic form we have here distinguished from the standard variants by a cleaner more open design for these huge corner intakes and a black finish for the grille there are fewer changes in profile though these side vents do now feature the iconic jaguar leaper big wheels are an intrinsic part of this design the smallest rooms you can now get across most of the range are 19 inches in size and you can go all the way up to the big 21 inch alloys we have here otherwise the silhouettes familiar from before jaguar's design team has done everything possible to break up and disguise the height of this suv hence this slash in the body work along the bottom of the doors under which runs this slim angled silver strip there's a powerfully strong shoulder line too while this line that runs from the wing vent into the front door is another neat touch at the rear the taillights originally inspired by the f-type sports car now have more in common with the i-pace ev featuring jaguar's chicane illuminating graphic you might not pick up on the fact that the tailgate is completely new but an existing owner would be more likely to notice the redesigned lower bumper of course as usual what's more important is the stuff you can't see around 80 percent of the body is fashioned from lightweight aluminium and some of it the cross chassis rail for example even uses high-tech magnesium so subtle evolution outside will the same be true of the cabin actually no unusually for a mid-term facelift almost everything here has been fundamentally redesigned and is all the better for it the focal point is this new and much more sophisticated larger pve pro central touchscreen but there's also much else to catch the eye in an interior that feels very jaguar with an ambience completely different to that you'll find in german rivals there's lots to take in if you happen to be used to the original model things like the sleeker vents the dished three spoke wheel and the more tactile gear lever replacing the rising rotary dial used before surrounding it all authentic finishes feature in beautifully formed shapes reinvigorating jaguar's rich lineage of luxury interiors this smarter center console has been redesigned too sweeping up to meet the center stack where a piano black panel houses classier climate dials embellished with a jaguar coventry established in 1935 motif lovely the metal finishing you get here around the gear stick on the steering wheel and along the door pulls really feels like metal which isn't the case with rivals like the mercedes glc and twin lines of double stitching decorate the dash and the door cards before continuing down both sides of the restyled lower console jaguar wants a lot of money for this car but you can see where it's been spent the whole cabin ambience is designed to make anyone coming to this car fresh from one of the company's saloons to feel instantly at home and as before the so-called sports command driving position delivers the kind of high set authoritative seating placement that suv drivers like so much without perching you so far up that you lose the feel of being an integral part of the whole experience it's a very well judged compromise positioning you perfectly for the kind of involving drive promised by the sports car marketing rhetoric we remember that from the original version of this car but we also remember the rather clunky in control infotainment screen setup which didn't even have the apple carplay or android auto smartphone mirroring tech that's long been a norm in this segment but forget all of that now because this improved models replacement pv pro system is one of the very best setups in its sector its touchscreen elegantly curved to match the instrument panel's profile 11.4 inches in size and encased in the black satin finished magnesium frame it's so much easier to use than the previous smaller in control setup allowing the driver to carry out 90 of common tasks within two taps from the touchscreen thanks to the simplified menu structure basically what's on offer here is a whole fresh generation of infotainment powered by dual sim technology with two lte modems enabling the software to carry out multiple functions at the same time such as streaming media or downloading software over the air updates that will enable the system to continually update itself previous owners will immediately notice how much quicker everything is thanks to a built-in backup battery initialization for the 3d navigation system takes just seconds 4g wi-fi connectivity is optional but if you have it up to eight devices around the car can be connected so your rear passengers will be grateful this right hand menu bar gives you quick access to this monitor's major sections nav media audio and a final icons option that connects you to a display that collects together everything else you might want to peruse as usual with these kinds of systems there's a split main home screen that prioritizes the things you'll need most frequently probably nav phone and media as here and jaguar has made up for its tardiness in offering apple carplay and android auto by making both elements available with the option of more convenient wireless connectivity we are disappointed though to find that the incorporated voice control functionality here is nothing like as intuitive as that you'll find on german rivals still there's a standard rear view camera and a lot of detail buried in the icons section a dynamic eye drive settings screen tractional options like all surface information and load traction launch an eco data segment info on parking and a very informative weather menu that briefs you on climate instantly hourly or five days ahead just about anything else you might need to know can be found in the instrument binnacle and you'll be particularly well served if you paid the extra for a plusher model with this interactive driver display instrument binning screen or stump up more to get it fitted in place with the usual conventional analog dials this 12.3 inch tft monitor standard with this phev variant and controlled not particularly intuitively by this new steering wheels rather cheap feeling hidden until lit switches is pretty much as customizable as the best instrument screens you'll find with rivals if you don't want this conventional 2 dial layout you can prioritize a single dial or have the screen focus entirely on mapping media or driver assistance graphics info panels to the left and right of the display can be configured with trip summary and media info or you can add a driver assistance graphic on the left or mapping on to the right plus a press of the end of the left steering column stalk varies this small lower readout between trip average speed average or instant fuel consumption and driving range info enough on media what else might you need to know here oh we've talked about the greater feeling of luxury inherent in this dash design helped by the fact that it's no longer simply lifted from the xe saloon lovely touches are plentiful the lovely cool zinc alloy gear shift paddles the cricket ball style stitching on the gear lever the split rim steering wheel the knurled metallic rotary dials the touch sensitive overhead lights an ignition button that pulses red prior to startup and if you opt for the meridian audio system upgrade these brushed metal laser etched lacquered silver speaker frets little ergonomic touches have been addressed too like the way that the electric window switches have now been repositioned from the top of the door roll to the armrest putting them within easier reach we particularly like the seats which are the figure-hugging sports variety with the r dynamic trimmed models that most will want on almost all variants they're leather trimmed of course as standard and even entry level spec allows for lumbar support heating and eight-way part electric adjustment for this updated model these front chairs have been revised with wider cushioning optional front massage settings and larger heating and cooling areas for greater comfort a fresh interior lighting design also adds to the premium effect with 10 selectable colors an upper strip of light encircling the front of the cabin and a lower lighting zone that uses a softer waterfall effect plus jaguar has introduced a sophisticated cabin air ionization system we have it here with a pm 2.5 filter which features a filtration system capable of capturing ultra fine particles you activate it via a purify option on the climate screen overall then there's much to like and little to criticize though we still do have a few small issues the standard 125 watt sound system audio setup isn't particularly impressive presumably to encourage you towards the meridian upgrade the electric seat control still feel a little flimsy and as before rear visibility isn't especially good mainly due to the raked back rear screen but also hampered by the rising door line and narrow rear quarter windows so it's just as well that a rear view camera and all-round sensors are standard storage space provision has improved though and this redesigned lower console now conceals away the cup holders with a sliding lid covering an area that also provides a small storage compartment along with a 12 volt socket though when was the last time you actually used a 12 volt socket jaguar seems to have a thing about them because another 12 volt socket features within this lidded box between the seats though fortunately here you also get more useful usb ports gratifyingly of both the usb-a as well as the usb-c sort so you don't have to have the ugly converter leads necessary with german rivals this console around the gear lever has been redesigned in its lower as well as its upper section there's now a see-through open aperture here at the bottom framed by metallic hoops that's intended for small augment storage though it's so shallow that items placed here might be in danger of spilling out into the foot wells during spirited cornering plus you also get a big glove box with a pen clip an elasticated strap decently sized door bins ticket clips in the sun visors and the kind of overhead compartment for sunglasses that usually gets emitted where provisions made for the option of a big panoramic glass roof as you can see here though on an f-pace you can have both curiously jaguar forces f-pace customers of every trim grade to pay extra for the kind of wireless charging map that nearly every executive needs these days it sits in this open compartment at the base of the center stack time to take a seat in the rear now as in the front the doors open wide which means it'll be easy to reach in and fit something like a child seat and as you get in also as in the front you slide onto the seat rather than clamber up into it as would be the case with some other suvs once installed two tall adults get more headroom than you might expect the raked back roof line to be able to provide and there's reasonable standards of knee room too certainly more than you get with competitors like bmw's x3 and porsche's mccann as with those rivals the cabin will feel pretty cramped if you have to fit in a third occupant thanks primarily to this high center transmission tunnel there's a central armrest with twin cup holders plus a center console with vents a cubby and yet another 12 volt socket you'll have to pay extra for the usb points you'll need to keep the kids quiet with their games on longer journeys this rear bench can't slide as it would on some rivals but you can specify an optional power reclining seat back there are netted seat back pockets overhead led reading lights coat hooks in the grab handles and reasonably sized door bins in the lovely double stitched silver trimmed door cards these little rear quarter windows let in much needed light and the cabin back here will feel particularly airy if you've stretched to a model with this huge panoramic glass roof though it does slightly reduce headroom now let's have a look at the boot accessed on almost all models via this powered tailgate that can feature gesture control useful if you happen to be approaching your f-pace laden down with bags and want to open the rear hatch with a swipe of your foot beneath the bumper now it rises to reveal one of the larger luggage compartments in the mid-sized suv segment the dry load space capacity for mainstream models rated at 601 liters enough for up to eight carry-on suitcases as you might be able to tell from this curiously sloped entry section to the load bay floor of this plug-in hybrid variant we haven't got anything like that here thanks to the battery pack which must lie beneath the base of the cargo area dry capacity in this case falls to 485 litres and as you can see you're heavily compromised in terms of under floor space too annoyingly the little compartment you do get under here isn't big enough to stash the charging lead above deck though even with this p400e variant a set of golf clubs or a child buggy will easily fit across the range the cargo areas accessed across this rather impractical metal covered loading lip which will quickly scratch and scuff but it's usably shaped too and quite long measuring 1018 millimeters up to the rear seat backs as well as the usual tie downs and bag hooks jaguar also supplies four of these little metal catches to help secure items and of course you can specify the usual optional nets and rails if you want to go further now it's a pity this right hand side fuse box lid isn't better secured but there's a netted area on the left and led lights on either side plus the rear bench is split in a flexible 40 20 40 formation so you can slide longer items like skis in between a couple of rear seated passengers those needing more space will be irritated to find that jaguar still insists on charging an insignificant amount extra for catches to push forward the rear bench we don't have them here without them you have to go round to the side doors and use the catches in the seats with all three rear seat segment portions dropped down the floor isn't quite flat but the 1428 liter dry cargo capacity provided is reasonably sized for this class of car that falls to 1299 litres for this plug-in variant [Music] given the rival models jaguar hopes to target in the mid-size premium suv market the f-pace's pricing is relatively predictable the mainstream range starting at around forty thousand pounds and extending up towards the sixty thousand pound mark trim levels vary depending on the engine you choose but the core ones you'll mostly be offered are base spec then r dynamic s and an r dynamic se variant also available in our dynamic black form our dynamic hse gets you all the bells and whistles whatever your choice bear in mind that the all-wheel drive system and automatic gearbox that customers in this segment now expect are included as standard even at the very bottom of the range take that into account and if you were to look back to the prices being charged at this f-pace model's original launch you'd find that they haven't actually risen all that much which is refreshing especially given the way that the car itself is now so much better for a start all the mainstream diesel variants the models that most customers are likely to choose now feature the company's latest mhev mild hybrid engine tech the majority will be choosing between the two least powerful variants the d165 and the d200 there's a premium of around two thousand pounds to go from one to the other now it's hard to understand why jaguar feels the need to charge so much more for its base petrol variant the four-cylinder p250 model priced from launch at around 48 000 pounds particularly as this derivatives engine is the only one in the range lacking the mhev technology from there around 55 000 pounds is the next pricing milestone the sum that allows you to choose either the six cylinder d300 mhev diesel or more likely the four-cylinder p400e phev petrol plug-in hybrid we're trying here for those prioritizing performance rather than efficiency there's the choice of two top petrol variants the six cylinder p 400 and the wild v8 5 liter 550 ps svr as we move on to the value proposition the f-pace pricing represents it's worth pointing out that there's only one f-pace body style this model's three german arch rivals bmw's x3 audi's q5 and the mercedes glc can also be ordered with sportier sweat back body shells respectively in x4 q5 sportback and glc coupe forms but let's get on to this jaguar's value proposition which will base around the volume d200 
69;Jaguar;2022 F-Pace;Jaguar has fixed the BIGGEST problem with the F-Pace: review;the Jaguar f-pace has so much potential I mean in some ways it's one of the very best mid-size SUVs that you can buy but there was one thing holding it back something that we couldn't ignore here at Auto Express well guess what Jackie I've only gone and fixed it and the results are in and they're blooming good [Music] I'll explain why in a minute but first let's look at that handsome face the high shoulder line the F-type esque rear lights it's all very Suave and that's because this f-pace is the face lifted model that arrived towards the end of 2020 which also brought new electrified powertrains right so what we've got here is the p400e which is the plug-in hybrid so it's got a two liter four-cylinder petrol engine that gives 296 brake horsepower which for a lot of people will be plenty but no on top of that you also have the electric motor so that combined gives 398 brake horsepower so yes Punchy yes nippy yes it's got 620 newton meters of torque you really feel like you don't have to work this engine hard to get it to go and it kind of suits the car's personality I do want to point something out to you when you put it into Dynamic mode there we go turns everything red stunning it plays like a fake V8 noise through the speakers which I'm not too sure about unless let's see oh yeah go on okay okay all right fine the fake V8 actually sounded quite cool when I put my foot down just then okay fine I will accept the fake V8 but wait being a plug-in hybrid what really matters is the electric element to the powertrain so what's it like when you switch to EV mode this is easily the most relaxing f-pace that you can buy when it's in electric mode it can stay in electric mode for up to 87 miles an hour and it can do that for 33 miles and it's super Serene and super quiet when it does it too oh and you can charge this at a rapid charger so you can get up to 80 in like half an hour it is worth pointing out though this car is easily over two tons so when it is in electric mode and you're building up speed you can feel it struggle a little bit so then the combustion engine kind of kicks in and helps it along the way oh and also you won't be getting the 130 miles per gallon that they're claiming no that's not going to happen maybe in the 50s 60s if you're lucky not 130. this gearbox though this automatic gearbox is super smooth super smooth I like that very much not too shabby then but one of the best bits about the f-pace is the way it drives it's right up there with the class leaders right let's be honest no one's going to be buying an f-pay so they can whiz it around on B roads but that doesn't mean that you can't enjoy how well sorted this chassis feels I mean the grip on this thing and the body control is really really impressive the steering has a nice bit of weight to it but it feels quite natural at the same time I mean there's been no sacrifice when it comes to comfort or refinement you know when sometimes you're driving a car and then you hit a bump in the road and it goes there's no gagong here it hits a bump and goes flim flum Flume that's how it hits the Buns flumpflum flum however you want to spell it the f-pace really is one of the best handling SUVs of the lot but to be honest it always has been where it has traditionally lagged behind its Rivals though is the interior the f-pace launched where they clunky old infotainment and a cheap looking dashboard that really didn't do the rest of the card justice but just look at what they've done with the facelift right interior this is probably the biggest revamp that we have ever seen on a facelifted car it's like we're sat in a completely different car new steering wheel new Dash new center console I mean it's stunning it's quite stylish isn't it I like the word plush for it's very plush very plush I like the stitching on the gear lever because I think it looks a little bit like a cricket ball like if used to make this red it would be like a cricket ball the screen 11.4 inches with I don't I don't know if you can see it but it's got a really subtle curve to it and it runs the same software as what's in the new Range Rover so yes very very good the graphics are really stylish very classy I think and it's super intuitive I mean look at this there's no lag there whatsoever Apple carplay Android auto so much better than the old system 12.3 inch digital instrument cluster that's nice and easy to follow Meridian Hi-Fi which sounds gorgeous when everything's all turned up really loud and you're having a good Singh song in the car which for me has likely been to Abba lovely uh even though it is packed full of tech they haven't forgotten the important stuff like twisty climate controls stunning oh beautiful okay so the interior has taken a giant leap forward and it's just as spacious as before that means there is much more space in the back than you get in a Porsche Macan right while I've got your attention if you go for the regular f-pace then you get a whopping 650 liter boot but if you go for the plug-in hybrid then you lose like a hundred liters 552 liters well actually minus what three liters because there's nowhere else to put your charging cables and I really want to point out the weird shape of it because if you put awkward items in here I guarantee you by the end of your journey they're going to fall and end up down here and then you're going to open the boot and however they're going to fall out or you're going to open the boot and then you're going to have to kind of stop things it's just a little irritant apart from that I love it
70;Jaguar;2022 F-Pace;2022 Jaguar F Pace (Facelift) Review;so welcome back to the channel guys today we've got Old Faithful RF pace and we've been lucky enough to have been loans the new shape f-pace by harwoods in Chichester So today we're going to compare the two and see how they stack up against each other I need to get down off of here without hurting myself and take this out for a test drive [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] thank you so what we've got here today is the two liter diesel mild hybrid 2022 f-pace it's the r sport variant the askbook denotes the trim level and being a mild hybrid this has a battery assist that does things such as healthy fuel economy and give you a little bit more performance this is probably a middle of the range in terms of spec and it's wrapped in this gorgeous blue which I'm going to be honest I need to look up what blue this is and I'll pop it down the bottom of the screen there so first of all let's talk about the exterior of the car Jaguar have done a lot of subtle yet very very noticeable changes to the outside of this car that in my opinion just makes it look so much more modern than its predecessor the front grille and the Bonnet has been totally redesigned this now comes further down whereas before it stopped up here and met with the front bumper this gives you a much bigger Grille with a more modernistic or modernized looking effect to The Grille here and a bigger Jaguar badge in the center although less not spend too long looking at that panel Gap there shall we the side vents have had a minor revamp bringing them in line with the same style that's offered on the new F-TYPE and the keynote amongst you will notice there's no exhaust cutouts until you get to the three liter v6 or the svr variant and something that makes a huge difference in my opinion is they now offer black badges with the black pack that comes on the car so you get the the f-pace the Jaguar badges in Black as well as the black window surrounds wheels and the tints to the windows on our car the pre-facelift version even though it had the black pack these were still silver and in my opinion it just it's just weird it doesn't look right so well done Jaguar that looks great so as far as the exterior is concerned that's about all that is different with this but when you get inside wow is it a different Beast altogether let's jump in and have a look wow that this is Worlds Apart I'm I'm actually thinking I've made a mistake in borrowing this I don't know if I'm going to want to get back in my car this is an absolute step change from the pre-facelift I'm sitting in here trying to take it all in this is worlds apart from its predecessor if it didn't have Jaguar written around the interior in some really quite tasteful places I think I'm inside a Range Rover at this point there's a lot to talk about in here so I'm going to do a little bit of a video montage now showing you how different this interior really is and then we'll dive into what that actually means foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] all in all I think the new interior is such a revolutionary change for the f-pace it really has modernized it beautifully it's got rid of some of that aged infotainment system in favor of some more modern tech and as I said if it wasn't for those Jaguar bits and pieces around the cabin I would genuinely think I'm inside a Range Rover and that's really apparent in what Jaguar are trying to do they're not borrowing Parts out of the jlr family from Land Rover and putting them in their f-pace which is their Flagship 4x4 they're borrowing Parts out of the Range Rover and that really shines through in the quality of the interior and the overall experience this is a very nice place to be I think I've shot myself in the fur in having to go back to my pre-facelift I think this video might have cost me an awful lot of money but it's not all sunshine and rainbows there are a few bits in here where I think they've probably just let themselves down ever so slightly take a look at this I'm hoping the microphone will pick up on this doesn't sound great does it same goes for down here it is padded plastic it's not just hard plastic but it's not great this is just a personal preference thing but there's no sunglasses holder I don't really know what that is but there's nowhere to put your sunglasses anymore and again those who watch the channel regularly will know I do like a pair of sunglasses and they've done away with the suede cloth headlining in favor of just a black fabric which whilst yes it's soft and it's it's quite nice it's nowhere near as good as that suede cloth in the in the previous the pre-facelift we still have this gorgeous panoramic roof letting in a lot of light with an electronic sun shade that you can pull over so in terms of spec in this car we've got the heated steering wheel very important at this time of year as you saw earlier on in the video we've also got adaptive cruise which sits behind that emblem we were looking at earlier hence the sort of domed plastic effect to it Lane keep assist speed limiter and I think perhaps my favorite bit is the wireless charger that they finally put down here any of you who watch my channel regularly will know I've recently just fitted a wireless charger to RF Pace the pre-face lift which as far as I know wasn't an option but that comes down there now in the new shape and the carplay is Wireless itself and this screen has got such a good resolution on it let me pop it in reverse it's like reversing in 4k it's nuts The Clarity on that is Bonkers it really puts the pre-face to shame and the parking sensors are a lot more responsive a lot more fit for purpose we've also got heated windscreen and heated seats there is an option you can put cooled seats in you'd see that filling up blue the same as this one fills up red but this this car doesn't have that this is just an Arsenal four quart filler and if Wireless carplay isn't your thing you can still go old school so with all that said and done let's take this out for a drive and see what it's like on the road [Music] [Music] [Music] so let's talk about the drive the first thing you're struck by when you get into this car and you start doing any sort of speed it's just how quiet it is it it's phenomenal it's night and day compared to the the preface I don't know if it's the tires the suspension the way they've insulated the body I don't know but this is quiet the second thing you're struck by is just how responsive the gearbox is and also how quick the start stop technology is in this because of that mild hybrid action it's one thing that really bugs me in the pre-face that we own is the start stop you always have to turn it off when you get into the car if you don't want it on it doesn't stay off and it can be quite slow when you pull up to a junction if the start stop kicks in the engine turns off you're there you want to pull out and there's a lag of about a second maybe a second and a half before anything actually happens in this it's instantaneous you don't have a conventional starter motor per se but you have a high voltage motor that goes straight onto the crankshaft and this thing's just instantaneous the steering in this is perfectly balanced when you're moving at speed it's got a nice heavy feel to it that adds to the stability of the car but the minute you drop that speed back and you start maneuvering it becomes a lot lighter which makes it a lot easier to to move into parking spaces or moving around town it's just perfectly balanced in both of those environments something they've done a fantastic job there one thing that does strike me as quite odd is the noise the brake pedal makes now this will be a Servo boosted assist I would guess unless there's some funky hybrid stuff going on under there which as far as I'm concerned is some sort of dark magic Wizardry but when you push the brake pedal every time you get a weird squelch now it's not a huge problem but if you're sat in the car and you haven't got your music up loud every time you go to break squelch it's weird as far as visibility goes is really actually quite good in here is worlds apart from the F-type but then a very different application of vehicle and you don't really need a huge amount of driving AIDS things like blind spot this car doesn't have it but don't really think you need it you've got an auto dimming rear view mirror to help with the Dazzle and that's about it these pillars are really Slim doesn't obstruct a lot of your view and there's not a massive blind spot you can really see around using those nice big mirrors without too much worry the two liter diesel mild hybrid is a four-cylinder turbocharged engine with electronic assist churning out 163 brake horsepower now those 163 horses will catapult you to at the top speed of 135 miles an hour and it will get you from 0 to 60. in 6.9 seconds now we're not going to break any land speed records with that but for a big heavy 4x4 Chelsea tractor that's quite good I think now with that 163 brake horsepower isn't going to lose your driving license just quite as quick as you'd like rest assured there are different models you can get in the engine Department you can get a 300 horsepower V6 petrol very similar to the engine or almost identical to the one that they put in the F-type and you can get 575 brake Horsepower Supercharged V8 lump in the svr which is identical to the engine that they put in the F-type svr and if either of those two don't do it for you you're probably in the wrong business now a small change but one that makes a huge difference to the Driving Experience is the redesign of these paddles that sit behind the steering wheel yes this car is not a track Queen you're not going to be slapping up and down the gearbox hammering it through the Apex of your favorite corner on your favorite race track maybe if that's what you bought this car for but this is more suited to the Chelsea tractor lifestyle but what it does mean is that if you want to grab a handful of the gearbox you can really find that paddle a lot easier and it makes pulling out of Junctions or overtaking on Dual carriageways a lot easier now that two liter diesel four-banger churning out 163 brake horsepower will get you anywhere between 35.2 to 46.8 miles to the gallon on the book real world has anyone's guess until we actually get one and start doing some driving in it but on paper that's the figures that are claimed by Jaguar now this thing's not going to break any land speed records anytime soon but if you kick it over into Dynamic mode knock it down Beyond drive into sport mode it does have quite a bit of poke and I think that's where you get the assistance from the the electric part of that mild hybrid it does pick up really quickly in mine the pre-face lift that's just a two liter diesel there's no hybrid aspect to it and when you grab a foot full of the carpet through the pedal it kicks down the gears it's like stirring a bowl of soup with the gearbox whereas in this when you put your foot down it's instantaneous and there's no there's no scrambling for Gears the car just gets on with it and no he's not going to break the sound barrier but it just picks up the speed and makes overtaking so much easier and safer really well designed now let's talk about the big ticket item the price and this this one's been a really hard one for me to wrap my head around because the used car and the new car market is drastically different to what it was a year ago two years ago we can thank brexit we can thank covid we can thank the sewers Canal we can thank Russia the list goes on as to why there are economical crisis is in place that are impacting the global economy and it's no secret that the car market has suffered probably a lot more than quite a few other sectors in that but that said the book price of one of these on the road albeit base level entry level they start a Chester shade over 45 000 pounds I think 45 098 pounds which is a heck of a lot of car for the money especially when you look at the refinements that have been made to this and it really firmly plants it in the same league as in my opinion a Range Rover Sport or Velar going back to scratching that itch if you want that svr because the 163 brake horsepower in this isn't going to cut it for you I think they retail they start from about 78 575 I'll bang it down there hopefully my memory is right which again is a lot of car for the money when you think you're getting a 575 brake horsepower car that's that's a lot lower car for for the money if you were to look for the equivalent in a Range Rover I should imagine you'd be comfortably looking around 120 000 pound mark so this is really Bittersweet this is a lovely car it's got that mild hybrid technology that I keep talking about but Jaguar a stopping production of all internal combustion engines by 2025. so it's yet to be seen what their plan is with cars like this are they going to completely discontinue the f-pace in favor of things like the eyepiece or are they going to put an electronic engine is it an engine I don't know an electronic motor and power plant and transmission into this chassis and I genuinely hope here's the latter because this is such a lovely place to be it's light years ahead of the i-pace I've really not done myself any favors in testing this car because I I want one Powers distributed between the front rear axles in this because remember it's an all-wheel drive audix to be specific the way the power was distributed between the two axles is is brilliant the F-type if you come out of a corner too quickly that back end is getting really tail happy now I know there's there's about 400 more brake horsepower in the F-type which is contributing factor absolutely but when you come out of a corner in this or you put your foot down on a you know anything other than a straight trajectory it just grips the road phenomenally um you can really feel the computers doing their bit between the two axles and that's that famous Jaguar uh distribution of power between the axles it will always have the rear wheel drive predominantly in use and the minute it senses that loss of traction it will kick over into all-wheel drive and that's really noticeable and it really gives a great Driving Experience what Jaguar have managed to achieve with this is creating two cars the original F pace and the facelift f-pace that are so dissimilar but so alike in so many ways and I think they've been very sympathetic in in the way they've designed them and the way they've approached face lifting this model which is really nice to see from the outside it's different enough to look modern yet still easily identifiable as an f-pace and what really sort of took me aback was as you get into the car you'd be forgiven for thinking you're not even in an f-pace anymore it doesn't look anything like its predecessor and it's just a fantastic place to be even the entry level two liter diesels got enough power when you combine it with the mild hybrid technology you're not really left wanting for anything as I said earlier you're not going to break any land speed records in this but that's not what this car is designed for this is your grocery go-getter this is for running the kids down to football practice or for going out mountain biking for the day with your bikes on the bike rack on your Deployable tow bar that's a fantastic option in these cars I dare say if you had the svr variant it would hold up very well around track probably going to spark a bit of controversy with this statement but I think the car is let down by the Pirelli P Zeros that come as standard on this I've just upgraded both of our cars to Continental and to Michelin and it's night and day in the grip you have on the road Chapo Jaguar I think you've done an incredibly good job in reimaging the f-pace there's no secret that Jaguar have had their financial troubles recently they've been all over the financial times and the News various issues with with stock and ownership and sales projections all that type of thing but this car I can see very easily catapulting Jaguar back up right next to Range Rover in exactly where they should be in the luxury 4x4 Market [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] of the new face lifted Jaguar f-pace I've really enjoyed my time in this car a big thank you to Harvard's Chichester for giving me this give me the time to enjoy it and also the time to fall in love of it to the point where I think they're probably going to end up costing me quite a bit of money in the near future so top marks for your sales taxis guys but also top marks for the the accommodating and Incredibly friendly people at Harvard Chichester thank you as always if you're not already subscribed to the Channel please think about smashing that button down the bottom and I'll see you in the next video peace [Music] thank you oh does it oh no let's try again [Music] [Music]
71;Jaguar;2023 F-Pace;Jaguar F-Pace: A family SUV with a sporting edge.;buyers of mid-sized premium SUVs are truly spoiled for Choice those looking for luxury can go for something such as an Audi Q5 BMW X3 or Volvo XC60 and if you're looking for something a little more sporty than perhaps a Porsche Macan or an Alfa Romeo stelvio what if you're looking for something in the middle well a Jaguar f-pace could definitely fit that bill it's been with us since 2016 which is a long old wild but various facelifts and improvements along the way means it's now a more compelling proposition than ever it's available with a range of petrol and diesel engines most of which have mild hybrid technology however the one we're playing with today is the p400e plug-in hybrid which will be the one to go for if you're a company car driver because it's low CO2 emissions will save you a packet in monthly benefiting kind company car tax bills however you come by your car you're going to need it to be a practical family carry-all kind of car so how does it score on that front well first of all you get a powered tailgate as standard which is very useful and a decent Square opening and most versions get upwards of 600 liters the downside of the 400e is that the battery packs sit underneath the boot floor so they do eat into that space a little bit that leaves the figure you're left with down at 485 liters to be fair that's still more than the 450 liters you get in the plug-in version of the BMW X3 but the space available is heated into further by the fact there's no underfloor storage for stashing your charging cables so you'll have them rattling around in the main load area the elevated boot floor also leaves you with this odd slope up to the level part and when you fold the 40 20 40 split folding rear seats down it also leaves you with this awkward step down to the backs of the rear seats talking of the rear seats they have lots of leg room when you need to put people in them and there's plenty of Headroom even with the optional panoramic sunroof in fact you'd have to be well over six foot tall before you find yourself rubbing your head on the ceiling and the middle seat is plenty wide enough so you can definitely fit three people side by side although shoulder room is a little bit of a squeeze we mentioned earlier that the f-pace has undergone various improvements and nowhere is it more evident than in here when it first came out it trailed its German competition both in terms of quality and ergonomics now however it's up there with the best of them on the quality front the materials are now plusher and the various switches work in a faultlessly slick way so it all feels very classy indeed those clever switches also help improve ergonomics as does the latest pivypro touchscreen infotainment system the graphics are sharp the screen transitions are slick and the operating system is well laid out and intuitive we still prefer systems with a rotary dial controller but as touch screens go this is about as good as it gets the one remaining ergonomic annoyance is the gear selector because it's got this kind of trigger thing at the back of it which you must press every time you want to go either from drive to reverse or reverse to drive and if you forget which can often happen the desired gear change doesn't engage and so we're driving forwards and then we park so we're reversing and then we want to drive forwards again and it will still move but we're going backwards and I want to go forwards there we go [Applause] since we've established we're driving the plug-in hybrid version of the Jaguar f-pace let's start with the Driving Experience aspect of it there's an electric motor and a two liter four-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine producing just shy of 400 brake horsepower and that power goes to all four wheels as you would expect with that sort of power output this is not a slow car when you floor the throttle naught to 60 takes just five seconds and so the surge of acceleration you feel is very strong indeed the power delivery isn't always as responsive as it might be though especially when you're driving along a more gentle speed and when you're doing this the chances are you're powering it by Electric only and so it's very peaceful and gentle and quiet and you can do that for up to 40 miles on full battery charge however when you put your foot down for a burst of additional acceleration the drivetrain often thinks that the motor can give you the desired level acceleration on its own but then it often changes its mind after a couple of seconds where upon the petrol engine fires up and gives you an extra surge of acceleration that pause sometimes gives you the impression that although the performance is undeniably strong it's sometimes a little bit harder to get at like many plug-in hybrids do it does feel a bit heavy on the brakes when you're pulling up and stopping it's no surprise really that the plug-in hybrid version of the f-pace is a good few hundred kilos heavier than other f-paces one concern about all that extra weight is that it might ruin the f-pace's Stellar handling but we're happy to report that it doesn't Okay so it may be a fraction less agile and alert than other f-paces but it's still a really enjoyable car to hustle along with a level of poise and precision that belies its size the steering is a particular highlight because it is well weighted accurate and Deft this combined with the Jaguars other handling attributes means it flows from corner to corner both effortlessly and gracefully there is a payoff for that nimbleness though all f-paces have a firm ride which means that although they stop short of being uncomfortable they are still less comfortable than many key rivals more powerful derivatives of the car the p400e included have adaptive suspension fitted as standard which is optional on more humble models and it definitely makes the car more compliant although it never loses that firm Edge you can switch between Dynamic comfort and eco-driving modes which among other things softens off or firms up the dampers or you can select your own settings for the various parameters using the touchscreen from a ride perspective if you really really concentrate you can just about tell the difference but for most people most of the time the differences are so marginal that they're almost indistinguishable a word of warning you shouldn't go into p400e ownership thinking that that claimed official fuel economy figure of 176 miles per gallon is going to be realistic because those figures are done in laboratory setups and if you're going to get anywhere near close to that you'll be needing to charge it regularly and barely call upon that petrol engine at all we've got around 30 miles per gallon during our time with the car and if you regularly enjoy its strong performance and sporty attitude you'll probably get even less than that however if you're a company car driver your monthly tax amount will be calculated using those official figures which means it will cost you a lot less than any other FPS which means the P400 is a good option if you're a company car driver because you still get the same levels of comfort quality Prestige and standard levels of equipment sounds pretty good to us please do let us know in the

72;Jaguar;2023 F-Pace;2023 Jaguar F-Pace P250 S Review - Walk Around and Test Drive;Jaguar is one of those manufacturers that has stood the test of time going way back to the mid-1930s they're also a brand that has a proud and long lineage in the automotive World whether it's racing or producing great sports cars and grand Tours late last decade Jaguar decided to go in the crossover Direction with the E and F pace and people are wondering did Jaguar make the right choice but we have seen some other Rivals do the exact same such as Porsche with the Macan and the cayenne and also recently the maserag or kale and Levante but I want to take a deep dive into the f-pace see what this vehicle is all about is it Dynamic and sporty is it a crossover that's upscale and very premium quality to match its price point but also is it a vehicle at around 60 to 70 thousand dollars that's giving you everything you could possibly want in a luxury crossover now before we get in this video I want to give a huge shout and thank you to Jaguar Land Rover of Peabody and Peabody Massachusetts for allow me to this review the link will be in the description below so you can check out their extensive jaguar and Land Rover inventory also before we get started make sure to hit the Subscribe button and click the notification Bell so you're notified every time a new video goes live on the channel and so without wasting any further time let's get right in this review deciding to join the crossover Market has been lucrative for many non-mainstream manufacturers who for the longest time didn't want to tarnish their Legacies some Brands made a switch but at the expense of selling their souls to produce mundane crossovers that lacked inspiration and driving characteristics that enthusiasts could enjoy the Jaguar f-pace quickly Incorporated attributes from the luxury sedans in the lineup while also appealing to power hungry drivers giving them a wide range of powertrains including a V8 with the svr on the complete opposite side of the spectrum you're the P250 a mall that looks fun and engaging but for those not looking to spend close to 100 Grand is it the perfect fit for those looking for a well-balanced daily driver starting off with pricing the Jaguar f-pace p250s comes in at a base cost of fifty six thousand dollars placed just below the P400 within the lineup unlike larger competitors the f-pace is the flagship crossover for the brand as there is no 30 alternative planned for the foreseeable future and as a result it's likely going to be the vehicle of choice compared to the smaller e-pace despite being mostly credited for its performance-oriented reputation the f-pace is surprisingly practical and spacious and in fact is slightly longer and wider compared to German competitors offsetting the lower roof line and F-Type inspired rear fascia to retain an adequate amount of cargo capacity and interior space for second row passengers the full paint finish around the wheel arches is enough to conclude that this crossover is specifically designed for on-road driving but with the ground clearance of 8.4 inches you should have no problem taking on unplowed streets during the winter in many regards the f-pace often gets overlooked as Jaguar is a niche brand specialized for a very specific type of buyer but also this crossover hasn't seen a major overhaul since its arrival to showrooms late last decade yet there has been a minor cosmetic facelift in recent years adding very subtle changes to the row presence the beauty of the f-pace's design is that incorporates the front fascia from the XF appearing more like a lifted car rather than a rugged SUV as a striking Body Lines Marines a dynamic yet sophisticated style to this vehicle while may be controversial we prefer the breast of aluminum accents for the grill on this model rather than opting for the gloss black exterior pack as gloss black trim is still present along the side profile and around the fog lights completing a classy look for the f-pace standard LED headlights will provide more than enough lighting when traveling at night but also the L-shaped date time rain lights does draw your attention when taking a first glance at this crossover moving over to the side profile our model is sitting on 21 inch 5 split spoke satin dark gray wheels which fits the design of the f-pace more so than the 19s however if ride quality and having a softer suspension is a top priority go with the smaller tires yet we found the 21s to be perfectly fine as road noise was kept to a minimum and how this crossover manage the imperfections in the road was similar to what we've experienced from rivals you'll have body color folding side mirrors with turn signal indicators to go along with blind spot detection for added safety then coming around the back taking inspiration from the F-type and XF the thin LED tail lights they wrap around the final third of this crossover is likely one of the first things you'll notice for the f-pace along with a sportier and coupe-like roofline tuck beneath the bumper will be the dual exhaust Outlets keeping the rear fascia looking clean but also as previously mentioned gloss black accents tie the appearance of the f-pace together as the color contrast complements the gray exterior very well under the hood the P250 is powered by a 2-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 246 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque and is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission while Jaguar is mostly associated with being a performance focused brand with this powertrain the f-paces on-road composure is similar to many rivals in this market where the driving Dynamics are tuned for a quieter and more relaxed experience rather than putting you on the edge of your seat however when accelerating and entering highways the f-pace has no problem putting the power down especially in the range between 20 and 60 miles per hour also the a-speed automatic transitions through the gear smoothly complementing this model's luxury first approach for the drivetrain all-wheel drive does come standard for all trims whether it's the P250 P400 or svr to provide year-round versatility and for fuel economy you're looking at right around 22 miles per gallon in the city and 27 miles per gallon on the highway stepping inside you could buy a classy and certainly British designed interior as a light oyster perforated leather seats contrast nicely with the ebony dashboard and subtle wood grain trim for both the driver and passenger on this model they'll have 16 way power adjustable heated ventilated and memory seats that offer plenty of support and cushioning and you'll have the ability to upgrade the Windsor leather for a more opulent experience in front of you between the analog gauges there will be a digital display that showcases basic information and while not equipped on this P250 opting for the head up display might be worth the additional one thousand dollars if you prefer keeping your eyes on the road rather than looking down at the gauge cluster or at the infotainment system and speaking of the head unit you'll have an 11 inch touchscreen with Apple carplay and Android auto compatibility to go along with onboard navigation and the Meridian sound system functioning much like a tablet there isn't much of a learning curve when navigating your way through the different menus as it's clean laid out and quick to respond better yet and still great to see in 2023 is the physical dials for the Dual Zone clock Patrol rather than having to waste time and taking your eyes off the road to adjust the temperature from the touchscreen the infotainment system will also be home to the settings that customize your drive modes if configurable and active Dynamics have been equipped on your P250 and for those who anticipate many thrilling road trips there is a stopwatch to measure lap times and also a g meter ambient lighting is also optional helping to set the mood and bring a solid sense of luxury to the cabin finally you will have a rear backup camera with trajectory to go along with front and rear parking sensors the rest of the Interior is minimalistic in design with a wireless phone charging pad conveniently placed beneath the touchscreen and for the center console to the right of the gear shifter will be the drive mode selector where you can quickly change between Eco Comfort Dynamic and adaptive surface response which helps deliver the right amount of torque for a new encounter different types of Road surfaces the center storage compartment you have plenty of room for smaller items like a wallet and smartphone and rounding out the front seating area above will be a panoramic moonroof which will let in a lot of natural light to the interior now moving on to the second row we're going to start off on the passenger side and this heat has been adjusted a bit further back it's not on a recline but I have plenty of legroom here and when you take a look at what the Jaguar fbase is providing on paper when it comes to Interior spacing it is on par with a lot of its Rivals which is a bit of a surprise because with the f-pace you have a lower roof line or it has that sportier roof line with the sporty rear fascia but also you would think that the interior wouldn't be that spacious from the outside as the fbase does have more of an athletic design to it and yet here I am at around five five so not the tallest person out there but I'm pretty comfortable back here there's a lot of legroom a lot of Headroom I do think that for taller passengers they should be able to sit back here pretty comfortably and not need to worry about hitting their head on the headliner even with the massive panoramic moon roof also when it comes to shoulder room plenty of it the f-pace is rather wide a bit wider than some compact crossovers in this price range and market so you don't even really need to worry about this vehicle not being family friendly or conducive for you and your family now moving on to the center seat there are some good placements for your feet there is a very aggressive Center hump which is similar to what we see for grand Tours and when I look at the F Pace from the outside but also when you're on the road driving it around it does have a grand tour like feel when it comes to handling when it comes to the suspension and just the ride quality overall and the fact that we do have this aggressive Center hump though is very similar in a characteristic that we see from the sports cars in the lineup now because this vehicle is somewhat wide I think you can fit a third person back here I think you can you can have three average size adults sit back here pretty comfortably and they won't feel claustrophobic at all then on the driver's side the seat is adjusted to someone of my height around five five and I have a lot of legroom here where I can just sit back relax and enjoy the Driving Experience now since this is a two-row crossover these seats don't recline which isn't too much of a surprise but still these seats do provide a lot of support and cushioning where I think on a longer drive you won't be tired after that long two to three hour road trip with the family also backing you do have two rare air vents that our model does not have heated outboard seats you do have a 12 volt Outlet and rounding out the second row seating area you do get a center armrest with two cup holders now coming around to the back you're going to receive a power liftgate and inside behind the second row seats you're looking at right around 31 and a half cubic feet of room making the f-pace one of the more practical crossovers in this market and price range this is far better than the Alfa Romeo stelvio Mercedes-Benz GLC Porsche Macan and also the new Maserati gracale you can have plenty of room to fit all your luggage if you are going on a road trip with the family also out there to fit all my camera today so it's two bags of camera gear a gimbal box and a tripod no problem at all and probably could have gone grocery shopping after this review as well due to the size of this cargo area it's nice and wide also of course even though this is a crossover it's very easy to load your gear back here as well then with the second row seats folded you're looking at close to 70 cubic feet of room once again putting the f-pace as being one of the more practical options in this market so if you are moving stuff around maybe you're going skiing and snowboarding you'll be able to fit all your equipment when you are going on that road trip or Journey then on the left side of the rear cargo area you will some netting force of smaller items such as water bottles car detail equipment or a first aid kit but more importantly beneath the floor mat you will find a spare tire which is really great to see in 2023 as a lot of brands have removed this feature entirely for most Vehicles so if you encounter a flat on your road trips or travels you can fix that and be back on the road also minor features that I really like is the rear cargo cover which will keep all your valuable items out of sight so if you are like me and you have camera gear or anything else of value you can leave them back here and have that peace of mind knowing that no will be able to peek in and steal what you have and then once you're done just press the button and the lift gate will close automatically so we're now behind the wheel of the 2023 Jaguar f-pace 250. let's see how this vehicle performs how it handles how it drives how it compares to other premium luxury crossovers in this market and also see if the four cylinder is providing more than enough at this price point for Jaguar it's all about the experience and the complete package if you're somebody specifically looking at the Jaguar f-pace you want premium luxury you want refinement you want quality and that's exactly what you're going to experience with this crossover now you can upgrade to Windsor leather which I would highly recommend and there's actually a few packages that I would go with for this particular trim and with this powertrain because with the P250 obviously you're not prioritizing performance you don't need the V6 and obviously you're not looking at the V8 with the svr so quality and comfort is certainly something that you're going to be drawn into and the Windsor leather is certainly going to heighten that experience now the leather we have today is more than adequate in fact these seats are very aggressively bolstered for a vehicle that's not performance oriented very supportive what I also like too is a seating position as well you sit pretty high up in this vehicle but when it really stands out to me and this is one reasons why I think the f-pace is kind of like the Alfa Romeo stelvio and Porsche Macan in a certain way is that you feel as though you're one with the chassis of this crossover rather than sitting on top of it and you can definitely tell that the f-pace is inspired by the F-type in some way shape or form when it comes to visibility when you are behind the wheel you have a nice panoramic view a-pillars are actually very thin for a vehicle in this market so you won't have any blind spots when you are approaching an intersection then taking a look at your side mirrors they are decently sized and they're placed in the right spot so I can see what's behind me and then looking out back you are going to have that sportier rear facial so you can have a thinner rear window now I can see what's directly behind me but the headrests might get in the way in certain situations the ride quality is certainly a standout to me I have been driving this vehicle around for about 10 minutes and even with the larger tire size you barely feel any imperfections on the roadways but also compared to other crossovers in this market that I've driven whether it's BMW Audi Mercedes-Benz I think the ride quality is certainly higher and more conducive for somebody who is going on longer road trips than what we've seen from competitors the suspension is very soft but I have seen mixed reviews on that where some people say the suspension is a bit rigid and stiff now I think that's probably Jaguar f-paces with the dynamic handling package which I would recommend if you are looking for an engaging Driving Experience behind the wheel although I would still go with a package that really prioritizes that interior comfort that just my take for a vehicle at this price point also installation is Top Notch you don't really hear any of the outside world at all in fact all I'm hearing is that four-cylinder engine no road noise no wind noise this is a very well insulated crossover it isolates you from the outside world which I think is what really adds to the appeal for Jaguar in general Jaguar is giving you an experience of sixty five thousand dollars much like Porsche is with the Macan and also Maserati with the gracale one of the observations that I have here with the f-pace is that for a crossover that you would think is all luxury it does have Dynamic handling characteristics and qualities here where the steering is certainly responsive but also well nudge of the wheel and it's already taking the corner which is something I really wasn't expecting here for this crossover because with the P250 you think all right turbo 4 you do get really high quality materials for the interior soft ride quality also a quiet cabin and that's usually a recipe for a vehicle that isn't going to have a bad side to it and yet this is a very pleasant vehicle to drive around it doesn't hide that it does have some sporty driving characteristics and a sporty personality which is something I can really appreciate as an Enthusiast as someone who loves driving so in Dynamic mode right off the line [Music] not bad not bad at all what I noticed is that Dynamic mode actually changes up the driving experience which some vehicles that have a turbo 4 don't really give you that it's more like a fake sport experience but what I have noticed is that the powertrain and the engine performs very quickly also the gear shifts are more aggressive also that engine note does get a bit louder if you have really nice paddle shifters that are very high quality feel very premium in the hands and again that's something that you would experience from a Jaguar just being a brand is all about luxury but also that performance as well so again even though you're going to say well Mike you know we're spending maybe an extra 10 to 15 grand for an f-pace over some of the competitors but you are getting a vehicle where the interior quality is one step above everyone else in this segment also really nice leather wrapped steering wheel as well with aggressive 10-2 positions but also supportive nine and three positions everything else about the interior is really driver Centric and Driver focused I love the infotainment system that is placed well within reach also you still have physical dials for the climb control settings and it's very minimalistic but it's minimalistic in a way where it doesn't feel as though this vehicle is giving you a cheaper or unrefined experience you also have plenty of shoulder room as well with the wide center console but what I will say this is that the f-pace does get overlooked in many regards I think maybe it has something to do with the pricing but again you're buying this vehicle for the experience and what it brings to the table overall but from a practicality standpoint it's one of the most spacious vehicles in this market and price range it's not something you would really think when you look at this vehicle from the outside because it does have that sportier rear fascia it does have that lower roof line it's a crossover that's typical for a premium luxury brand that doesn't want to deviate too far away from its performance heritage and yet what Jaguar has done here is given you a vehicle that also feels very upscale but still even in its most basic form has handling characteristics that is certainly going to inspire a lot of confidence on back roads [Music] I am in Dynamic mode are at highway speeds so for a crossover with a 0-60 time of around 6.9 seconds this certainly feels on par with a lot of other turbocharged force on engine powered vehicles in this market in fact I think Jaguar is really underrating the performance of this vehicle severely because it doesn't feel slow or lethargic when you compare the f-pace to some of its closest Rivals that are not mainstream like that Volvo XC60 like the Genesis gb70 with the turbo 4 or even the Porsche Macan the jaguar f-pace in my mind still has that Dynamic feel more so than the Volvo XC60 but also has the comfort and the luxury that would match what you get with the Porsche Macan so what Jaguar is banking on here and what they've always done too for their entirety of their history is that they're giving you a vehicle where it's Unique it's really more of an individualized experience that you're not going to find from maybe BMW Audi or Mercedes-Benz it's a bit more specific and it's a bit more special than what we see from other mainstream rivals now at highway speeds it has a nice composure on the roadways even with the larger tire size now if you are looking for Comfort I would go with the 19s but with the 21s I don't think the ride quality is diminished at all so ultimately after this test drive the Jaguar f-pace threw some curveballs today which I'm pleasantly surprised and I'm glad to see because with the P250 I had a perception of this vehicle before taking it out on the roadways I'm thinking okay it's gonna feel like a lot of non-performance oriented models in this market and price range is probably not going to feel Dynamic it's probably going to lean very heavily towards being a luxury vehicle and yet it's a crossover that's classy but has a bad side to it and that's something that I think a lot of buyers are going to enjoy that it's not just going to be luxury all time it's not just going to be upscale and availa has more of a laid-back demeanor it's a vehicle that you can have some fun with on the roadways and to a blast to drive on your weekly commutes so to wrap up my time with the 2023 Jaguar f-pace what are my final thoughts and takeaways for this luxury crossover compared to most rivals in this market the f-pace has Grand Tour like Tendencies from the exterior to the interior and also the driving Dynamics what I really like about this vehicle is that yes Jaguar is a premium luxury manufacturer but they also didn't deviate too far away from their Heritage with this crossover where the driving Dynamics even with the turbocharged force on the engine is very engaging but also the handling is Snappy and very fluid and it's exactly what you would expect from a vehicle that is really taking a lot of the same characteristics and DNA that we see from the F-type and other sporty vehicles from the Jaguar brand but also this vehicle can double as being a great family crossover but also a comfortable and upscale daily driver where the interior quality is certainly memorable also of course if you go with the Windsor leather seats you're going to have an experience that's very similar to what we see from the Porsche Macan and also the new Maserati gracale also I love the fact that the interior layout is simplistic but everything is within Arm's Reach but still done so in a way where you don't feel as though this vehicle has an interior that reflects a price point of maybe 40 or 50 000 this does feel very much like a sixty five thousand dollar crossover also it is very practical with the amount of cargo space you have behind the second row seats but also the interior spacing as well for both up front and that second row But ultimately it boils down to the complete package that the f-pace is providing where it can be fun and engaging when you pop it in Dynamic mode and you're going to have the stiffer handling you're going to have a vehicle that can perform quite well even with the turbocharged four-cylinder engine but at the same time you also have the interior Comfort where you don't want to leave this vehicle on a longer Drive live even for myself after doing a 30 minute test drive I want to continue on and that's something I don't normally say for a lot of vehicles in this market but also as Jaguar has moved in the crossover Direction what I can really appreciate is that this crossover does feel like a sedan it feels like a sports car and it's great to see that Jaguar didn't deviate too far away from their Heritage where the f-pace is a completely foreign vehicle to somebody who has purchased an XF or an XE or other vehicles that Jaguar has offered for the past 20 or 30 years and that's one thing I think a lot of buyers have certainly appreciated and enjoyed about the f-pace so guys thank you so much for watching this video please like comment share and

73;Jaguar;2023 F-Pace;2023 Jaguar F-Pace S: Is The F-Pace Worth Buying?;so we're going to get up and get our acceleration here hey everyone it's ben hardy here and instead they're going to be reviewing a jaguar f-pace s first and foremost though a huge shout out thank you to the jaguar here in downtown so like for giving me some time with this fps this one is available for sale for the time being so if you're interested i'll include a link to their website in the description down below definitely check them out and then on a side note if you save time money the next time purchase car link to my car buying guide in the description down below as well let's get into it [Music] under the hood we have a turbocharged 2-liter four-cylinder that goes through an 8-speed automatic transmission fuel economy is 22 around 10 and then 27 on the highway with power plus being 246 horsepower and then 269 pound-feet of torque now the reason i'm showing you guys the key fob instead of my normal transition clip is because this has the cool function where you can turn the lights on and off with the key fob which is definitely fun first off i love this blue it definitely pops out quite a bit and it's way more exciting than what you normally see on f paces which is usually like white or gray or silver just like most other cars you guys can see here with the distinctive lines on the hood and then coming down below notice here with the daytime lights and again if i pop on the headlight and then you can see with the parking sensor and the venting off to the side and then notice here with the grille all blacked out with the jaguar logo front and center and then more parking sensors here at the bottom and well there's the front end come around the side here tar and wheel setup is 265 40 22 in the front and over in the rear as well and then notice how the wheel is all blacked out and look at the spoke design it's very interesting like from a distance it looks like you're really just like large spokes and then you kind of zoom in a little bit and it changes quite a bit notice here with the jaguar logo there on this black piece of trim and then if we take a few steps back most everything is body paint including the mirrors and the door handles but obviously you got the black on the wheels and then also look at the body work there on the bottom how that is also black to create some contrast here's a key fob yet again and we're going to hold down that button right there and this will pop open the rear hatch notice that little cover comes up with the hatch we have a little jaguar bag here on the back lots of lots of stuff that comes with this car brand new and you guys can see here with the seats you can fold those down if you want and i love these like metallic plaques here down below i think those look fantastic and last but not least if we pick this up it's pretty heavy spare tire is just underneath the loading floor and then when you're all done just press that button right there and that'll lower your thing down clean the cargo cover that's already built into the hatch now finishing things up with the rest of the rear notice the spoiler here at the top again finished in blue then we have the signature f-pace tail lights with another blacked out jaguar logo and then f-pace down below parking sensors here at the bottom with more blacked out trims so basically the whole bottom of the car is black and then the whole top is pretty much blue now here's the rear door panel notice with the leather trim at the top and then the wood trim down below that and then more leather trim down below that and then look at the metallic trim just so many different elements to take in meridian sound system it's got some speakers for that and then here the seats which are a lot more simplistic than the door panel it was perforated all down the center portion and then popping in really easy to get in here's your legroom headroom and then you guys can see with the storage pocket we've got some vents right there and then we have our charge port then cupholder armrest set up and let's head to the front now here's the front door panel notice with the leather trim at the top and then again the wood trim down below just like the back definitely a really beautiful looking door panel and look at the controls for the windows that's definitely nice and fancy looking all of the adjustments for the mirrors taking a lot of stuff out of the range rover lineup is what i'm noticing blind spot lighting for the mirrors and then here are the seats and us with the jaguar logo there that's pretty cool and then perforated all down the center of these seats and then we do have our power adjustments right there jaguar logo yet again pretty normal pedal layout and that is for the hatch and then more leather trim here on the dash and let's pop in nice now here's the steering wheel notice we've got that beautiful two-tone design that's in other parts of the interior and then we've got these really nice paddle shifters here on the back we've got controls for phone controls voice command controls cruise control heated steering button on the other side and just all of it together looks fantastic turn signal slash light stock windshield wiper stock and that's the ends of the stocks are also very nice from material standpoint now here's the gauge custard's half analog half digital and i love how like it bleeds into each other i think that's pretty interesting from an aesthetic perspective we do have a bunch of different menus we can scroll through just like other jaguars land rover models so if you've been in any of those vehicles within the last couple years this is going to look very familiar to you and overall i think they did a good job with the design there now here's the infotainment system first off if we pop in reverse we do have a backup camera with trajectory lines that turn with the steering wheel and yeah i can even change the camera viewpoint there which is always fun now aside from that with the rest infotainment system first off you've got the shortcut bar here on the side and then notice here with the main screen response time is fantastic pretty easy to use overall and you guys can see the different tabs that we can go into with that now down below in this area we've got a bunch of different shortcut buttons here so like if i press this button and by the way after like fully press in this will pull up stuff for the seats i love how it says just seat heat but the seats are heated and cooled which is kind of interesting but you can also control a bunch of things with these controls so push in that's for the seats and notice i have the ac seat function on right now push again and then that'll go back to the temperature and then pull it and that'll give you fan speed and then push it and that will put you back to the main menu and so yeah really cool how they are basically throwing a bunch of controls into one area to keep the minimalist design here and then we do have a wireless phone charger notice here at the stop start button and the volume control i'm glad they have like a volume control so you can just go to a physical button don't have to do everything in the screen and then notice the shifter as well we do have our off-road cruise control and then we've got stability control and then with the drive mode select so you push this and then this will allow you to change the drive modes they do pop up here in the center so we've got quite a few drive modes so you can see we've got a comfort we have a dynamic on the one side and then on the other side we've got an eco rain and ice and snow i guess it's all into one mode so four modes they keep it pretty straightforward here's the center console first off we pulled it back we've got a couple of cup holders and then 12 volts right there nice leather trim and then there's a storage cubby underneath here on the center console with some nice metallic trim all around it center console this muse piece then we've got the glove box and notice the material used here on the dash just very top-notch stuff and then we do have a center of here at the very top it's a full panoramic got the controls for it right there and that's all so first off blue fire blue that's a pretty blue name for this blue color anyways standard equipment and then warranty which is a five-year 60 000 mile that's pretty dang good uh and then over here on the optional equipment side you can see the base price four options fifty four thousand and then this paint color actually for a cool special paint color is pretty inexpensive sometimes you see pretty expensive paint colors with some of these custom paint jobs anyways that's the equipment total msrp 65 875 let's see how it drives let's go over visibility before we set off here's your visibility over the hood and through both of the mirrors then throughout the rest of the rear and let's set off so setting off in the f-pace s and honestly i am super impressed it's actually been quite some time since i have reviewed uh any uh f-paces or just a jaguar model in general and i forgot how nice these are i and that's the thing that's the thing that like happens with his car review stuff but sometimes you don't see a car for a while and you're like wow i forgot how nice that thing was and yeah that's definitely what happened uh today and that's why i try to review cars uh as often as possible so i can stay uh you know up to date and everything on all of it so first off really smooth from a ride quality perspective and it looks like this one i didn't see the window sticker but it looks like it has a solar attenuating windshield which kind of like an interesting thing you can like see a little weave in the windshield itself that person totally just ran a red light okay um every single time i review cars here in downtown so like something always happens that's on the gopro it's always funny uh other stuff sea comfort's great i'm so glad this has air-conditioned seats because it's a pretty toasty day it says 104 degrees on the thermostat right there so uh yeah actually that's pretty uncomfortable so nice that i'm comfortable right and other stuff here noise installation pretty dang good and this turbocharged four-cylinder is doing a pretty solid job here at elevation that's for sure i love the feel of um the turn signals just that end piece obviously the rest of the stock's plastic but you don't really touch the rest of the stock most the time but that end piece you know having some nice trim on it definitely makes me feel like i'm doing something premium every single time i turn on the turn signal oh there's a rivien over there starting to see those all the time now but let's pop it into gotta push the dial so i can pop it over into dynamic there we go so we're gonna get up and get our acceleration here this thing moves this thing definitely moves now i'm interested to see with the uh gear shifts here with this strip to put down into s mode for wait s mode oh there we go so to put an s mod to do the manual shifts oh yeah the transmission's super snappy so do i yeah go back to the drive and that puts back in automatic mode interesting um paddle shifters are also really nice from material standpoint again everything you touch in this car feels really nice and so fully summing things up i think the f-pace looks great this definitely drives sportier compared to it's like land rover counterparts those kind of go more on the luxury off-roader side of things whereas this goes more on the sport side of things so if you want a sporter sporter sportier on-road driving experience this gives that to you and also this pretty much at this point they used to kind of differentiate the brands a little bit more at the interior this is all land rover at this point which i have no complaints about whatsoever like i am completely fine with that because in general the jaguar models are usually less expensive than their land rover equivalents and so this also kind of is like a value play at the same time because like if you ch like cover this up the steering wheel with the controls the paddle shifters the infotainment system the minimalist controls down here like this is all new land rover like this is the same stuff that you see in the new full-size land rover that is a you know over six figures so really good value and i like uh the updates that they've done here to the f-pace to just make this interior feel a little more high quality and just a little bit more modern overall that's because something's up for our video on this jaguar f-pace s again a huge shout-out thank you to the jaguar here in downtown salt lake for giving me some time with this vehicle check out the info in the description down below i'll see ya
74;Jaguar;2023 F-Pace;2023 Jaguar F-Pace - Full Features Review & POV Test Drive;foreign [Music] ladies and gentlemen my name is Ty behind the camera and this is the 2023 Jaguar f-pace this one happens to be in the S trim and we are taking a look at a beautiful Portofino blue on Caraway tan interior uh beautiful vehicle let's take a look at today we're going to be detailing all of the features on the exterior as well as interior and we're also going to take it out for a test drive towards the end of the video so stay tuned with us and we're going to start off with the features of the exterior first off we have full LED headlamps as standard on every single f-pace for 2023 it's the high and low beams as well as the daytime running lights and turn signals are all illuminated you could see very nice um all lit up we also have headlight washers up up there as well we have some very nice subtle Chrome accents found throughout the vehicle mainly on the front with the side grilles and on the front main Grille very beautiful looking main Grille to this vehicle but we do have parking sensors that span the front bumper as well as the rear bumper and to round it all off at the very bottom we have led fog lights again looks very nice all illuminated yeah very nice looking Grille you can see the details and there we also have the Jaguar logo front and center the very nice creases that round out the hood that go down into the Grille and some very nice optional wheels that measure up at 20 inches as you can see the tires measure 255 50 up front and a very nice bi-color design for the wheels we have some nice elements towards the side and the with the Jaguar logo as well Chrome surrounding the and some nice painted silver accents down at the bottom of the doors and your silver roof rails and we're gonna make sunroof up top and the shark fin antennas up there too if we take a look towards the side mirrors we can see we have the blind spot warning and the turn signal indicators you also have smart key entry on all four of the door handles just press to lock and put your hand behind the handle to unlock again it goes for all four doors see this particular car stickers for 61 430 and we do have a couple of optional extras on this vehicle including the cold climate pack which we definitely need today is a quite cold day here in Connecticut I have a nice spoiler up here with again the Sharks antenna like you saw earlier and same up front same as up front we have led rear lights as well so the turn signals tail lights and brake lights are all LED on a very nice all lit up parking sensors again back here and a couple of badges such as the f-pace badge another Jaguar badging with the third wiper up top and down below the trunk release and the reversing camera and we also do have some hidden exhaust tips for that turbocharged four cylinder so what we think of the styling on the f-pace I personally have always loved the look of this car ever since it came out and it's a very nice design Evolution with the sort of same generation but definitely a facelift on that so let's discuss some of our drivetrain options since there are actually three different Motors you can get with the f-pace as of 2023 so accompanying us today in the S trim level as well as the basic F-Type trim is a two liter turbocharged in line four this produces 247 horsepower 269 pound-feet of torque then we also have the r Dynamic s which is the next trim level up that will have a three liter turbocharged inline six cylinder with 395 horsepower and 405 pounds of torque and then we have sort of the crazy uh trim level the svr that has a five liter supercharger V8 with 542 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque that is going to be quite the Bonkers SUV but for today we have more of the normal subdued powertrain uh which has plenty of power and we will figure out how that does on our test drive Loop other bits of information the drive is standard across the f-pace range and you also get an 8-speed automatic regardless of engine choice okay so we do have a full powered liftgate with the F case and once it's opened up we have a pretty good amount of space in there take a look at that lots and lots of goodies that come with this particular f-pace and a bit of accessories such as coat hangers and and things of that nature uh but yeah once you open it up good amount of space in here you even have grocery bag hangers to either side over here and towards the back some Led illumination again on either side and uh some storage extensions as well you also get this very nice all-weather mat and when you lift that up you of course have the carpeting and a bit of extra space underneath with all of your tire changing goodies underneath that we of course have a cargo shade that closes down with the trunk and as you can see if you're feeling strong you can close down the trunk with these handles or simply just press the button let's start off the interior with the rear seats namely the rear doors beautiful appointment on this interior for this vehicle I think it's just a a really really nice color combination the dark blue and the sort of Light tan leather interior nice soft to the touch materials up here with uh sort of the same color stitching a very nice sort of wood grain as well as lots of just bright work on the inside of this car with these speaker grilles and the door grabs and also some more speaker accents down below but just take a look at this color you know it's not a really light tan and it's also not a brown it's a very nice uh sort of in between to those two colors I think it looks beautiful I have the window switch and a bit of storage towards the bottom of course a couple of speakers on the door nice little stainless steel entryway and here is our rear seat very nice looking you can also fold down the rear headrest as you can see the passenger size fold down like that to get some more visibility out of the um the rear window you can also fold down the rear seats with this little switch right there as you can see they fold down flat you could fold down the pass-through with a little button right next to the center headrest and that of course will gain access to the trunk and uh if you needed a combination of cargo space and um the passenger space back here then that definitely has you covered and one more thing we can fold down is the center armrest and that has a couple of cup holders to a normal driving position for myself and I stand at five foot ten so just a frame of reference I do have a nice couple of inches of legroom back here for myself you also have these sort of accessory hooks to put in place uh coat hangers and things like that the Jaguar will provide for you we have a couple of air vents back here a little bit of storage and a 12 volt power outlet nice small drivetrain hump too so if you had this fit a center passenger back here you definitely can heated rear seats of course are available but not equipped on this particular vehicle we have led illumination back here and the grab handles and a very nice large panoramic sunroof as you can see in conjunction with the rear headrests it continues very very nicely in a very very beautiful view of the front dashboard alrighty the driver's door is very similarly appointed as the rear so that is good nice and soft to touch leatherette up here and the leather starts on our armrest nice wood and bright work just like out back on the handles we have the lock unlock for the door locks of course we have the window switches and our power mirror adjustments they also do our our power folding and also have powered child locks for the rear a bit more of storage up front as well and on the left of the dash we have an air vent with a nice bit of leather trimming and stitching over here we have a couple of controls to release the rear trunk and also a gauge dimmer down here we have some pretty neat looking pedals covered in rubber and our hood release right over here very nice quality to the carpeting and a jaguar dorsell just a very very beautiful color for the interior and you even get the jaguar cat embossed and the headrest lots and lots of stitching and perforations on the seat as well a very very supportive seat and of course we have all the normal controls in addition to four-way lumbar [Music] okay so here goes the key for the F Pace we have a nice Jaguar script on the rear of the key we also have the physical key on the inside in case you needed to use that we also have a lock unlock button on the top the ability to turn on the exterior lights from the key five so you kind of locate your car in a busy parking lot you can also Pop the trunk and also a panic alarm too so lots of functionalities on the key fob and it's very nice looking as well we of course have push buttons start right next to the shifter [Music] and all of the buttons so I should say a good portion of the buttons on this vehicle kind of hide away until you turn the vehicle on and then they will kind of appear with some very nice lighting um they're sort of a backlit uh almost capacitive touch button for kind of all of the buttons within the interior so let's get a focus on this beautiful looking steering wheel I really like how they continued that a beige tan color onto the steering wheel it looks very very beautiful and modern we have all of our voice command buttons as well as Bluetooth Telephone controls and all of the controls for the LCD portion of the gauge cluster in there as well we will get through how to configure that gauge cluster in just a minute and to the other side we have our heated steer wheel button which of course we will turn on we have our lane guidance control and all of our adaptive cruise control settings as well on the right side very nice large paddle shifters mounted to the steering wheel as you see couple of stalks towards the back one for your automatic lighting here turn signals as well as front and rear fog lamps we also have an informational button at the end of the stock again to configure the screen and our other stock is of course used for our front and rear wipers that brings me up to the LCD gauge cluster so a good portion of the speedometer or I should say gauge housing is an LCD screen so you can kind of see from this sort of box right here is all LCD and the rest is kind of like an analog speedometer and uh um rev counter as well so mainly we'll be using these buttons as well as the scroll wheel to configure that screen up there in addition to the button at the end of the stock so if you press that kind of various um sir trip settings mostly will pop up at the top of the dash as you see you know kind of real time miles per gallon the date and time things like that distance to empty for your fuel and all that good stuff but let's take a look at how we can configure this main screen so to start configuring you just press in the scroll wheel and then you can scroll down to sort of configure what you see in the center in a sort of main screen which is pretty neat can also scroll over to get various trip information media and audio controls various different warnings or tire pressure informations and that's pretty neat so if we go down to a kind of combination between media and driver's assistance that'll kind of change up your sort of I guess you could say home screen for the instrument cluster up here upper Dash is very nicely appointed with some stitching a couple of air vents right in the center we have the hazards button and that brings me down to our infotainment screen nice large touchscreen very clear and also very easy to get used to if you're not so familiar with the screen so first of all let's check out the navigation screen so we have the map over here and then kind of you input your destination right up top we have our phone screen as well as the radio which is kind of what is playing at the moment we have our presets and all of the stations if we scroll over it kind of um enlargens our home screen I guess you could say to a energy impact screen which is pretty neat you can kind of Select various informations towards the bottom but we have a kind of driving Style energy impact screen and I'll kind of show you what is taking up energy within your vehicle so we have the heated steering wheel on that's taken a bit and and the climate controls is taking a bit of energy this also will give you some economical tips to get you a little bit better gas mileage and you also have a history of your recent driving pretty neat screen there we can also go over to our settings where we can adjust the brightness of the gauges and the screen we have different themes so we can kind of turn it into a dark theme or kind of like automatic and we'll go with the headlights we also have the auto brake function which you can turn on and off as well as the start stop we can also adjust various things with our home screen kind of take out or add a different uh tiles there we have all of our audio settings and all of our sort of settings for the entire vehicle you can also quickly pull up our parking camera which we do have the wide angle rear view as well as the parking sensors activated so press this button over here which will kind of give us a jumpilation of our apps one more thing I wanted to show you was the cabin lighting screen and this is where you kind of configure your ambient Lighting in this vehicle so very neat sort of uh sort of shows that or pictures that go along with each color and you can also kind of create your own color with the ambient lighting so pretty neat there going back and activate various things like your valet mode get some economical driving data your voice commands and things like that we also have a all-service information kind of shows you what the all-wheel drive system is doing in real time and then this also gives you sort of information based upon each driving mode this vehicle has get into that in just a minute but that pretty much does it for the main screen very easy to get used to you know you can't get lost in all the menus and things like that like some other infotainment screens but nonetheless very nice looking and very functional down here of course we have our Dual Zone climate control so we have these two knobs which are multi-function so just as is you can turn them and it will adjust your temperature if you press them in that will control your heated seats on this reticular car or if it was equipped it will cooled with will also function with the cooled seats pushing it again back to our temperatures and if you pull it towards you that will adjust your fan speed pretty neat solution to kind of clean up the climate control but still very easy to get used to right over here we have our seat heating screen so if you didn't want to press the knob in you just kind of pull it up here we also have an automatic function and sync for the climate control over there very nice heated windscreen which is a very very nice feature to have in the winter especially up here in New England of course the defroster for the rear and your AC settings and the front defrost as well down here we have a wireless charging pad for your phone this brings me down to a small Center stack here which is a few buttons it of course has that start stop button the audio volume knob which is pretty neatly styled and this is our gear selector again for that eight speed automatic so it's kind of like a suede material with some stitching there's an unlock at the back and you could press it forward for reverse which of course will activate your reversing camera with the guidance lines and all the way down into drive you can also bump it over like so into a sport mode and that is when you can start shifting with your paddle shifters there and then we also have a nice big p for Park pretty cool solution here for the driving modes you kind of press this button in and that will kind of activate your different driving modes in the center cluster so of course we have a dynamic normal comfort and the Eco and then sort of a rain ice and snow mode which is pretty cool so we kind of leave it into comfort for now and push the button right back in so it's either side of mind we also have a sort of uh button right here to uh sort of like a hill descent control and we can also turn on and off your attraction control over here we can slide this back and we have a couple of nicely sized cup holders and also stand up your phone right in here a little uh tray right here to put various smaller objects maybe lose change and things like that I have a 12 volt power outlet and a pretty nice center console lid you can lift that up you can see we have all the connections available to you in this in the vehicle so we have a good combination of 12 volt power outlets they also have a normal style USB and a USBC with a pretty deep storage console in there and that brings me over to the passenger area they have a nice slab of the leather and wood trim and a lockable glove box open that it's kind of a bin style and pretty good amount of room in there it's all felt lined with a pen holder too take a look towards the top we have our frameless rear view mirror with the garage door Home links you have three of those and up at our Center stack we have a couple of buttons up here for the sunroof and sun shade so two separate buttons for both so we could see the sun shade does open very nicely that's a little bit I would say it's more translucent that's a little bit of light in and will roll all the way back with a sunglass storage back here and the other button is used to vent or slide back the glass board of the sunroof there's some various controls to either side over here like an SOS button also like a sort of a maintenance button we also have led tap lights on the interior too and now that the sun shade has opened completely with a very large section up front that opens and a nice smaller section for the rear passengers to round things off we of course have these sun visors you can't forget about that they have the card holders and a mirror and Light but that pretty much does it for the features section of this review let's get it out on the road and see how it drives all righty let's see what it's like to drive the Jaguar f-pace really really beautiful vehicle I'm thoroughly impressed with this car just the way it looks and the color combination on this car kind of a sucker for dark blue exteriors and a nice tan or brown Interiors so we do have a nice little driving route planned out for you not a very large test drive since we are in a city setting uh the capital of Connecticut we are in Hartford so lots of City driving going around around here but that is good for you guys then uh do live around the city or in the city uh every once in a while so you get to see how this car is light to light we'll also get an acceleration clip and kind of get a good feel on how it handles now right off the bat this car does ride a very nice just taking it over the smaller bumps down here uh you know the the suspension soaks them up very nicely and already I could tell this is more of a comfort rather than sport uh tuned suspension now the seats too are very comfortable we have four-way lumbar which helps out with that Comfort level and the Turbo 4 seems to have pretty good load down power and is also very quiet and smooth I have to say that the eight-speed transmission is definitely helping out with that smoothness as well you barely hear the four cylinder upon acceleration which is pretty awesome it's almost non-existent the the gasoline mode almost feels like you're driving an electric car when you're just coasting because you don't hear the gasoline engine whatsoever and you also really don't feel anything at all you know even on an idle you know most the time you know with any other car you'll get a very subtle vibration but you know even on this just holding onto the steering wheel or holding onto anything in the interior it is just a very smooth four-cylinder anyway we go steering actually has a pretty quick ratio too which is pretty nice for the city and also the back roads you can kind of carve along on the fun sort of turns and whatnot I am kind of Blown Away by just how quiet is in here there's really you know up at 45 to 50 miles an hour there is virtually no tire noise put it down into the dynamic mode and we will get an acceleration clip get it to 25 miles an hour and kind of mash the throttle that way we'll see how fast the transmission reacts and how fast it can get up to speed so we are at 25 and yeah so really pretty Swift acceleration from this f-pace with the 2-liter turbo a nice little corner here yeah definitely a pretty direct steering for this car and uh the suspension does hold its own switch it back to comfort so yeah pretty impressed with the acceleration uh you know the eight speed did a quick enough job of switching up our gears so that we are in the Power Band and uh you know other other SUVs in this segment might have a little bit more horsepower uh but I can tell you that the 247 this car produces is plenty uh for me at least and if it's not for you then the I also have the turbocharged in line six and The Supercharged V8 on top of this engine Choice uh which uh should definitely suit anybody's needs but uh yeah to wrap up the F Pace I really really do like this car and the overall design on the exterior looks very sporty and classy and the same thing with the interior uh just looking at this steering wheel it's just probably one of the most beautiful steering wheels on the market especially with that color matching the interior color of this car but yeah plenty of features uh plenty of power and very impressive Dynamics out on the road so you know the fast steering and the very quiet engine and the very quiet ride too so yeah pretty impressive all the way around with this f-pace to round out the video I hope you have enjoyed the f-pace just as much as I have and I also hope you stay with us here at tide drives for more videos just like this one
75;Jaguar;2023 F-Pace;Jaguar F-Pace SVR Long-Term Review | Six things to know before buying;"Jaguar is going all in on electrification
it's i-pace SUV was way ahead of the curve back in 2018 Formula E is its only Factory
Motorsport program and it plans to become a fully electric brand by 2025. [Music] SBR and it's the hottest version of Jaguar's
biggest and best SUV you get a Supercharged V8 engine indulgent leather interior and a
super agile chassis that's stickier than a just stop oil protester with a two for one
on the super glue a festival car isn't just borrowing this one for a week we've had it
on our long term Fleet for over 6 000 miles now so that means we're not just dealing with
the honeymoon period here we can really dig in to the day-to-day get down to that nitty-gritty
what this car is like to live with so if you're a hot Prospect for the FPS svr here are six
things I think you'll want answering so do I have to buy the facelift well the
svr came out in 2018 and when it did we read it really highly but things have moved on
since then and in 2021 we got the facelift and with that you did get a lot of worthwhile
upgrades Under the Skin you get re-tuned dampers and a tweaked edif plus a new steering rack
brake booster and some suspension Hardware including different bushes the five liter
Supercharged V8 doesn't get any extra power but it still makes 542 brake horsepower and
this 15 pound foot of extra torque for 516 pound foot all in there's also a tougher torque
converter on the project 8 Saloon and that actually drops the note to 60 from 4.1 to
3.8 seconds I think the biggest reason to go for the facelift
though is the new infotainment system which we'll get onto in a minute but don't dismiss
the pre-facelift cars I went on a well-known classified site there's 43 of them available
and they start from 50 000 pounds with around 20 000 miles on so give them these cars now
start from 85 000 that is really good value so is it fast and is the mpg really terrible
well fast yes it is this is an extremely rapid car is the mpg terrible well that depends
what your expectations are let's start with the five liter Supercharged
V8 it is the Zenith of jaguars AJ V8 engine and all other unit designed by Jaguar before
Ford bought the company it used to be made at Ford's Bridge end assembly plant it's now
produced in-house by jlr and it's been the main state of Jaguar at Land Rover performance
cars for what seems like forever debuted in the XK of 1996 and in a marriage made in heaven
the Eaton supercharger free to SBR models like ours slots perfectly between the 90 degree
V like a cricket ball caught by two cup tans in the f-based SBR it makes 542 brake horsepower
with 516 pound foot spread from 3500 to 5000 RPM Jaguar of course will have plans to give
this engine a send-off and exactly what that will be remains to be seen but we do know
that this will be the last series production Jaguar Land Rover model to be fitted with
the AJ V8 I think there's a tendency with this engine
because it's been around for so long to kind of dismiss it as old ha old Tech but I really
like this engine I think it's fantastic I don't just think it's one of the great engines
of our time I think it's one of the greatest engines of all time starts up it's really
kind of raucous got a load of attitude really sort of muscle car Rumble to it and then it
quietens down and when you're around town it's got a kind of Rich indulgent really kind
of flexible feel to it that really suits a luxurious SUV now Pig talk doesn't come in
till 3500 RPM which sounds pretty high these days but because this engine is supercharged
that is just instant response and you just feel like this car is always eager always
ready to go and it just adds to the kind of effortless feel as you drive it around town
the other thing is is the noise and it really brought it home to me when I was watching
the new Range Rover Sport SV which has gone to the BMW V8 engine and switched from this
engine basically and you know it sounds like a much more digital kind of enhanced sort
of engine and it does sound like a BMW engine stuck in a Range Rover I think from what I've
heard so far and it just reminded me that we are really Gonna Miss This engine when
it's gone or I certainly am but then you can switch it into Dynamic mode on this dial here
dials up all the exhaust noise gives you more throttle response and also things like steering
weight and so on and I pull it back this lever here into into manual mode to get control
of the gear shift and it suddenly snaps alive and starts to feel like a much more kind of
aggressive more involving sort of car and it sends 90 of the torque to the back by the
way so those gear shifts that were refined before and really starting to slap now but
you do get that census eight gears raw quite closely stacked and that kind of Relentless
delivery is just the power just keeps on coming so fourth into fifth so even though the power
band is relatively now it's not too bad but it stops revving really stops pulling at what
seven two something like that you know it's just this sense that it's just coming all
the time and really kind of leaning back and and firing at the Horizon so in terms of MPG
officially it's 23.1 MPG and actually I've been getting pretty close to that with a mix
of town runs uh Motorway runs to the airport things like that so low 20s 21 22 maybe I
was pretty happy with that given my sort of driving but then a car reader got in touch
Peter Heming he's bought one and he says he's getting 28 to 31 out of his at the moment
which you know he must be absolutely stroking it along but fair play that's really good
MPG for an engine that's as exciting as this but who knows maybe you know I'm sure this
will go out with some kind of tear-jerking send-off maybe in an f-based svr maybe some
special project overall though I love this poetry and who
knows maybe the h8 V8 will be a crate engine like a Chevy LS once Jack retires it it's
relatively light it's Compact and it's durable too and I wonder if you could fit one in an
eyepiece now that would be fun [Music] like a Jaguar it should well that's another
big question this is you know it's an SUV it weighs just over two tons so it's not a
sports car or a sports Saloon and that's what Jaguar really cut its teeth on and what it
forged that reputation for ride and handling Excellence but I would say a lot of that Jaguar
character does bubble to the surface here and it's for a lot of different reasons you
know it does ride well I think it's steering you know the front end grip it's not you know
crazy front end grip but it's got a very very strong front end for a big heavy SUV with
that five liter Supercharged V8 in the nose body control the way it leans into that corner
but but kind of controls its mass and is predictable with it rather than getting in some nasty
tank slapper I think that's really confidence inspiring as well a couple of areas where
it can fall down are in town it can feel a little bit tough in town but once you're up
to speed it rides really nicely it breathes unless you're on a very heavily cambered B
road which you can get in the UK okay not so much here although you can see it there
rocking about a little bit and that's because this car is coils and anti-roll bars rather
than say a Range Rover Sport svr with air Springs where you know it can isolate that
you can use active roll control instead of anti-roll bars that have a physical connection
so you know cambered roads in town it can feel a little bit tougher but you know generally
the balance this car strikes with you know ride handling refinement I think it's a really
nice balance so we've got 90 of the power going to the rear wheels in Dynamic mode so
it's all-wheel drive 90 of the power and if we sweep into here you can just see how you
can promote a bit of a slide you can you know not in a silly way but just to tuck it into
the corner and make it feel like it's it's going in a direction you want it to but it
stops short of being kind of you know a bit ludicrous and a bit wild like the f-pace or
the F Type R as much as I like that car this is a car where you can dig into the power
more and use it with more confidence so all in the ride the handling the luxury of this
car I think it works really well the other thing is is the steering and and that's really
good in this car I would say you know for a two-ton SUV that needs to be isolated and
comfortable and refined it does a really good job of keying you into the surface of letting
you know what's going on at ground level it's nicely weighted as well you know it's not
too light in Comfort is maybe a bit too light but I've got in Dynamic here it adds a bit
of extra heft and it just really makes you you know feel at the core of the action and
confident to Chuck what is a pretty big and tall car around and enjoy it as well the other
thing I'd say that feeds into all that kind of feel as you're driving it is the brake
pedal so that the facelift got the enhanced brake booster I think most of the time it
works really well but there are moments where it feels over servoed a bit over responsive
and particularly at slower speeds but if I dip into it here just nice and firm reassuring
and you know overall the way this car handles the way it mixes kind of really engaging handling
with comfort and luxury I think it works really well so one of the big reasons to buy the svr if
not the biggest reason to buy is this new pivy Pro infotainment system it's a new 11.4
inch screen looks much more modern than the system that went before even if it could be
a bit more neatly integrated into the design so I do find it intuitive to use you've got
these three tiles that have got some of your key shortcut functions like navigation phone
and media here if we're going to navigation easily set your destination we go into the
radio I've got it set to six music but you can easily swipe through all your other stations
but touch screens can be a bit distracting or very distracting at times so I'm very pleased
that we've got the touch control here voice control and you can you know program your
navigation through that or choose to change the radio station and if these three tiles
aren't what you need then you can dig a little bit deeper into these functions down here
so you can see we've got things like apple carplay we've got all surface information
about what the car is doing when you're off-road and also importantly Dynamic I so normally
you're tweaking the cars modes here here but this Dynamic mode you can shift to your own
kind of personal taste so for instance I've got everything in Dynamic except for the suspension
which I've put into the Comfort mode with the facelift and this redesign you also get
these new climate controls which are very much like the ones in the Range Rover Velar
and what I like about these you get the digital display they look very modern and fresh again
but they're also they're an analog dial so you can feel them they're nicely knurled so
if you're in a kind of you know you're getting overloaded and you're on the road you can
just turn down the temperature really quickly they are kind of multifunctional in that you
pull them out to change the fan and you push them in again to change the cooled and heated
seats which I really like as well but when I lend this car out to people it generally
comes back with something like the heat cranked up or the blower going too much and they've
got a bit mixed up but personally I find this quite easy to use and the last thing you also
get is this new redesigned gear shifter now it's not as bad as the things in the 911 and
the golf which are really fiddly little little gear knobs but it's not as good as the previous
p pistol grip shifter which was a little bit taller and that's for two reasons now firstly
it's because I find it a little bit slow to respond so if you're taken out of park and
into drive it doesn't always respond and that's not a problem when you're moving away from
a parking space but when you're at the traffic lights it always discourages me from from
taking it out of drive and put it in park and you can't knock it over to the left to
select manual and again when you're sort of on the road you want to select manual I find
that really intuitive on this you have to pull it give it kind of double pull back and
then check on the dash that you've got it but overall I think this is a big Improvement
on what went before so which options do I need well when this
car was built it's a 72 plate it costs 81 500 pounds and that Jaguar added almost 8
000 pounds worth of options and that took the final price of this car to 89 370 pounds
but since then Jaguar has rejigged the pricing structure so the svr now starts from 85 180
pounds but you do get a lot more standard equipment and the net result is this car as
specs costs 87 940 pounds and it's cheaper than it was before so it depends whether you're buying your facelift
svr new or used and 21 to 72 plate cars like cars could have a less generous specification
kit that was previously optional and is now standard includes 22 inch Alloys they were
previously 900 pounds gloss black exterior trim for everything from the badging to the
Bonnet vents that used to be 1250 pounds the Meridian Surround Sound audio that was 420
pounds and the fixed panoramic roof that was 1275 pounds this one's fixed but there's now
an optional sliding roof and that's currently 350 pounds these performances are standard
now but they come with suede cloth inserts but you still have to pay 1100 pounds extra
to get them in semi-aniline leather like ours head-up display is also still optional that's
830 pounds I've got an extremely active lifestyle I go base jumping a free solo any rock face
I can find in the East Midlands but I also like the inflatables at Rutland Aqua Park
the last time I was there I used this really useful option actually it's 325 pounds at
the moment it's the activity key what it means is you can lock away your key in the glove
box or even leave it at home lock your valuables inside the car and then just jump in the water
you have to worry about putting the key in a changing room or something so if you've
got an active lifestyle like me you might want to consider the activity key how does it compare with Rivals well that
is the big one isn't it should you buy this car versus Rivals but when I first group tested
the fbase SBR when it came out 2021 we had three other cars and I did put it in first
position so we had the x6m BMW and we also had the Audi rsq8 now those were the most comparable cars to
the f-pace but they're about 50 brake horsepower more powerful they're a lot heavier and also
there were well over a hundred thousand pounds as well the other car in that group test was
the KN Coupe S now that was more comparable on price but that made 470 brake horsepower
so it was a good bit down on the FPS svr so it was actually quite truly positioned now
the f-base is about 77 millimeters shorter I think than the KN but its wheelbase is only
21 millimeters shorter so when you look in the back there's actually plenty of space
I've got a couple of teenage kids they're fine back there and also the boot is more
spacious than the KN as well so I think all round is an all-round package performance
price practicality actually it Stacks up really well the other thing I did was I did a job
with this car recently for for car magazine I went to visit a Jaguar collector who let's
face it had an awful lot of money and he'd actually dismissed a Range Rover Sport SBR
not because it's a bit yobby but which I don't think is yobbier than this car but because
he just thought it was too much money even they had the funds to buy it but when I let
him drive this he really really liked it he thought he may well buy it and he thought
it was good value in the context at this Market as well [Music] so there you have it over
6 000 highly contented miles in the Jaguar f-pace svr I like the engine like the handling
the design and I like the refinement of this car I also like the fact you're unlikely to
see another which can't be said but it's Sibley the Range Rover svr I've seen one other f-based
svr and I was so surprised I actually stopped to video it nothing has gone wrong during
our time with this car I still enjoy driving it very much that all those miles have turned
up a few floors I didn't notice on first acquaintance but two years since I first tested it against
the German opposition it's to take the Jaguar f-pace svr over them all [Applause] [Music]
foreign [Music]"
76;Jaguar;2021 I-Pace;Jaguar I-Pace 2021 SUV: In-depth review road test with Ginny Buckley / Electrifying.com;there are Award winners and then as this car junkie was first all-electric model the ipace which is 160 - that's 62 awards including managing an unprecedented travel at the World Car of the Year awards that design Car of the Year Green Car of the Year as well as the top spot world Car of the Year the first ever cars to clock up three awards in one go and the first ever EB to win the overall title that's really quite a list isn't it so I guess it's safe to say that it's probably pretty good well spoiler alert yes yes it is it is brilliant in fact but before I tell you what's so good about it don't forget to subscribe to the channel then you get a notification when the latest video from Tom Nikki and I has landed and please come and say hello to us over at electrifying calm so the jugular ipace an SUV that defies convention and in all the best ways first of all does the way it looks it's an SUV but not a tall one it's more slinky than that it looks modern and classy a bit like a subtle spaceship Jaguar embraced the opportunity when it came to making their very first electric car and produce something quite radical that somehow still manages to look like a Jag which takes someone as clever as its designer Ian Callum to pull it off I mean just look at it there is so much that I love about this car I adore its side profile swooping arch on the top there and I like the way the handles just pop elegantly in and out to the doors and I do think it looks great with massive wheels the bigger the better and these are huge designer wheels aren't they and at the front here the low nose and then the way that the wheel arches just sweep a little bit gives it a real purposeful look I don't even get me started on that massive vent there which again just looks fantastic the whole thing is really modern and interesting without ever being flashy and the thing I like the most about it is that every time I see it I think it looks even better it's one of those cars that might be tonight a couple of years old now but still looks fresh and it looks really modern and it's the same here on the inside just really thoughtful elegant design without too much shouting us this is definitely not in-your-face design which I like a lot I like the floating console here with the gap at the back and the handy storage compartments they're great for keeping your phone completely out of the way when you're driving and there's just loads of nice little details in here and you know what people the details really make the difference because this is where you spend all your time not looking at it from the outside the seats are very comfortable with plenty of adjustments and the seating position is nice and raised but not too high I mean generally in here is just a lovely place to be there are two touchscreens a 10-inch one here and a five inch version just underneath jankier calls it touch pro duo and it works pretty well most of the time it can get a little laggy sometimes a common criticism of janky was entertainment but it's not a deal-breaker then as a twelve point three inch screen right in front and that can be set up to show pretty much anything you want it to from sat-nav instructions to Spotify playlists it is a bit clunky and fiddly to navigate though and the first time I drove it it took me absolutely ages to get my head around how the climate control was operated safe to say intuitive it isn't so looks great it has a beautiful interior but you know what the best bit is the way it drives [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now the ipace is classed as an SUV but it isn't really it feels far lower than that because it actually is and in fact I think it's a mistake to really try and classify this car the battery is in a traditional skateboard arrangement now that one is where the engineers load the heavy batteries in the floor of the car between the wheels to keep the center of gravity low so it has a motor on each axle and it's also got all-wheel drive and weight distribution is roughly 50/50 which is very good news for balance which in turn is very good news from one of my absolute favorite things about the ipace the way it goes and corners just sticks to the road beautifully this thing just works I've driven this car a lot and it takes me roughly oh I don't know 10 seconds behind the wheel to remind me exactly why it has picked up all those awards there's only one model available the Eevee 400 but that comes in three specs s SE and HSE so that means you get just one size of battery a fairly big 90 kilowatt unit and one power output just with three different levels of luxury the other thing to say is that it is definitely not slow even by the standards an electric car which are notoriously very quick off the mark it's a car that's true to Jagua sporting DNA it really doesn't disappoint using its at 396 horsepower and 513 pounds of torque to hit 62 in just under 5 seconds top speed is a hundred and twenty-four miles per hour but that's not really the point because it's the way that the only pace manages to pull out for a quick overtake or accelerate onto a motorway sliprock that just really impressive it means pulling out of a Junction and getting up to speed it's just a near-instant operation and it is the kind of thing that as a driver just gives you loads of confidence particularly in bad conditions when you throw the all-wheel drive into the mix it's got the kind of real world punch that makes traditional sports car owners really get quite annoyed but the best bit is that this is an Eevee that actually drives like you're supposed to enjoy it like you're supposed to love it of course most TVs do feel fast from a standstill but they can also feel just a little bit numb not with the eye pace it really is a standout in this price range at the moment you can have to pay way way more for a portrait icon to get anywhere near this level of fun from a pure electric vehicle it's not all good news though the claimed range is some 292 miles but to be honest we've struggled to get anywhere near that that figure is the absolute best case scenario based on a car with all the lightest options available and really good weather conditions the kind that just are optimum for a battery a loaded car has a predicted range of 258 miles but even so if you want to stay comfortable warm or cool listen to music just kind of you know go about your business enjoying the car and you're probably looking at sticking to a couple of hundred miles without charging I mean saying that Jack Hewitt has offered a complimentary update to the IPAs so that upgrading cars are offer over-the-air updates and on with a tweaked program for the battery it gives you all the other 10 miles or so of pure electric range on a full charge now that constant evolution is one of the real benefits for pure Eevee and its really good to see that jankura is getting in on the over-the-air action in fact there are loads of neat but subtle touches you can precondition the battery and heat or cool the cabin when it's charging before you get in by using the app on the smartphone and that happens without depleting any of the charge it switches off the air vents if it knows it there's nobody sitting in the seat to appreciate them and it can be programmed to automatically change the car settings depending on which key is being used and this is all very good stuff so what about its rivals will you be Duff not to look Tesla's way the model 3 is a little smaller less expensive the Model S is a bit bigger they both though do a starling job you should also check out our videos of the Audi e-tron and Mercedes EQ see if you want something more traditionally SUV shaped I guess a bit more traditional all around really the eye pace is a serious bit of kit you know I go so far as to say that this is the best car that Jaguar make it looks fantastic it's forward-thinking it's brilliant to drive yes it would be good if the range wasn't quite so optimistic and that infotainment system could probably do with an upgrade but really it's well worthy of all those awards it's won every 62 of them [Music] you
77;Jaguar;2021 I-Pace;Jaguar I-Pace SUV 2021 technology review - Tomis Tech Download / Electrifying;[Applause] [Music] this is the 2021 jaguar eye pace and jaguar has done so many things right with this all-electric suv it's won so many awards especially for its design but can we say the same about the tech inside especially since they haven't updated one of the parts that people didn't like before i tell you what that is make sure you subscribe to electrifying.com for more videos like this and every time we upload a new video so you get notified so the i-pace comes with a lot of the features we've come to expect from electric cars these days for example you can remote lock it using a phone app you can precondition the car so for example when it's winter you can pre-heat the car before you get in and you can even set it to be cool for summer times but talking about apps though when you go for the app store there's so many different apps available from jaguar that sometimes it can be confusing figuring out which one you actually need to download having said that though when you set up a new profile on here it actually tells you gives you a link to download the latest and most up-to-date application for your smartphone it's available on ios and android as well so you're in luck if you have either of those devices the ipace has been updated with the latest pv pro infotainment system so with the instrument cluster for the driver you have a 12.3 inch display which is nice and big you can see everything visibly and you can even edit the layout so you can change what you actually see on there what's important to you one thing i wish they did differently here though is something that audi does very well so for example to change the view to change the view layout so you have to go into settings on there and scroll through and eventually you update the settings and the layout but for me in an audi at the touch of a button you can change the view to suit whether you're trying to be eco-friendly or you're trying to put your foot down so you can see all the speed and the lighting changes and everything on here though is where everything else happens so on the climate control area you have a five inch display which is also touch screen and is a combination of a very responsive dial here as well but the first thing you notice though is when you're trying to use this for the first time it can get a little bit confusing can get a little bit tricky but once you figure it out it's very straightforward you have a push to pull system with this rotary dial system so for example you pull to change the temperature you push it down to change the fan and you know the intensity of the fan in the car and then the touchscreen area is where you control your climate entirely so for example you can turn it on and you can put smart climate on as well but what i really like though are two things you have purifying which means you can purify the air that comes inside the car or inside the car already you also have to ionize in setting as well so come summer for me for example when there's pollen everywhere it means that gets filtered out before it gets in the car and i'm not affected i'm not going to be sneezing throughout my journey so it's a lot more comfortable for myself and the passengers in the car as well also below the climate control area you have a wireless charging mat which is which comes as an option by the way is not standard in the eye pace but one thing i find about that space is trying to get your phone to actually sit in there comfortably depending on which size phone you have so you either fit it from this side it's a little gap on the floating console here and you you get your phone in there and it starts charging and then it gets a bit awkward trying to get the phone out at the same time so i'm not sure what jaguar we're thinking when it comes to the design of where that wireless charging mac goes behind here we have a two usb ports there so there's a usbc port and a full usb as well which i quite like i like this that's still stuck to the full usb-a as well because some of us still use uh the good old usb-a charging cables and talking about that you can use that to connect to your iphone as well or your android device and you have apple carplay or android auto available there as well onto the main infotainment system you have different profiles available so you can add multiple people to use the car things like vehicle settings climate control settings can be assigned to them so in my settings my seat settings is assigned to me every time i get inside of the car elsewhere we have things like camera so we have a 360 degree camera in the car zone we can view our surroundings and it also helps with parking the car as well or when traveling at low speeds it also activates sometimes but maybe if you roll back a little bit it will activate just to allow you to see your surroundings which is good for safety purposes the icons are nicely laid out as well the very simple and minimalist i love the design of it you can even edit this so that you can arrange it to your preference as well so if we swipe across you can see your settings options here so you can do things like change screen brightness the home layout so at the moment i've got icons as my own layout you can also have different tiles as well in terms of home layout but if we go further into home screen here we then have more option to do to edit those things so here again you got app tiles or app icons and you can edit that layout itself so if you have tiles for example at the moment we have ev driving style uh energy impact navigation phone and media uh so there's right at the top there you can see where they are but what we can do is then drag another one like so so we can stick ev there we can have driving style energy impact see nice and easy to use just like you would on your smartphone once you've configured your tiles you can then go back to the home screen and see the layout so then you can swipe across when it does actually work so this takes me onto the next bit which is that one thing i mentioned at the start that they still haven't really improved on jaguar said this is meant to be intuitive like you would on your smartphone so things like swiping across should be nice and fluid but sometimes it's just a bit laggy nothing's happening nothing's happening and then bam it happens imagine when you're driving and you're trying to swipe across to quickly select something that can be really annoying and that can be distracting when you're trying to keep your focus on the road are there many options that you have there to do with the electricity and you know energy consumption you have the ev menu which is very important so if we tap that you can see your charging information and your preferred charging period as well so at the moment it tells me i've got 48 battery left and my predicted range as well if we go into energy that then tells me my energy consumption as well which can be useful for you to be able to improve your driving style and all that stuff in here we have vehicle preconditioning as well so if we select that you can set things like when you depart and when you get back home as well so you can get the car warmed up you can preheat the battery and all that stuff next we have eco data so inside ecodata it gives you more detail about your drive style and range impact and all that stuff i really like this i'm i'm a nerd when it comes to data so when it comes to this you can see your drive star you can see duration of when i've been driving range impacts in terms of things in the inside the car like the ac the the screen heating and the steering wheel heating and seat eating as well so if i put those things on it will tell me how they impact the range i've got left in the car if you're going to eco tips it then gives you some tips on how to save range and what you can do to you know to add a bit more range to your journey which is pretty cool and then if you go into history you can see how well you've done over time again more data for you to improve your drive style and not only save the environment but also save on when it comes to range that you've got left on the car next we have voice so the same way you can control different things in the car using the rotary dials and the touch screen and stuff you can also use your voice as well inside voice you have your climate commands phone commands and if you have your apple device connected for example you can use it to control siri for example which is pretty neat to have inside of the car right you've also got settings in there which allows you to set a wake up word so the same way you use your google assistant at home or amazon alexa devices you can also do that here so we can say something like hey jaguar when he works here jaguar hey jaguar go to buckingham palace sorry i'm a stat you can also say help for further assistance go to buckingham palace choose a line number two [Music] voila so there you have it once you tell it where you want to go it sets the destination and then we can go from there speaking of maps with the pv pro uh new pvp pro infotainment system what you also get with the map is it's very ev friendly so it sets the destination it navigates you with ev charging stations in mind so the best ones to make sure that you charge very quickly and also make sure that you get there safely and back safely as well without worrying about the range in the car although you have an ev-friendly maps there one thing i do find those i still find myself connect to my phone to use google maps and the reason why that is is for basic traffic information i find google maps a lot more up-to-date for example the other day when i was driving there was a roadblock this app navigation here in the car did not find a way to reroute me to find a different way alternative route so i kept going around in circles until i got my phone connected again and google maps was able to reroute me and find me a better route to get home next we have media so this is where the magic happens and i keep myself entertained in the car so you can connect up to two devices at the same time using bluetooth in the car or if you want to use apple car play when you don't want to do dab radio fm radio etc you can simply connect using your own usb cable connect it to the car and you get access to apple carplay so your interface moves over to the big screen and then you can control things like your music google maps and so on so you can see they get access to your calendar your schedule for the day and this is where i use my google maps because it's just a lot more easier for me to do so another smart thing about the navigation in the car is being able to actually find parking spaces very easily as well so the sat nav can actually find the nearest parking stations and where you can park that's optimal to your destination and also when it comes to paying for parking you can actually do that in the car without leaving the car there's a park and pay menu so you just have to link your profile to your parking provider for example there's a ring going here and using that you can pay for parking right in the car without having to leave the car connectivity and entertainment and all that though it's not just geared towards the driver it's also geared towards the passengers in the car as well for example you get 4g wi-fi hotspots so we can connect up to eight devices to the car and access the internet so if you have passengers in the backseat working away on the laptop they can connect on the go and actually access the internet as well on the back you also get two usbc ports so if they want to connect their phones or and charge their devices they can also do that in the car one thing that doesn't get mentioned a lot quite often when it comes to cars is artificial intelligence so jaguar uses ai in the i-pace to basically calculate the most accurate range in the car based on key factors like climate the temperature your drive style the road conditions and using those settings as well they can also automate the mundane tasks for example you can even automatically adjust the seat settings to your preference based on those key factors as well which i find really amazing it just means the car is thinking of you and based on your journeys it learns over time the car becomes a bit a bit like an extension of you you get more comfortable when you're driving and that's amazing last but not least is also software over-the-air updates what that means is basically wirelessly jaguar can send updates to the ipace so it just saves you the trip to the local dealership so you don't have to keep going back for updates everything just gets updated again taking us into the future [Music] self-driving options are quite limited in the i-pace although you get plenty of safety options like lane keep assist you also get things like rear traffic alerts and emergency braking even front collision warning as well you get emergency braking in general which are quite great for keeping yourself safe and secure on the road you also get uh fatigue alerts as well so if the driver is tired any senses that you're driving in a very tired manner it sort of alerts you lets you know that you need to wake up and keep your eyes on the road and hands on the steering whilst driving though what i also love is that head mirror that digital head mirror so using the hd camera on the back uh that's integrated on the fin of the antenna on the back and that ultra wide angle lens just gives you a clear vision of what's going on behind the car and what's great about that though is the fact that everyone that's sat in the back if they're tall or short or whatever it means they won't be blocking your vision or peripherals for the parents out there though who likes to keep an eye on the kids at the back or if you have a pet and you want to keep an eye on them at the back you won't be able to do that with a digital camera but what you can do though is switch it off i'll flick at the toggle and that way you can just quickly see what's going on and it's back to just your regular mirror one thing i do find though is once you switch it off the switch between going from digital to manual or your regular mode goes a bit darker which means your vision have to quickly adjust to what's going on uh behind you when it comes to the music in the car and sound quality it sounds amazing too you have meridian audio installed in the car already which sounds great you got the woofer doing all the bass and the twitter's helping with the mids as well and voice clarity as well so if you're listening to a podcast in the car you'll be able to hear the voice clearly with no issues at all but there are a few things i would change though in terms of how responsive the display the infotainment system is for example so when you're swiping across sometimes it freezes it lags and sometimes as well what you get is with the digital head mirror as much as i love it the switch between bright light situation and when it goes darker it doesn't do it instantaneously so sometimes it's a bit jarring to the eyes but apart from that i think overall jagger's done a good job here so there you have it that's the gadgets boy tech rundown of the new jaguar i-pace as always if you want to see the full review of the i-pace check out

78;Jaguar;2021 I-Pace;"Is the 2021 I-Pace good enough to lead Jaguar to ""EV only"" by 2025 ?! [Road Test]";hey guys and welcome to petrol ped now recently jaguar announced that from 2025 they will cease production of all petrol and diesel vehicles and only make electric cars now behind me is the new 2021 jaguar i-pace the only electric car they currently make it best be good [Music] now this is actually the second time i've had an eye pace on the channel i drove on a couple of years ago not long after they launched and it impressed me a great deal i don't think it's a massive secret that i've got a bit of a soft spot for the i-pace for me i think it's i think it's one of the best-looking cars that jaguar make and it's certainly right up there in terms of one of the best-looking evs that you can buy and i know looks are very subjective but this ticks a lot of boxes for me i think the front of the car is so sleek i've always liked the headlamp design and interestingly if you look at the new f-type i think a lot of i-pace has gone into f-type but i've always loved the way that the air is sculpted at the front you've got this intake here that comes through and then out here to if you like airflow management around the front of the car to help reduce its drag coefficient and so on now this is the new demonstrator for my good friends at harwood's jaguar chichester and they emailed me a couple of weeks ago and said look head we've got the new i-pace in we think you'll like it it's got some really interesting updates especially to do with the satnav and mmi which i'll get onto very shortly but look at it from a spec point of view this dark blue color with the black wheels just looks beautiful the interior is very light and very airy not sure how much i could live with those white seats but they do look really nice and then you walk down the side of the car and it's just got lovely lines and i get to the back of the car the back's lovely so where do i start with the back well i'm going to start where the airwood and that's through this kind of roof spoiler here sets the top of the car off beautifully privacy glass i'm always a big fan of privacy glass but the back of the car the way this car's been spec with the slight tint in the rear lights the blacked out badge work i love the diffuser section there it just looks brilliant from the back for me really really like it a great deal and then in terms of boot space do you know what it's not too bad obviously i've got the obligatory charge cable just lying there but there is some underfloor storage not a great deal i'd put the charge cable in there if this were my car obviously but it's plenty big enough especially for a couple of dogs it's quite tempting as a proposition this car i have to say so yeah you would think that with that sloping roof line the boot space might be compromised a little bit but it's not see like in the back rear passenger love those handles not bad um i've got a fair amount of leg room as i always say in these videos that seat is set for me as a driver i have long legs and i've got a reasonable amount of leg room i don't know how i would classify this car whether it's a kind of compact suv size it's it's not quite like that but it is very nice in here now this car has been spec with this full glass roof which just gives so much light in here but it also gives a little bit extra headroom and i've got plenty of headroom i've got some little lighting controls up here there is a rear parcel shelf there for the rear i don't think you'll get much on there and you've got heated seats in the back of this particular hse trim spec i've got a couple of charge ports and a 12 volt socket it's nice guessing this is some nice little uh yeah i could i could quite easily sit in here for a long journey it's really nice let's have a sit where the action happens at the front oh no bad news child locks bump finally managed to get myself out the back of the car note to self check that the child locks aren't on next time pet but anyway welcome to the interior the new 2021 jaguar i-pace let me just fire the car up um to show you the displays first things first i'm a big fan of the way this car is laid out on the inside the choice of materials is excellent this is the hse spec so it's their highest level of spec and you can tell it's a premium premium product in here but there are things that have been done in this car that i just really like that are just a bit different from other cars that i've driven for example you've got this big wide screen here with all of your different um sat nav audio and other vehicle controls i love the fact it's got a white backlight and the font choice and just the really nice it's it's really very very easy to use there's a lot of touch screen in here but then most evs have that and there's lots of information that you can delve into in this car you could spend a lot of time just playing with all the different controls a couple of things i do like there's an eco data screen so this car will help you try and improve your driving style and what's really nice is the range prediction will change dependent upon the things that you're using in the car so for example this car's got heated searing wheel or heated seats you put those on it's going to hamper the rain slightly and that will be reflected on here it even gives you eco tips on how to drive better and you can look at the history of how you're doing so i i know i think there's a worry sometimes with evs that people you buy one and you just suddenly become obsessed with driving economically and trying to eke out as much range as possible and maybe that's the case but this car will certainly help you do that in terms of the the actual charging if we just have a look at that the the maximum range of this car on a full charge is about 220 miles and now clearly that will depend on a few things driving style temperature the things that you're using in the car and for me that's close but not quite close enough i really need this car to be having maybe 50 to 75 miles more than that for it to be a proposition that we would buy now this video is not going to be about charging infrastructure and so on but the vast majority of owners are going to charge at home wake up in the morning full battery charge do their daily commute their daily drive come back home plug it in again and never ever visit public charging infrastructure and for most of our journeys that would be the case however um we have a house in cornwall and we'd like to drive down there it's about 230 miles and i would like to be able to do that without having to stop and therefore this car can't quite do that which is very frustrating because as an electric vehicle when we get out on the road it ticks many many of my boxes and i'm going to say something that will definitely get the comments section going as a non-tesla ev this is number one on my shopping list so the big challenge with any non-tesla ev as you are at the mercy of a public charging infrastructure in the uk that currently from my perspective is not up to the job um i know things are improving and i know they're bound to improve over the over the coming years but at the moment it's just not good enough now you can also do some things to extend range like pre-conditioning the battery well the car's still plugged in especially in cold weather so there are some really nice screens on here um for us to see now at the moment i'm running i think it said they're 44 of battery and i've got um a predicted range now of 96 miles and i have actually done a about 100 or so miles in the car this morning i drove to the new forest and back uh to do something off camera and the other thing about this car the sat nav has some really nice features that enable you to search for the nearest charge station but it really nicely it doesn't just say where it is but it tells you what speed of charger it is um and there's also a link there where you can look for food stops and those types of things so the integration of the charge network to the sat nav seems to be much better in this new updated jaguar i-pace than in some of the other manufacturers evs have had recently this secondary touch screen here is all to do with your climate controls your gear selector are just four buttons down here drive neutral reverse and park and then you've got a range of buttons here to do with the different drive modes but we need to look at those when we get out and about driving but all in all a really nice premium place to be it's a super interior this panoramic glass roof is a must for me it just makes the car feel so airy but it has a fairly heavy tint on it as well so you're not going to get too hot if you live in a sunny climate it's lovely in here now i have as i said already been driving this quite a bit so there's plenty to talk about once we get on the road so let's get some cameras set up and go for a drive simple place to start this road test part of the review it's a lovely car to drive this the seating position and just general driving controls layout is absolutely first class i love the steering wheel it's got a nice feel to it um it's very jaguar in here but it's jaguar elevated to kind of more modern feel with all of these lovely instruments and touch screen displays the performance of the car is nippy and quick and all the instant talk and all the things you would expect from any ev really and it impresses very quickly when you get behind the wheel as i've mentioned already i think the thing that lets the car down is range but that's only because of a very specific requirement i have for many people that probably wouldn't be a massive problem but if you want to do a longer journey then i still think evs need to be looking at the 300 miles and above range and actually if i look in the comments of many of my videos people really want 400 plus miles oh hello what's that nice maserati um i i just don't think that i can see that coming anytime soon unless there's a massive increase in battery technology i think the kind of weight efficiency performance thing is that three 350 miles top end and really at the moment it's only really tesla that are that are hitting that mark a lot of the other traditional car manufacturers are struggling to get anywhere near them and i think if this car would do 300 miles man a live jack you would sell a lot of them but i just want to address this um this aim or or change of direction for jaguar that they announced very recently and that is from 2025 they're only going to do electric cars and i honestly think that's a massive massive challenge for them as a company because the i-pace at the moment is the only full ev they have what happens to x e x j f-type f-pace e-pace what happens to all of those and i'm sure they've got plans that we haven't yet seen but this is a base model as a as a kind of as a place to move on from going down that fully v root is a very very good place to start i honestly think it's one of the best evs that you can buy and if we just put to one side charging infrastructure and tesla as an ownership experience they have the charging infrastructure utterly nailed and that is why as an as a potential ev buyer model y for me is such a an interesting proposition it has the range 300 miles or so and it has the infrastructure and that's why this car for me would would be a challenge however i sit in this car and i'm going to upset the tesla rt here but this is this is on another level to any tesla i've ever sat in the build quality the the feel of quality in here is just it's just a completely different ball game and i think when you buy a tesla you almost appreciate or or or if you like um understand that the quality of the car might not be as good as you would like but the quality of the overall living with experience is far far better and that's a shame because i really want to buy one of these i-paces i really really like it [Music] now i've already mentioned earlier today i did about a hundred kind of dual carriageway miles in this car and it is super impressive you just stick on the adaptive cruise control and it munches the miles it's very smooth very quiet it's a really relaxing place to be and i get that vibe in most electric cars to be honest once they cruise on the motorway they're lovely mile munchers until you have to charge them up of course but this i think this car has something else that i need to tap into so i'm going to basically go down into this drive select program and i'm going to go into dynamic mode and that should give me a bit more throttle response and a little bit more zip and have a feeling it's going to be quite a lot of zip four-wheel drive platform plenty of go instant talk oh yes this is why i love electric cars because they're just they're pulling you get out of the corners is fantastic this car has quite a nice poise and a nice balance i guess aided by its weight although much of that weight is quite low down so the center of gravity is quite low when you get the opportunity to give your favorite b-road a bit of a blast in this car it's gonna put a big smile on your face i often bring cars down this little stretch of road because it's a lovely test of different types of corners sharper tighter slow speed ones some more open flowing corners the road surface isn't great which is always a good test of a car's stability and the view is pretty good as well turning's quite nice the noise is making well it doesn't have an augmented noise like some cars nowadays although it does make a mild noise when it's reversing i guess just to let passersby know that there's an electric car backing up but it's got poke it's it really has it doesn't have the drama and engagement of a internal combustion engine obviously but you get that instant torque you get that powerful engine that four-wheel drive oh hero come on son get up that hill but it would be rude of me not to try and take it up the petropet hill climb although for regular viewers to the channel you will notice something because this week this road has actually been closed uh because they've been doing some forestry they've been removing all of the ash trees that have had ash dieback and it looks like a moonscape now it's totally changed the petrol bed hill climb look it's so open now but it's yeah it's got load there's loads of mud on the road so i'm gonna be a little bit careful and and stuff but look it's totally changed my favorite hill it's all open now you can see everything but yeah this car on a bit of b road when you want to have a bit of a blast and a bit of a zip it's really really impressive so what are my final thoughts and final impressions on the jaguar i-pace well i knew i'd like it because i liked it the first time i drove it uh for me it has it's a very very good package um we haven't talked money yet by the way i think the car and saturn's in the kind of 65 to 68 000 quid marks something along that range so they're not cheap cars by any means but they're certainly a lot cheaper than some of the evs i've driven recently the equipment level in this hse spec is very very high it's a beautiful place to sit wonderful selection of materials i think the interior looks fantastic i love this kind of floating console here and there's a wireless charge map behind so the cockpit layout the ergonomics the design on the inside the aesthetics on the outside everything ticks my box the frustration for me is the range just isn't quite there for me and i know plenty of people it will be enough a couple hundred miles is enough for almost every journey profile but if you've got somewhere that you need to go for me it's 230 miles and i want to go there without having to stop at a charge point and that's more to do with mrs petroped's lack of patience than mine if it wasn't for that if this car did 300 miles i'd buy one tomorrow for me this is the best non-tesla ev that you can buy and that's not to do with the tesla car it's to do with our overall ownership experience so i think for jaguar going long-term going down the pure ev route from 2025 there is promise because the ev that they have is a really really good one however the things that they need to sort out they need to get more range now that's either by this has got a big battery pack in it anyway so it's got to be to do with efficiency and then they need to think about how they're going to translate their ev drivetrain into their existing lineup of cars what are they going to do with f-type what are they going to do with xe and xj and xf are they going to replace them with something else all of these things will find out i guess um but it's a bold move and i know it's what all the manufacturers are going to have to do from 2030 onwards in the uk they've banned uh you know anything other than evs and hybrids from 2030 and in a way i understand that and it's exciting times in a way i also find it incredibly sad that jaguar won't be making the f-type anymore i mean come on seriously or certainly not an f-type with a v8 engine in it anyway but if it's going to be like this little i-pace then that's good it's a good car really good car now all we need to do is get the government to sort out the charging infrastructure and let's not even go to the point of how much it costs to charge in public maybe i need to do a separate video on that because at the moment it's pretty expensive but at the moment the government are getting lots of fuel duty from petrol and diesel sales so when everybody starts to use electric where's that extra taxation going to come from hold on a minute let me think uh oh yeah electricity so there'll be a higher tax put on electric so it'll be even more expensive to charge so either way going forward motoring in this country is going to cost us more but as far as the i-pace is concerned it's a massive tick in the box for me i love it anyway massive thank you to dan and all the team at harwood's jaguar chichester um it's great when when uh when i get someone proactively reach out to me and offer me a car uh and it's been a real pleasure driving this one i hope you enjoyed it i'd love to know what you guys think of the new ipace and if you've enjoyed this video give me a thumbs up comments below always welcome if you haven't done [Music] my
79;Jaguar;2021 I-Pace;Jaguar I-PACE 2022 - The BEST electric SUV to buy?;refreshing welcome back to car chat tv guys my name is oliver and in today's episode i'm going to answer the question that someone asked me they've asked me what is the best all-electric vehicle suv money can buy right now now on our channel you may have seen we've reviewed the utron 55 the skoda enyak the mustang mark e the list goes on but today i'm going to tell you what the best is are you ready sitting right in front of me i'm going to show you come on let's have a look it's the jaguar i-pace [Music] ev400 let's go for a walk around first because the styling of this car is a little bit outlandish isn't it it doesn't really look like another jaguar that they produce and i like that it's very different unique we've got this gorgeous back we're going to come to the back in a moment but this is the got a black exterior pack on it so you've got black castle around the window trim it's around 410 pounds it looks good the only thing i'd probably do is i'll get the black wheels on there as well come to the front we've got this short stubby nose now the grill brilliant a lot of electric vehicles still have problems with the grill because you don't want an electric vehicle to look like an electric vehicle you want it to look like a normal car and they have done such a great design job here because not only does this grill look great it flows up you get this kind of conveyor belt kind of style as it curves up through the car the air blows all the way through this vent which looks great may i add up the car down the back and through this spoiler now the back we see here hasn't got a rear windscreen wiper because the air just comes down through the spoiler and pushes off all the water let's jump into the boot space because you might be thinking oh the styling of the car might make it not that practical but you'd be wrong because you've got 577 litres of boot space back here more than enough to put loads of stuff in now put them seats back 1453 litres cables are out at the moment but look they've even designed a little cubby a little tunnel here for you to put your cables we've just been lazy and not put them back but i love that not all manufacturers have a place for the cables we've seen that before so it's a great design down quick have a look at this you might be saying oh the sloping sport back design might restrict the space in the rear seats well look i'm in i'm 511 and this is the hse trim so i've got a gorgeous pano roof to look up you know what headspace is good i've got room to move knee space is great as well so not much to worry about is there now i'm going to jump into the front into the driver's seat and take this car out and tell you what it's really all about [Music] so i'm in the eye pace now and it is pouring down with rain so it's pretty good too to test what this is like in the pouring rain so i'm going to give you some statistics first now it's an ev400 so that means 400 fires are stark so 396 brake horsepower is what you get 696 newton meters of torque not to 60 in 4.5 seconds yes i know that is exciting and we will test that in a moment it's all-wheel drive you've got a 90 kilowatt battery pack with a range of miles can you get that real world probably not so you've got motors on the front and the back makes it all wheel drive now the only thing that's probably quicker than naught to 64.5 seconds you're looking at tesla's model s model three now the e-tron s actually can do 4.3 which is a couple attempts off this but it's a heavier car we have the e-tron 55 and it weighs 2 500 kilograms now this is a lighter car still over two tons at 2208 kilograms so it's a little bit more agile it's a little bit nippier but i'm going to tell you three reasons why this is the best all-electric suv okay number one we spoke about the naught 60 4.5 seconds i've put it into dynamic mode what does 4.5 seconds feel like this whoa you can feel that my head and there we have it oh my gosh and when you put it in dynamic road everything goes red so you've got four modes you've got dynamic mode and the steering's great it's really well balanced nice and stiff i can feel the car through the road i love that and then the other modes will go for him now so you've got comfort steering lightens up a bit and the acceleration on the pedal isn't as sensitive and then you've got you know the eco mode and the rain ice and snow but i love that this has got another element added to it the dynamic mode is brilliant now we have the e35 and that was really comfortable and it was a big car on the road this does not feel like an suv it's very saloon-esque the way you're sitting but that raw power that's something that i have not felt apart from in the tesla and that's why the performance that not 60 is at number one so number two has to be with the new 2022 upgrades to the i-pace you've got alexa now integrated and you can see it down here on the infotainment 10 inch infotainment there and that's fantastic yeah voice commands they've been around for a while but any proper effective ones probably not and the fact we all have alexa's at home you can be in your living room room saying oh alexa what range do i have left in my car it will tell you alexa did i lock my eye pace it will tell you and switch that round you can be in your eye pace driving home going alexa set my lounge to 22.5 degrees because that's how i like it alexa turn my living room light on because that's how i like it that integration of alexa that jaguar have done in their infotainment in their pv pro system is a touch of class and i'm a techie guy i really like it and that's why i've included it now in this jaguar eye pace it is so well balanced you've got 50 50 weight distribution from front to rear and it's so much fun when i was driving the econ 55 now i'm talking about that car as well because there's one we had recently and we did a review on we'll put it somewhere and it was a comfortable car but this has an added element the added element is it's fun the steering is incredible i do not feel i am in a big weighty suv i apply the brakes they work tremendously as well i'm going to take this around a few corners now just to show you because the body lean and roll is so minimal compared to that of other suvs in this category so the eqc mercedes you've got the bmw ix3 you've got the audi e-tron 55 and this the turning the steering of this car is it's really rather good and would i say it's as comfortable as the e-tron 55 no i wouldn't the utron 55 was brilliant with air suspension air suspension is an added option you can have in this car this is the hse specs you've got that nice pano roof and whatnot but this is better because you've got that comfort level the ride comfort isn't that bad it's minimal the etron 55 year is comfortable more but it's not going to put you off this because of the added element of fun this drives so good it's again i'll say that word like saloon-esque i'm not as high up in the car i'm still in dynamic mode i've got that performance when i was in the e25 and was put my foot down it wasn't there immediately and in dynamic mode so the accelerator is a lot more sensitive but i know i've finished work i've jumped into my own pace i want to blow a little bit of steam off what do i do dynamic jab and it goes immediately it's gone it's gone it's so good and it's multifaceted and that's why i love the i-pace and my number three has to be the looks of this car it doesn't look like other electric vehicles suvs out there and already in the rain i'm seeing dog walkers i'm seeing people and they're looking at me and they're looking at me going hey that's a good looking car and they are right it looks so different the big scoop in the vent for the air to flow visibility is great out the front the rear not so much but then you remember you have got that that flowing sport back and with other manufacturers you have to pay for that sport back this is included so all in all the look the appearance the style of this car is something really unique a little bit of vanguard and i think for those out there that want to have a premium suv all electric vehicle and want to be a little bit different then look no further than this so they're my three best things that i love about the car i'd love to know what your thoughts are and whether you agree or disagree let me know in the comments below inside the car you're looking for a luxury suv or electric vehicle the leather the materials are great this is some of the softest material i've ever touched on the dash i'm not gonna lie and it flows over there and you get different types of material on there a little intricate design which i really like now level on the door contrasting stitching brilliant this is the hse you expect good equipment we're going to throw back to adam because he's in the rear i want you to talk to me adam comfort and space go okay we're talking about comfort and space actually i think from the outside it doesn't look very big so from the outside i feel like it looks fairly small like the same sort of size as like a i don't know like a golf or something but really when you actually get in here you've actually got plenty of knee room let me show you so they're my knees plenty of room and actually you can see the doors that side there's actually quite a bit of room above for your head so i think i'd say it's quite spacious i've also got a baby seat in here as well so you get a full a full look at the back here um plenty of room for the cameras something i would say it's really comfy yeah i would say i'm pleasantly surprised awesome so it's an all-electric suv vehicle it's got regenerative braking but what i love is you can just put it on high harvest as much energy back into that battery and then when you turn off the car it will stay in that high mode where other electric vehicles they forget and you have to re-configure it where every time you get in the buttons and the satisfaction you get on some of these rotary dials are so good and it's a pull and a push so if you push in you've got your electric seats and your cool seats you pull it out you can do your climate control and blower and whatnot but they're really good i do like a rotary uh wheel here so we need to talk a little bit about range jaguars say that 292 miles is what this will get in real world terms i'm not so sure that's the case especially in the uk in cold february that's chilly now charging this will take maximum 100 kilowatt charger good luck finding them they are rare but if you do every 15 minutes you will add about 18 miles to your battery now in the updated 2022 a really cool thing is on board charge is now 11 kilowatts it used to be 7 kilowatts so when you charge it at home in your wall box overnight it used to be 12.6 hours till full but now it's 8.6 so you're saving yourself four hours well done jaguar good upgrade so say you're only finding a 50 kilowatt then all you need to look at then is every 15 minutes it's around 40 miles added so all in all if you're out and about and you need to charge fully it's still gonna take just under an hour to get this baby back to full charge they have updated it war box is where it's at 11 kilowatts get home park up jab it in 8.6 hours jobs done so in summary the jaguar eye pace is such a great all-rounder and then some because of that performance 4.5 seconds not to 60. and the accelerator in dynamic mode is so responsive i love that feeling i just i need to get ahead of this yeah and it helps me out i needed to get ahead someone's parked there and we've looked at three cool reasons why we talked a little bit about the updates we've talked about the charging as well now you can pick a new 2022 up for around 65 620 pounds so i want to know your thoughts what do you think have you agreed with me disagreed let me know everything that's going on through your mind right now in the comments below also with jaguar's pvpro system the cameras are great quality it's really hard to beat really if you look here we've got the camera set up and now it is raining remember but if i click any one of these we get the simulations we can see different elements of the car and it's not showing it in its greatest light but the quality is there it is raining and it's just a great feature to point out as well we just want to say a huge thank you to jaguar landrover northampton who have been really accommodating and super helpful so check them out so that has been our episode on the ipace we've even tested it in the rain for you look at today let's do a summary what have we done i've told you my reasons why this is the best all-electric suv you can buy right now i'm sure you've got something to say about it i've showed you the practical side as well that performance not to 64.5 seconds it's so much fun let me know all your thoughts about the car in the comments below throw me a like get subbed and i'll see you on the next one [Music] you
80;Jaguar;2021 I-Pace;Ultimate Jaguar I-Pace Review | Whats new with the Facelift? | 4K;[Music] hi i'm richard from drive green and today we're going to be taking a look at the new jaguar i-pace the i-pace has always been a very impressive ev and today we're going to be looking at what's new and improved with this latest model and hopefully at the same time helping you decide whether it might be the right ev for you [Music] the i-pace was originally launched back in 2018 into a marketplace that was very much dominated by tesla at the premium end and it was hugely successful it won european car of the year and it went on to be the fourth best-selling ev in the uk in 2019 an incredible achievement for such a premium priced car although the i-pace was the first premium electric suv and although it's a very tough act to follow it now lives in a much more competitive ev marketplace you now have the audi e-tron the mercedes eqc and now the bmw ix3 as a general rule i don't like drawing direct car to car comparisons every car has its different advantages and disadvantages and like to bring those out and let you decide what's important to you however i must admit compared to its competition the i-pace generally has set the bar really really high looks wise the i-pace is undoubtedly a good-looking car very stylish and with a real presence it doesn't have that typical blocky suv look it manages to look sleek and sporty at the same time as being quite a high riding car it looks nice from pretty much every angle and there's some lovely details on the car for example you've got this sweeping air intake under the bonnet here which adds to the car's aerodynamics you've got this nice grill that you can have in black or with chrome detailing like this one here and of course you've got the lovely jaguar badge in sporty red the original i-pace just like the new one is an incredibly handsome car its crossover suv styling and sizing meant it was also very practical with plenty of passenger space and a really generous boot i don't actually think anything's really been changed with the cars exterior and honestly i haven't actually noticed any notable differences at all which is okay as the original i-pace was and still is a really good-looking car and it doesn't yet need an update or there isn't a great deal of room for improvement in my opinion it's the same story when it comes to the interior of the car which again hasn't really changed and it's still as well made and luxurious as the original car this car has a really nice premium luxury feel about it very nicely designed inside the materials are really good it's very well put together it does make you feel very special makes you feel successful like you want in a premium luxury car genuinely is a very nice place to be in the new eye pace we're driving today we've got the performance seats as opposed to the sport seats that were in the the earlier car we were driving before both are very very nice uh certainly built to a very premium standard they're very comfy they're very very stylish and particularly when you're looking at the higher spec models they're incredibly adjustable they also when you're looking at the sc models and the hse models you get a memory seat function and that's both on the passenger and driver side you're able to store three different seat settings which is a really nice touch [Music] on the top spec hse model as well you've got called seats also which is a nice touch of luxury however i always find that a little bit strange the idea of cooling once bottom down there's loads of space in the front and the back luxury travel for all your passengers especially when the center cup holder section is pulled down this also doubles up as a pull through hatch when you're carrying a long item in the car the boot is plenty big enough to mean the i-pace ticks the all-important practical family and holiday car roll as well there is also a small storage space under the boot floor and a small front offering some useful extra storage for charging cables for example i really was honestly amazed at how well this car actually handles especially given its size and its weight and its high riding suv design especially its dynamic sports mode it handles brilliantly [Music] there's plenty of power there ferocious acceleration in fact i have to say probably it ranks within my top few evs in terms of its actual handling it really does corner like a sports car [Music] it's ground-up ev design and even weight distribution dual motor wheel drive format and the 296 kilowatt motor delivers a brilliant handling 400 horsepower car with a super fast four and a half second naught to 60 time the i-pace's truly amazing and engaging drive really does set it apart from other evs especially in the suv sector as it really is brilliant and i think it's very very hard to beat indeed one thing i do like with this new i-pace is they've given it a really nice sound which i know sounds strange because obviously we're used to evs being quiet as they should be and don't get me wrong this is still a quiet well insulated car and certainly with the stereo one you can't hear any noise at all however if you like driving a sporty style and really putting your foot down with lots of acceleration the car makes this wonderful noise i'm not sure how well it's going to come out on the car's audio but it's a lovely deep rumble it doesn't sound like a car engine nor should it however is a really really nice sound and i think it adds to the driver engagement you know you really kind of connect a little bit more to what's going on under the bonnet and i think that adds to the the fun of the car and the enjoyability when you're driving well in a performance style another nice driving feature is the car's slippery surface mode i mean it's not quite a 4x4 however you have got a dual motor all-wheel drive setup and if you've got air suspension on your car and you increase the ride height you've got you know quite a capable sort of multi-terrain sort of vehicle and also it adds a lot to safety when you're driving in particular in wet slippery icy conditions range-wise jaguars still have the i-paces doing about 280 miles worth of driving range and whilst that is probably completely possible in the right conditions and with a perhaps a sedate driving style i think it's worth remembering this is a big heavy car with lots of power so i think in most cases you should perhaps reign in your range expectation a little bit more personally i would have it around about 220 to maybe 250 miles depending on your preferred driving style it's not the most efficient of cars and i would like moving force perhaps to see jaguar squeeze a little bit more range out of their 90 kilowatt hour battery however all this performance and the fact is a real driver's car is inevitably going to come at the expense of range 250 miles however is still plenty of range for most people and the car is also capable of 100 kilowatt charging at the right rapid charger so it is possible to more or less fully recharge the car in about an hour most rapid charging is however still done at 50 kilowatts uh as a result i think with a 30 minute charging stop somewhere like the motorway services you're going to be looking at delivering about an extra 70 miles of driving range back into the car but obviously you start with a great driving range 250 miles say to start off with so with a little charging stop every now and then you still have a very capable and decent long-range ev the new i-pace is also capable of three-phase 11 kilowatt charging if you're lucky enough to have a three-phase fast charger either at home or at work in all honesty this isn't going to matter to the vast majority of people as not many people are going to have a three-phase charger at home as a result of which despite the upgraded charger you're still going to be charging at seven kilowatts like most tvs however that's going to give you roughly 20 miles worth of extra range for an hour's worth of charging time at home again this isn't really relevant because they're rarely charging from empty to full when those charging's done overnight just like with the original i-pace in the latest model you've still got three basic trim levels uh at the lower end you've got the s and then you've got the sc and then the top spec hse on top of these trims there's also a multitude of different spec items you can add to your car the lower spec s trim is still a very very nice car although it does like a few of the premium touches the mid-spec sc on top of the standard spec adds quite a few extra bits memory seats 20 inch alloys power tailgate premium led lights and nicer seats the top spec hse model like the bright blue original version we were driving earlier contains a number of other options as well you've got matrix led lights cooled seats with even more adjustment settings a meridian 3d surround sound stereo an adaptive cruise control with steering assist with the new i-pace you've now got an extra trim level available which is the black edition it's available fundamentally in an sc and hse spec however as standard it comes with a pan roof and adaptive cruise control however with the black spec it's mainly about the look of the car it has a much more aggressive appeal you've got black alloys a black grille and a slightly bigger tailgate spoiler there's a whole host of additional options you can add to your ips and these include a multitude of different 20 inch alloys there's even a couple of 22 inch ones which are massive you've got the different seats you've got a variety of different color interiors and headliners multiple different finishes on the dash this secondary touchscreen here that you use to control the heating system that's an extra item of spec that you can add to the the lower spec s model over a standard on the hse and the se models you've got the beautiful pan roof of course you've got a 360 degree 3d camera system self parking function you've got a driver assist package which includes a steering assist as well you've got a head up display you've got this clear view rear view mirror system you've also got the air suspension which is an hour smart air suspension system which will automatically adjust the ride height when you're going at high speed the upgrade to the air suspension the 3d element to the 360 degree camera system and this rear view clearview mirror are all new items of spec that are available on the new i-pace the infotainment system has also had a bit of an upgrade and whilst uh graphically it looks a little bit more stylish fundamentally it's just the same as the original version and to be honest it still isn't a very nice system to use the icons are small and it's poorly structured with multiple submenus and it's just really quite hard to get along with that being said whilst it might take a little while to get used to it if this was your car you would spend the time on it to crack its secrets personally i think the infotainment system is the weakest part of this car in fact you could you could say it's the only weak part of the car however it's not a deal breaker because the car more than makes up for it with everything else and if like a lot of people you use android auto or apple carplay both which are stand up within this system then the fact that the jaguar interface isn't very good it's going to be largely irrelevant despite all its brilliance and its high equipment levels especially in the the higher spec models i feel the original i-pace is lacking a few things it doesn't have auto hold and it doesn't have stop start functionality in its adaptive cruise control both of which are things that i would expect to see in a premium price tv at this level also there's a bit of a lack of adjustability in its regen breaking you've only got two settings and the highest setting for me isn't quite fierce enough so i would like to see some more settings i'd certainly like to see a higher regen level so you can enjoy a more one pedal driving style and i'd also like the regen braking to be more easily accessible because on the original i-pace you can only adjust it when the car is in park well the good news is jaguar have improved these few things um the car now has auto hold which is great that's something i really really did want to see on a car of this price point of this level the adaptive cruise control has also been improved with the stop start technology we're after i also fancy the regen level the car has been increased slightly to give it a more of a more of a one pedal driving experience which you want the regen adjustment is still done through the touch screen and there is only a couple of settings however in all honesty it's not too hard to change and in reality to be fair you'll probably set it to high and you'll just leave it like that for most of the time perhaps only changing it to low when you're cruising at speed on somewhere like a motorway so the already brilliant i-pace has had multiple improvements with this newer latest model whether you're looking at a used original i-pace or whether you're looking at buying a brand new i-pace like this one here you will not be disappointed the i-pace is a brilliant car it's very good looking it's very practically sized it's well spec the interior is lovely and it's incredibly well made premium car it really is a very special car and it's got the performance handling to match when you look at the premium electric suv market i think the i-pace has set the bar very high indeed in fact it's going to be a very very hard electric car to be i hope this video has been useful and help you get a bit more of a feel to the jaguar eye pace as well as what's new about its latest model if you'd like to find out more if you'd like to arrange a test drive please do get in touch please also

81;Jaguar;2022 I-Pace;NEW Jaguar I-Pace 2022 in-depth EV review  do these updates make it better than ever? | What Car?;[Music] things move quickly in the electric car world in 2018 when jaguar launched the i-pace it beat bmw audi and mercedes in bringing a premium electric suv to the market and even without much direct competition at the time it proved to be a fantastic electric car but it didn't take long for its rivals to catch up in barely three years since then the ev landscape is totally different with the i-pace's only real rivals at launch had tesla badges now it's up against the audi e-tron mercedes eqc bmw ix3 and volvo xc40 recharge with many more to come the british brand has also announced its plans to become electric only from 2025 which is big news and should we be excited for its future or has this once trailblazing premium electric suv been overtaken and left behind by its new rivals just a few years into its life well it's just had some updates and we're driving the new i-pace and in this video we're going to tell you all the changes and we'll tell you everything else you need to know about the car before we get stuck into that save thousands of pounds off your next new car on whatcol.com and do subscribe to our channel if you want to see all of our other new car reviews let's first talk about what's new with these model year updates starting with a few new paint choices like this portofino blue the 18-inch alloys that were standard on s-trim have been replaced with bigger 19-inch alloys but we've got the optional 20-inch alloys here there's also now a chrome style finish to the grille plus you can add an optional bright pack which we've got on this car and gives you this chrome surround as well as a few other flashy bits of trim on the door mirrors the rear diffuser and the window surrounds but hang on why does it have a grill because if it's an electric car then it doesn't have an engine that needs cooling well i'm glad you asked because this apparently does serve a functional purpose to a certain extent the grill you can see is filled in but down here this allows air to pass through and help keep the batteries cool while this directs the air through the bonnet vent accelerating the airflow over the wipers onto the base of the windscreen thus reducing aerodynamic drag apparently i know this isn't new but while we're talking aero at the rear of the car apparently the airflow is powerful enough to be one of the reasons that you don't have a rear windscreen wiper there's also a special hydrophobic coating on the glass as well so the air comes through so powerfully up here and through the back that it just blows the water off the rear windscreen which is great when you're on the motorway but not quite so useful when you're just reversing in the rain anyway back to the new stuff and the i-pace now has a three-phase 11 kilowatt on-board charger previously it only had a single phase seven kilowatt on-board charger now that means if you have an 11 kilowatt home wall box you can now charge at 11 kilowatts and get a naught to 100 charge in around nine hours previously if you had an 11 kilowatt home war box charger you could only charge at seven kilowatts which would get you the same amount of charge in almost 13 hours and you can of course still fast charge your ipace and we'll talk more about that later the interior changes bring some extra equipment the 360 degree 3d camera now comes as standard plus the clearsight digital rearview mirror which we first saw in the range rover evoke is now available as an option both front seats are heated as standard and there's wireless phone charging across the lineup too the optional meridian sound system now has an extra two speakers up here there's also a cabin air ionization system as well the system can be used with the i-pace's pre-conditioning system to clear the cabin of allergens but perhaps the biggest news inside is this updated infotainment system so now it has jaguar land rover's pv pro system which before this you could only find on the land rover defender it's got the same physical layout and setup as before so up here you've got a 10 inch screen with a 5 inch screen lower down here but if you go for a jaguar i-pace s the entry-level trim then this lower screen is an optional extra and without it you get a kind of touch sensitive button layout instead so now the infotainment system has a revamped menu layout and the navigation system has been updated as well but you get apple carplay and android auto as standard so surely you're just better off using google maps or waze anyway as you would be in any other car and the system itself isn't the best out there so the problems with it are that it can still be a little bit laggy when you're jumping between the different functions and also there's quite a lot of menus and sub menus and it's quite baffling to try and get your head around it all plus these icons are still quite small they were on the previous model and now they've kind of moved them around a little bit but they're still quite small which means if you're driving it's just difficult to hit them accurately and so when you compare it to the bmw ix3 and the mercedes eqc they both have better systems partly because they offer some level of physical control to use the infotainment system with a rotary dial in the bmw ix3's case you do still have physical dials in the eye pace for the climate controls and these actually work quite well so you push them in to control the seat heating and you pull them out again to control the fan speed and the temperature and actually even though there is some element of touch screen complicatedness in the middle this actually works pretty well just like before you also still get a 12.3 inch digital driver display which is good nice and bright and clear you can also choose what you're looking at by using these controls on the steering wheel and also they look like they might be touch sensitive controls but they're actual buttons that you need to press which is good because if they were touch sensitive you can sometimes be accidentally turning things on that you don't mean to be like we have seen in the new vw id3 for example but no such problems here and generally this is a very impressive interior we said when the i-pace was first launched that it was jaguar's best interior and a few years on that does still remain the case the materials are very good and the fit and finish generally is impressive but you can see there's a bit of wobbles here and there so it's not quite consistent throughout the entire interior which is why ultimately the audi e-tron is a bit better for fit and finish because it is put together a little better but it is extremely boring by comparison the i-pace does feel really special inside and it's quite practical too so you've got a lot of storage trays like this wireless phone charging up here somewhere to put the key or a pen there a couple of cup holders and this massive central bin here you can even take these cup holders out so all things considered not much has changed really but it is still a very good interior up front there's enough room for a couple of six footers to properly lounge out and feel pretty comfortable in the back of the eye pace here you can see i'm just under six foot legroom is good headroom no problem really decent amount available there and it's more spacious back here than in the back of the ix3 or the mercedes eqc but you have got a bit of a sloping and curving roofline and these windows are quite small so an audi e-tron does feel a bit more spacious and open back here plus these rear seats don't really do anything particularly clever in an ix-3 you can recline the outer rear seats but in the eye pace you do have some trays under the seats in the back here but they're a bit awkward to get to because you can't pull them out and they've got this nasty feeling plastic on the entry point you have a couple of isofix mounts on the outer rear seats plus you can pull this down for an arm rest and a couple of cup holders you can even fold this entire seat down completely to give yourself very easy access to the boot or to put your skis through but there isn't a seven seat option in the i-pace it is 5c only which means the tesla model x remains for now the only 7-seat electric suv the i-pace's boot isn't the biggest around but you still wouldn't describe it as small we managed to fit seven carry-on sized suitcases into the boot below the parcel shelf here which by comparison the audi e-tron and also the ix-3 managed to fit eight suitcases and the model s got a ridiculous 11 into its boot but still here you can see simple shape easy proportions and a decent amount of underfloor storage for the charging cables but not much else it's also handy you might think having an extra boot in the front where the engine would have been or not i can just about fit my phone in the front here but not much else anyway let's go for a drive so the first thing to point out is that these updates haven't really had any impact on how the i-pace drives so it's still got a 90 kilowatt-hour battery pack it's got two electric motors one on the front axle one on the rear axle making it all-wheel drive and it has 395 brake horsepower which is a lot and it has a naught to 60 miles per hour time of just 4.5 seconds which is properly rapid admittedly not quite as quick as what the tesla model s offers but still compared to pretty much everything else on the road that is very quick indeed but with the i-pace it's not just about straight line acceleration because it also handles pretty well too the batteries are beneath the floor so it's got a nice low centre of gravity it also has acclaimed 50 50 weight distribution as well front to rear and when you're on a twisty road behind the wheel with this nice precise well-weighted steering it is good to drive it definitely doesn't feel like a high-riding suv part of that sensation comes from the slightly more saloon-like driving position you get with the i-pace sitting you a bit closer to the ground than the e-tron and the eqc this can tackle a corner way better than those cars as well in the e-tron and in the eqc there's a lot more body lane but while the i-pace is good to drive there is now one other electric suv that is actually better the i-pace has swatted away competition from the e-tron and the eqc in the handling stakes but the bmw ix3 does have it beaten it's even more agile and enjoyable to drive and with the i-pace there does come a point where you feel it has too much power for what it's able to handle and the stability control can be very abrupt in its interventions now admittedly you do need to be going very quickly for that to be noticeable but even in normal driving the ix3 it's got slightly nicer steering it's got better body control it's a really really good suv but so too is the eye pace and if out and out performance is your thing then this is comfortably quicker than the ix3 it's also all-wheel drive whereas the bmw is rear-wheel drive only now we're not claiming that the i-pace is some defender-esque off-road king but it has got some modern snow settings it's also got hill ascent and descent controls and if you tick the optional air suspension then you can adjust its ride height too which is handy for the treacherous surrey terrain this will no doubt be tasked with braving which brings us on to the ride now on the 18-inch alloys you could get before with the standard passive suspension the i-pace was a really comfortable thing now that you can only get 19-inch alloys as the smallest wheels we suspect it's probably going to be a little bit firmer but should still be a pretty comfortable electric car we've got 20-inch alloys on this test car with adaptive suspension both of which will cost extra but if you fork out for it you do still get a very comfortable electric car it absorbs initial impacts really well off the road much better than something like an eqc but when you have got this in comfort mode with this adapter suspension and there is quite a bit of movement in the car but it doesn't become uncomfortable and you can also tighten it up by putting it in dynamic mode although if you do that you get quite a few more audible thumps through the suspension but it's still nothing like you'd experience in the eqc and generally this is a comfortable car that seems very well suited to british tarmac an e-tron is ultimately more comfortable and quieter and actually that is the benchmark of ev comfort the ix-3 even without sophisticated air suspension is also really well controlled and comfortable we've spoken about how quick the eyepiece is but what about slowing down well you have regenerative braking like you do in every other electric car so when you lift off the accelerator the car will slow itself down there are two different settings for it high and low but the annoying thing is to switch between them you've got to dive into the infotainment system find various different menus and submenus and then finally get to it so it's annoying it's as complicated as that but the good thing is that when you decide what setting you want to use the car will stay in that setting even if you turn it off leave come back to the car so when you start it again it will remain in whatever it was in before which is quite useful because probably you're just going to get in this stick it on high and then forget about it but it's annoying that the same doesn't happen for the drive mode so if you stick it in eco while you're driving then you stop get out come back it will go back to its default comfort setting it won't stay in eco which can be a little bit irritating another annoying thing the view out the back yes you've got a nice swooping roofline but it does result in quite a letterbox view out the back of the car which i guess is another reason to consider going for this optional rear view mirror camera but overall driving the ipays is a pleasant comfortable enjoyable experience even now these updates haven't changed anything really and it's got a lot more electric car rivals that it's up against it still stacks up very well indeed but what else do you need to know about the jaguar i-pace it's priced from 65 000 to 75 000 pounds which isn't cheap but it is very similar to the pricing of the audi e-tron and the mercedes eqc although the bmw ix3 is a little bit cheaper also the i-pace has been around for a little longer than those rivals so there are a few more choices to be had on the used market the i-pace also starts to look pretty good value when you consider its official range which is 292 miles now admittedly that's further than the e-tron the ix-3 and the eqc but with all of those cars it's difficult to achieve that claimed official range but in our official independent testing we recorded a result of 253 miles from a full charge in the i-pace which is very good indeed however just bear in mind if you aren't fussed about a premium badge there are a growing number of more mainstream electric suvs that offer similarly impressive ranges for a lot less money when it comes to charging the i-pace up we've already talked about the new 11 kilowatt on-board charger but just like before the maximum charging speed accepted by the car is 100 kilowatts and that's great and means from a rapid charger you can get a naught to eighty percent charge in about 40 minutes the problem is 100 kilowatt charges are still quite rare in the uk more common are 50 kilowatt charges where you'll get a naught to 80 charge in about 85 minutes but all of those evs are at the mercy of third-party charging networks which are improving but still complicated to use and poorly maintained all teslas have a huge advantage here by having access to the american brand's absolutely fantastic supercharger network the i-pace is really well equipped even entry-level s-trim comes with loads of kit but if you do go for that then it might be worth considering the drive assist pack on the options list because it adds adapter cruise control and steering assist jaguar doesn't have the best record when it comes to reliability but the i-pace is covered by a three-year unlimited mileage warranty which is pretty standard for electric cars also common with every other electric car the battery is covered by a separate warranty in the i-pace that is eight years or a hundred thousand miles [Music] the jaguar i-pace was a fantastic electric car when it launched and the truth is even now with a new crop of very impressive competitors it still stacks up very well indeed it's got a fantastic range it's a nice thing to drive and it's plush inside we can understand if you go for an ix-3 instead being even better to drive and cheaper but the i-pace is still a very recommendable electric suv if jaguar's bold electric future has this as a starting point there are plenty of reasons to be excited for its next products save thousands of pounds

82;Jaguar;2022 I-Pace;2022 Jaguar I-Pace Quick Review // The Sleeper Weve All Been Sleeping On;welcome to extra throttle house i'm thomas and i'm james and this is the extra channel yep that's what you told me to stop there i know because they always they know what that is now do they yeah yeah what if they don't what if they're new it's a more casual one we have another channel it's the main channel this is the extra one and today we're featuring so we've been filming some really cool stuff on our california trip yeah but this has been keeping us going noble steed yeah and this is the 2022 jaguar i-pace which means it's the electric one because there is an e-pace which sounds like it would be electric that makes noise but it's not it's just a smaller f-pace right so that's petrol but this is dual motor lithium all-wheel drive it's not a lead acid battery we know that it is it's all-wheel drive wheel drive range the range is 253 miles so it's not world breaking let's see if i can stump him is it bigger or smaller than a uh than an ev6 i don't know about the actual length but the wheelbase is bigger and it's just underneath the uh ionic 5. this photograph's big it looks like a big thing yeah when you see a picture of this it looks bigger than the ionic five would be but it's not but the ionic five is bigger it's actually kind of low too this has got some ev6 looking side yeah yeah yeah it does yeah it looks like it is absolutely prioritized passenger space like this is a big old honking door look at the length of that but the ev6 is bigger it feels bigger at least standing next to it but i mean you expect this since it's a jag and not a kia to be nicer right yeah it's more money it is this so this is 70 grand 70 grand u.s we'll get the canadian price okay um but they've they've knocked off the price like it's this is the hsc it only comes in hse now which is the jlr fancy trim and it is 11 000 cheaper than it was so it's the same price as the base was and it's currently at 30 battery and it says 78 miles who's got range anxiety we don't we do oh we don't no no um but yeah it is a jaguar it does cost more it doesn't provide any more range than the others it looks cool though it it looks pretty cool i think it looks pretty cool this isn't a funny color it's kind of champagne and i will never support champagne but this one they've called it aruba aruba aruba jamaica um okay fine i'll beat you i mean this you want to go through this every single time it's up to you it's like it's you know it's a trial trial all right that's fine you ready we're going on three uh yeah we'll throw on three ready okay one two three one two three one two three what is this is a karate chop that is not it's not in the passenger seat broke my streak okay driving james i told you to wear the same clothes now they're gonna know it's a different day it's not a different day that's the difference that's yourself do a bunch of wardrobe changes yeah we're now in a totally different canyon following a group of porsche enthusiasts 911 enthusiasts specifically yes oh there's a couple there's a caveman in there there came in there caiman that was dressed as a gt4 and he's actually a gts right or it's a gt4 and he's down bash and then there was a gt the turbo dressed as a gt2 anyway electric cars so that stuff we were talking about the price yeah this is we found out the canadian price by the way it starts at 99 900 or something says 100 000 canadian for this yes which is a significant amount of money because it out prices the model y long range it out prices the new bmw ix yep it's but like it's very nice in here yeah very nice and if you listen closely it makes the weird thrum of a flat six you know what it can do it can stay with nine elevens on a canyon run yeah yeah we literally are look at that anyway we'll get to that in a second gravel gravel and gravity i think is going to be the issue what is flying around oh the charging cable the charging cable so we've we've actually had charging adventures with this car since you last saw us okay um so we managed to charge this they've they've increa they've improved the on-board charger for this so beforehand if you've got an eye pace it would have been 12 and a half hours at home to charge which is we've talking about this that's actually too long that means if you go to bed and wake up in the morning you're not fully charged now it's eight and a half hours so you can go to bed and wake up like i need to get on your level of caffeine right now i'm just i'm a morning guy you know okay i can't turn the way the 911's turn i can feel the weight this way he's 48 fill the gap in with this yeah there's plenty of torque we've got 512 pound feet of torque so this does four and a half seconds to 60. and i have hustled this thing around canyons and honestly it is severely impressive yeah there's no feel to the steering whatsoever no there absolutely is feel no it is not were you in the right mode i tried every mode i tried all the modes and there's this is absolutely waiting up in the corner okay it's waiting up there's no feel to it okay so it's like a maserati mc20 whoa back up back up back up yeah okay it feels that it feels confident this drives even though it's the bigger looking thing we mentioned about the ionic five yeah this drives the way i wanted the ionic five to drive pretty much it drives the way the ionic five looks and the ev6 look but those drive a little bit more soft and not sharp and this is twice the price with less range less ability to charge at speed because it this thing here's the squeal from the tires it's a cyclist but it's it's such an impressive car to drive the drive i did not expect i know it's a jag so i should have been a bit more like you know should have given it some credit but yeah yeah i mean you look at it and you assume it's just going to be kind of another those are your sunglasses yeah um um i assume it's gonna be just kind of another kind of crossover thing right but they did obviously spend some time tuning the damping can you switch me into a more aggressive driving mode i think i'm doing this whole thing in eco right now you are yeah that's raining right nice quickly yeah i need to be in sports dynamic oh yeah oh the gauges go red see now if we're in trouble for going fast all the porsches are in trouble first so we're just like yeah we're gonna go tell them off that's what we're doing i love that i can just stamp on it here just catch up we'll just we'll just play if we get pulled over we'll just play the card of i just thought this is we're just with traffic i don't know yeah we're forcing it right now oh my god this this guy's having the worst canyon run because he's got to feel like he's like i'm just i'm i'm pushing it here and this like suv is this wasn't planned by the way we just turned on the canyon and we're like screw it we'll do it yeah so it doesn't charge as fast as some of the cheaper options it doesn't have as much range but the range is actually fine the problem is i find is that it does it's just very expensive now and it's also not super consistent with how much range it tells you it has left no no but we had an okay charging experience in fact let's talk about that in a minute because we don't talk about the charging experience now the okay charging experience i i mean it was okay yeah you were just really tired but the caveat here is if you have an ev you probably have a charger at home which we don't have so we have to face the extra logistics of not having that and last night we drove home from willow springs to la which is about two hour drive yeah and we didn't have enough range to start with so the car didn't let us down in terms of expectation but it means we had to stop at an electrify america charger yes which didn't work the first one didn't work and not only that even if you could justify the charge times to yourself like this takes this said an hour and three minutes to fall to fall yeah uh and i think it's like 40 minutes to 80 the thing that we didn't account for was a queue for the charges there's only three of them and they were all being used so that's another extra block of time so i can't believe how well this car drives by the way yeah i know i can i'm feeling it these 911's gotta feel terrible i bought this for a reason oh it hustles yeah it really really does we were using this to to chase down uh ferraris and mc20s is a camera car in the canyons and it did it no problem i bet the mustang marquee could probably do this just as well the mustang market could credit to the marquee it's got great driving dynamics and it is also about half the price a little bit more so that's i think that's the biggest issue here is that this now even if they even with the changes they've made and they've upgraded this infotainment you've gone without you yeah so this is i don't think i've ever been in a jlr car where the infotainment has worked no except for this one this is the first time this screen has not malfunctioned and it has been totally fine and usable and it's reasonably fast and it's just the rest of it's more even more usable than than a tesla or whatever right because we've got a lot of hard buttons versus the stuff that matters right the climate control is a bit weird with these knobs and stuff but i you know i got used to it i'm fine and like i'm assuming these are like some sort of like vegan leather or something i don't even know i didn't look it up but they're really the leather is really nice everything feels very very comfortable and the seats are great also it's so quiet on the highway very quiet so quiet right not like a lack of engine noise just the insulation from the road yeah on a concrete highway that's where it would embarrass the ionic fives and the ev6 i think so i said to thomas i was like you know how much would you pay if everything else was the same as ionic five how much would you pay for the level of quietness this brings and we both kind of agreed on like the 10 grand 10 grand yeah like like 10 grand would give if it gave me it doesn't though it's way more yeah it's as like aspect it's because it's the hst over a top trim ionic 5 ev6 it's 40 grand canadian more so whatever that is 25 us more but it is a jag and there is a badge associated with it and its driving dynamics wipe the floor with those cars and the range isn't far off so i totally get this guy i think this car has been slept on and i'm part of the problem it is i've always just been like oh it's the ipace that's one of those early ev ones yeah this is one of the early that's exactly what it is it's an earl's one of those early ones that they did it as like an experiment or to lower their their fleet average fuel economy or whatever it was right but this is now a good ev no question if you bought this and you spent more money over an ionic five i would go good job good work yeah good choice like like 100 it's it's not it's not a question whether or not um it's good enough for the price it's a question of whether or not you want to pay the price and i thought we'd be snubbed at the charger i thought the guys in the id4 and the kona electric would be like oh this one oh we've got the eye pace oh yeah and then everyone was so i was so ready to be like yeah yeah i know everyone was so nice yeah and they were like hey i'm just gonna be done in a minute um because we can work out the etiquette if someone's at 92 percent and we and we're we're like waiting in queues yeah because you can see you can see how much charge they've got if someone's at 90 and we're sitting there like ah like are they expected to be like you know what that is enough for me right now yeah or do you let them get to 100 because if we were about to knock on the window but excuse me have you had enough yeah but he told us he'd almost finished he ended up being a very nice gentleman so i'm glad that we didn't say anything oh my god so it can do a 911 can you run yeah it's ranger's okay the interior is wonderful yeah the materials are lovely as you said it looks pretty cool right it looks pretty cool it's just it's a bit expensive but you know what it could generate some g-forces yeah but for the panache of the brand the nash that's the word it sounds like something from british bake off yeah oh that's a chocolate panache is that ganache it's a ganache no that's a i don't know it's very early in the morning so we've lost some of our vocabulary but the brand associated with it which is quite fancy oh it's a thin bit of road i'm just gonna take it big yeah it's quite a fancy brand yep it's quite a fancy car i think it's worth the money i mean if you're looking for an ev that's different and cool and nice it drives well i mean it's good it's maybe like some people might consider it a little bit overpriced but i don't think it is i think the people buying it aren't going to care probably not no because i think from from the driver's seat i have no problems with this car it's been lovely and it's just embarrassing 911s so well i've slowed down now just because and you're still keeping up well i can just plant my foot and make up the gap it does make some sounds oh there it goes you're really on it that's actually i think that's one of the first times i've heard that yeah i mean it's great yeah it's great i can't probably can't embarrass a thai cat but normal 911's full of dads full of dads for sure you
83;Jaguar;2022 I-Pace;2022 Jaguar I-Pace review (inc. 0-100);g'day i'm paul so jaguar was one of the first premium brands to have a ev to market and jaguar took it one step further by developing a bespoke ev platform while a lot of manufacturers just took an internal combustion car through some ev components in and said hey here it is and it's either efficient or effective so jaguar being the first to market does that mean they are the most successful well not really they haven't really sold a great deal of these so today i just want to take it for a spin and figure out what's going on what's wrong with this why are people not buying it so the ipace kicks off in australia from a little over 140 000 today we're reviewing the sc specification which is the entry level this competes with things like the bmw ix the mercedes-benz eqc and the audi e-tron so there are a few competitors now in this segment today we're going to do a detailed review of this car so if you do want to skip ahead to other parts of the review you can use those time codes on the screen or if you're on youtube scroll down and use the chapters below and if you haven't done so already subscribe to our channel press the bell icon that's going to tell you every single time i swap my face [Music] let's talk about the exterior so you've got 12 external colors to pick from they're all free of charge except two that are like a 3 900 option now what about the design so one of the key differences here with the ipace is that they've made it look quite different to the regular car and i think maybe that's one of the reasons it hasn't been as successful if you look at things like the eqc and you know the e-tron as well they just look like other versions of a mercedes-benz or an audi whereas this looks completely different look styling is subjective but i actually think this looks pretty good it turns a lot of heads out on the road and it really is just such a different car to see out there and i love down the bottom here it looks like the grill just ends here but it actually continues all the way through to this opening up the top here and that goes over the top of the car and pushes down on the rear window which means they don't need to have a wiper so that saves weight and also uses less electricity so pretty clever innovation there now behind this grille there you do have some engine or some motor components rather you can access those behind the bonnet here and there's some cooling down the bottom there as well got a camera down here for the 360 camera this car is optioned with the black pack so kind of just blacks out all the elements on and i think it looks fantastic especially here with the black body color as well over here you have a set of full led headlights these aren't matrix led though you've got to pay extra for that which i reckon is a little bit disappointing matrix led lights really should be standard on you know most cars today especially premium brands a little air vent out here that kicks out to the side here around the side we have a set of 20 inch alloy wheels i do like this design as well so continuing on with that black theme it's got a matte black finish to it so it really gives this bit of a mean look out on the road it kind of just hides all of the design elements and i think it looks really nice there i find it interesting as well here that if you have a look at the brakes so typically in an eva you don't really use brakes all that much for the mechanical brakes it uses region and that means you do get a whole lot more brake life out of your vehicle some of the ev manufacturers like the bmw with the ix have gone with big flashy brakes but you can see here with jag they've just kept it fairly minimal there with a smaller rotor and just a standard sort of caliper on the car you've got your specification down the side here s e and then jaguar lettering up on the top here you've got an indicator built into that wing mirror with another camera there for the 360 camera in terms of the door handles when you lock the car these disappear into the car and then when you unlock it they pop out like that so it actually sort of sits flush with the car while you're driving so again reducing the amount of drag meaning you're able to get by without using as much electricity this car has optional privacy glass and then come around to the back so you can see up the top here this is what i was talking about you get the air rushing through here along that back window and then this tiny little spoiler kicks it off the end there so that means that you're not getting any water pooling on here and that all of the air that you have flying over the car just disperses now it is interesting with spoilers i learnt a lot when we did our drag parison with the 911 turbo the spoilers actually help reduce turbulent airflow behind the car which means you get less what do they call it turbulent kinetic energy i think it's called and that means that the car doesn't have to work as hard to push itself along so click up here to watch that video that was really good fun to film we go into a bit more detail about that so up the top there you can see the little camera in that shark fin aerial means that we get a digital version on the rear view mirror instead of just a standard one we've got led tail lights along the back here and then the designation for the car ev400 all-wheel drive now i think jaguar was meant to do a more powerful version of this car but given the brand has said that it won't be announcing any new models between now and 2025 when it goes full electric there is a chance here that we won't be seeing any more powerful versions of the eye pace until that time rolls around so we are inside the eye pace we'll start off with the key so there it is you've got lock unlock front boot back boot panic then on the back you have jaguar written there it's a proximity sensing case you can leave that in your pocket and then once you're inside you have a push button start just there so this car has been out for a little while now and i think the design is starting to show its age yes jaguar has gone to the effort of putting pv pro in here excellent infotainment system i'll run you through that in a bit more detail soon but there is so much blank space around there you just do wonder why they didn't go for a bigger infotainment screen given it is you know an electric car and they want to be up to date with tech even this stuff down the bottom is starting to look and feel a little bit old the screen's just small and it looks just a little bit low resolution compared to pv pro but if you put that to one side i think from a design perspective it still actually looks pretty good you got these uh brushed aluminium elements sort of splitting up the black sections then up the top it's all soft touch material that really sort of emphasizes this as being a premium offering in the jaguar range and that's all backed up by that screen ahead of the driver as well now what about your touch points so in the center there that's firmish and then soft on the door how soft are they well we've got our durometer we've tested the main surfaces in this cabin if you want to see how this car compares to others that we've tested before look at the link in the description now what about build quality so all actually feels pretty good to me i will actually mention that we had one of these as a long-term loan vehicle a little while back and the build quality was actually pretty good on it as well and door test that all sounds nice and solid let's talk about infotainment so you would have seen pv pro in some of the other jaguar android products we've tested recently we do actually have a detailed review of this you can click up here to watch that so today i'll just take you through some of the high level stuff plus a new feature that is now being rolled out to all of these vehicles with pv pro so here in the eye pace it's a 10 inch display you can actually go i think all the way up to a 14 inch display and i remember that being in the f-pace svr that we tested i thought that was such a beautiful looking screen and a great setup there but the highlights here are that you have shortcuts here on the main screen you can then scroll through and add any extra things that you want to add to that main screen as well to further customize it in addition to that you have status indicators on the side here for the vehicles 4g also your phone's reception and your phone's battery as well now on the radio front you have am fm and dab plus digital radio you can get the high-end optional sound system that adds more speakers and all that kind of thing but the standard sound system is actually pretty good in its regular form in terms of smartphone mirroring this is another update that came through as part of an over-the-air update there's now wireless apple carplay and wireless android auto i'll show you what apple carplay looks like first so there it is there pretty fast response and it takes up that whole screen as well which means you're getting that full integration you can of course then send voice commands through the car to apple carplay if you need to this is what android auto looks like so again full screen integration and nice and quick as well now let's touch on something that is new to jaguar land rover and that is the integration of alexa into their infotainment systems now you might think to yourself what is the purpose of that what's the big deal why can't i just use siri well the big deal is that it is native to the infotainment system and the infotainment system is probably one of the better units on the market today because it's instant on you get inside the car it's ready to roll your smartphone mirroring is there it is sort of ready to do everything you needed to do and when it comes to that alexa integration you're able to control your home from the car so for example if you have lights in your driveway or something like that that you want to switch on as you come home you're able to tell the car and it will then send the command through so we've set up some amazon devices at home and this is some of the stuff that i've been playing with so let's give this a shot hey alexa turn the air conditioner on and set it to 22 degrees okay hey alexa turn the lamp on okay hey alexa play car expert on youtube in the kitchen searching youtube hey alexa who is paul marrick this might answer your question according to the department of health and human services paul merrick is a physician based in winfield illinois who specializes in urology okay that's obviously not right um hey alexa who is paul martich according to wikipedia paul murray uh hey alexa who is paul merrick paul marie is a motoring journalist and based in australia there we go okay she got there in the end so what i'm trying to get at here is the alexa integration means that if you do have devices at home even devices that aren't amazon branded like the air conditioner and stuff like that you can get it to activate all of it from the car so while you are on the way home it'll do everything from here so the reason i'm excited about that stuff is because it begins that connected future with your home it means your car can actually be part of your home and can interact with your home so i'm excited to see where this takes us and where they can develop this technology from here given it is like literally just released now before i show you the screen head of the driver i want to run you through one feature here and it is the jaguar application so once you crack the application open it comes up with your car you know mileage and that sort of stuff you've also got electric details so range uh charging schedules and all the sort of basic functions you need to have active for operating the vehicle as an ev also gives you the status of what the car is doing but if you go over here to remote you can set things like you climb it out let me give it my face there you can set things like you climb it lock and unlock the car remotely and also initiate charging if you need to you have your journeys there as well so look pretty fully featured app and a big improvement over when this car launched because it used to be quite slow to actually do anything it is much faster now which is good news now the screen ahead of the driver is a 12.3 inch display you can configure what appears on the screen here uh you've got warnings on the left hand side you can even change what's on the display here so if we go down to layout we've currently got that sort of center one dial setup you can get a two dial setup back in the day when you had speedo in a rev uh gauge as well or you can go the full map display as well so look it's a good setup i just think it's probably a little bit dated this could do with a really nice refresh to bring it in line with what bmw audi and those guys are actually doing with their displays at the moment in addition to that you have a head-up display ahead of the driver all basic information there you get something you nav details speedo and also traffic sign recognition as well now safety technology you've got autonomous emergency braking you have rear cross traffic alert you have a blind spot monitor built into that wing mirror you have a lane departure warning radar cruise control and a lane keeping assistant when it comes to parking you have front and rear parking sensors and a 360 camera i'll show you what the camera looks like so there it is there it's actually a really high quality camera and then you can move the views around as part of that 360 view or you can come over here and manually select the view as you go so yeah not a bad setup there i like the way that they've integrated that and i don't know look kind of fun as well at the same time hey by the way if you do want more information on the ipace we have uh full review plus information on specification and pricing at the car expert website you can click up here to be taken to the ipace showroom let's move on to practicality and we'll start off with your connectivity so you've got one usb a port down here inside the center console you have a usb c port another usb a port and a 12 volt outlet there is also a port here for your nano sim now it's a little bit confusing but the car comes with an embedded sim you then need to add your own sim card to get connectivity to the car remotely so a little bit confusing i don't understand whether i just have both of those operating under the ones sim but it is the way that it is on the phone front where you're going to pop that well you've got wireless phone charging down the front here your phone can then live in a variety of other places as well so it's pretty straightforward there what about your coffee cup so good news there is a deep hole there if you do have american style coffee but if you have paul style coffee your coffee cup fits into there without any dramas it's easy to lift as well and then you have rubber teeth holding it into place so i'm sorry with the bottle you've got two tiers there so it's not going to really move anywhere i love the way those rubber teeth hold it into place this then fits inside the door no problems there we'll see if a big bottle fits yes it does look at that win-win on other storage you have the center console here look it's reasonably sized it's actually quite deep and then it goes under here as well so you've got stacks of room in there glove box is not too bad as well that's quite deep you've got this storage space down here if you're not charging your phone and finally you have a sunglasses holder up the top in terms of your comfort this is where you control your climate control so it has dual zone automatic climate control so you control temperatures on here but that's a pretty cool feature so you've got your screen down there you press this button at the top and it's called smart climate so it will only deploy air conditioning to the passengers that are in the car so if i turn that off i can then go over here and start setting individual climate zones but then when it is switched on it just services the one passenger inside the car and then to turn on your seat heating you can push into there and then switch your seat heating on or your seat cooling as required so really nice setup and i love the way they've integrated all of that into that display i think that feels really nice high end and premium now on the seats the seats are pretty comfortable for long distance drives they hug you in nicely too you can see the perforations on them here for that cooling and i do love the jaguar emblem there on the headrest i think that looks great so you have electric seat adjustment for both the driver and front passenger you've got a number of adjustments here so you can go forwards backwards backrest can go forwards backwards seat can go up and down you can adjust all of your bolsters there the front section as well you've got memory for the driver and front passenger and that's all part of an optional seat package that gives you all of those adjustments then on the steering front you have both tilt and reach adjustment and on our reach test all of this stuff is easy to reach while you're driving okay second row of the ipay so room not too bad there in terms of knee room toe room is pretty reasonable and head room is good i think if you're a little taller you're probably going to be rubbing up against that but i'll call this out this panoramic roof pretty sure it's optional but i think it looks fantastic they even integrated the glass around this section here so it goes all the way behind your head and i think it is a really cool look and it's naturally tinted as well so it doesn't get too hot when you do have the sun beaming on it other creature comforts you've got map pockets in the back of the seats these are your seat heater controls two usb c outlets down the bottom and a 12 volts outlet as well a little bit of storage there too you've got a center armrest here with two cupholders so bottle fits into there it's got those grip teeth so it'll hold it into position nicely and then the bottle fits no no it doesn't the bottle doesn't fit inside the doors i just don't understand why you would make doors that don't fit bottles this is a pretty standard size bottle so a little bit disappointing there you have iso fix points on the two outboard seats and top tether points as well look i think in terms of a family car this kind of meets that brief in terms of having enough room for the kids you've got air vents built into these pillars and also the safe exit assistant so it'll prevent you from opening the door if there is another vehicle or cyclist coming because kids are sometimes very eager to get outside the car finally our window test see what happens there we'll get that oh look at that almost all the way down just that little lip there but i am thankful it's not like the bmw ix which stopped like here or something like that so yeah at least it goes most of the way down so cargo space because it's a bespoke ev platform the cargo space isn't terrible so you have a little over 650 litres available here in the boot and that includes some underfloor storage so you can store your cable here and a few other odds and ends likewise down the front there and then you've got a tyre repair kit as well just in case you need it off to the sides you have some hooks if you do want to tie some stuff down 12 volt outlet plus another hook you can deploy on either side show you what it looks like with our bags in there so laptop bag there and then our full-size suitcase so you can see there it kind of pretty much takes up most of that space and then what you can also do is remove your cargo blind and once that's out of the way we can drop our second row as well and that increases space to a little under 1500 liters and there's also just under 30 liters of storage space under the front boot for things like cables now before we go for a drive i just want to run you through the charging so you have one charge port which is located here that includes ac and dc charging so ac charging can occur in single phase up to 7.4 kilowatts while dc charging on the other hand works at up to 150 kilowatts and it peaks at around 105 kilowatts now this is an interesting position i really don't like it on the taikan and here in the i-pace how your charger is on this part of the car because some of the cables on those fast chargers don't really reach all that well you've got to drape it over the car really would prefer if this was right at the front or right at the back or perhaps on both sides like it is in the thai cars so a little bit disappointing on that front also a little bit disappointing that while other brands are now capable of doing up to around that 250 kilowatt mark on a 350 charger this is still capped at around the 100 kilowatt peak mark so really do wish this would charge a little bit faster given the technology is out there so i've just hit the road in the i-pace now this is all-wheel drive that means it has one motor on the front axle one motor on the rear axle and combined they produce 294 kilowatts of power and 696 newton meters of torque quite precise isn't it and that's all mated to a 90 kilowatt hour battery the actual usable capacity of that battery is a little over 80 kilowatt hours so that gives you an idea of how much range you come to expect and that's around that kilometer mark depending on the type of measurement you're using to figure out range and this is the really confusing thing with evs we i guess it's kind of the same with internal combustion cars whenever we quote range it it's very uh i guess perfect conditions set up uh in these evs i always take like 100ks off the stated range because you know you on days like today where it's hot you want to run the air conditioner um there'll be other days when you're driving uphill towards a destination that'll use more battery or colder days so it is just worth keeping in mind whenever you see range just lop 100ks off and that should be your comfortable driving range jaguar has a combined electric economy of 23 kilowatt hours per 100ks we are currently sitting on 21.9 so under that claim which i think is pretty damn impressive as a reference my model 3 performance sits at around 17 kilowatt hours per 100k which means it uses less electricity to do 100 kilometres of driving now what does all that feel like behind the wheel and look i think you're probably getting a little bit bored of every single car reviewer in the world just going oh look it pins you back in the seat and all that sort of stuff pretty much every ev does that and it's an easy party trick because you know it's an electric motor it takes talk instantly from a battery there really isn't much science to it what they've done well though in the eye pace is giving you the torque when you need it but also smoothed it out when you don't need it so as i gradually apply throttle it's giving me enough momentum there without sort of lumping me back into the seat whereas if i do step on it it really sort of picks up that pace and makes it all happen they've also done a great job with the regen as i roll out of the throttle it's quite a strong region it feels very much like a tesla in the way that it slows down the only downside is it doesn't come to a complete stop unless you've met a number of conditions so right now we've got a slight incline and it's come to a complete stop and held it but in some situations it doesn't actually come to a complete stop and it's a little bit confusing why they have that feature if they haven't you know got a break that gets applied as the car gets slow enough so it is worth just keeping that in mind and i think they probably need to refine that regen feature just a little bit one of the big advantages of the i-pace in comparison to its competitors is its total mass it weighs a little over 2100 kilograms and that is because this sits on its own bespoke ev platform the 90 kilowatt hour battery gives you that good balance between i guess the range that you need but also it not being too heavy i think that's why the balance here is right and why the weight is so good as well some of the evs in this segment like the bmw ix and especially that top spec model weighing it over two and a half tons which is just huge and at the end of the day yes battery capacity and battery power density will improve and make these lighter but ultimately i think they need to do as much as they can to reduce the weight through the platform to start with so what's the ride like now in the sc model air suspension and adaptive damping is optional i'm going to dial this up to the speed that we went through here in the ionic 5 which runs a similar setup on the same wheel base so that is about 130 kilometers an hour and then we'll run over these yeah okay so this is suffering the same thing that the ionic 5 had really just doesn't have a great deal of body control at that top end once you do hit those maximum highway speeds and that is because you don't have an adaptive damping setup so it is forced to just manage as much as it can on its own and as a result of that it feels just a little bit floaty as it hits those consecutive bumps and they're things that you're going to experience on country roads at these country speeds in some instances and what's road noise like it's pretty good so we're doing sort of around that 100 kilometer an hour mark now on a country road here and look there is some tyre noise coming into the cabin but it's fairly civil i can hear a little bit of wing noise about those wing mirrors but for the most part it's not too bad right let's put this into sport mode so you've got your drive modes here and i'll pop this down into dynamic we've got eco comfort sport and ice but dynamics one i'm after let's plow it through this corner that's actually not too bad so it is soft in that sense that you can kind of predict what it's going to do and as you start picking up the pace it actually feels really enjoyable at higher speeds when you hit those bumps it's really soft and progressive you know exactly what it's going to do it never really surprises you and in the sport mode that throttle becomes quite sensitive so you can actually really play with it and just give yourself that push in the back whenever you want it uh let's have a look here at this faster section look at our sweeper coming up yeah the body is actually really nicely settled i'm quite surprised by that it's um yeah look i thought this was probably going to be a little worse than it is given the ionic 5 felt really i guess way too floaty over these sections even here on these higher higher speed parts when you line up the throttle it just pulls along really nicely so yeah quite impressive and look it meets the brief of being a jag right jags are all about driving enjoyment and putting a smile on your face and this really ticks those boxes and just in terms of steering feel and brake pedal feel there's a really good transition here between the regen and the mechanical braking system and likewise in sport mode there's adequate feedback through the steering wheel just to give you a sense that something is happening in the car so you know if you are after a fun ev this definitely meets that briefing you don't really need to spend money on the air suspension you know on these floatier bits it is a little sort of unsettling but for the most part it's actually quite enjoyable to drive jaguar claims a 0-100 time of 4.8 seconds this is how it went up against our stopwatch now what about your visibility so i can see clearly down the front there i think the wing mirrors could be a little bit bigger so they are okay in terms of size but you kind of have stuff lost in them and you get blind spot monitoring built into those visibility out the back isn't great it's quite a narrow envelope so you don't really see a great deal out of that and you're probably not going to be doing a great deal of off-riding i know this actually has quite an impressive waiting depth because being electric they can seal it all up and you can do a bit of light off-roading and at the launch we actually did some off-roading in these so they are capable for some light off-roading but ultimately you've only got a ground clearance of about 140 millimeters to work with so it's not a huge amount but in terms of low speed maneuvers turning circle comes in at just under 12 meters and the steering is nice and light in that comfort driving mode so the jaguar i-pace look despite it not feeling as fresh as some of the evs in this segment it's actually still a really enjoyable car to drive and it hits all the marks and ev needs it's fairly efficient it has enough room inside and it looks different enough to the others without looking too outrageous so i do like that they've integrated pv pro so that is a big step forward from the last infotainment system which was dreadfully slow uh this on the other hand is instantly there it's capable of over-the-air updates and similar to what tesla is doing you're getting new features as well like that alexa stuff that gets uploaded to the car and they don't even know to do anything about it it just appears there materially overnight um now would i buy one well this is the problem right you've got so many competitors in this segment now and they're all offering a whole lot more i guess equipment look at something like the bmw ix for example at that same price bracket it actually is a big offering with i guess even more bells and whistles in terms of technology so you really do have to weigh up your options there but if it is the drivers ev that you want the jaguar really is up there in terms of performance and putting a big smile on your face now let me know in the comments section below have you bought an ipace what's it been like to live with there are really not that many on the road here in australia but i know that some of you have bought them so let me know what the ownership experience is like in the comments section below if you did enjoy this video please make sure you share it with your mates and if you

84;Jaguar;2022 I-Pace;Jaguar I-PACE 2022 - The BEST electric SUV to buy?;refreshing welcome back to car chat tv guys my name is oliver and in today's episode i'm going to answer the question that someone asked me they've asked me what is the best all-electric vehicle suv money can buy right now now on our channel you may have seen we've reviewed the utron 55 the skoda enyak the mustang mark e the list goes on but today i'm going to tell you what the best is are you ready sitting right in front of me i'm going to show you come on let's have a look it's the jaguar i-pace [Music] ev400 let's go for a walk around first because the styling of this car is a little bit outlandish isn't it it doesn't really look like another jaguar that they produce and i like that it's very different unique we've got this gorgeous back we're going to come to the back in a moment but this is the got a black exterior pack on it so you've got black castle around the window trim it's around 410 pounds it looks good the only thing i'd probably do is i'll get the black wheels on there as well come to the front we've got this short stubby nose now the grill brilliant a lot of electric vehicles still have problems with the grill because you don't want an electric vehicle to look like an electric vehicle you want it to look like a normal car and they have done such a great design job here because not only does this grill look great it flows up you get this kind of conveyor belt kind of style as it curves up through the car the air blows all the way through this vent which looks great may i add up the car down the back and through this spoiler now the back we see here hasn't got a rear windscreen wiper because the air just comes down through the spoiler and pushes off all the water let's jump into the boot space because you might be thinking oh the styling of the car might make it not that practical but you'd be wrong because you've got 577 litres of boot space back here more than enough to put loads of stuff in now put them seats back 1453 litres cables are out at the moment but look they've even designed a little cubby a little tunnel here for you to put your cables we've just been lazy and not put them back but i love that not all manufacturers have a place for the cables we've seen that before so it's a great design down quick have a look at this you might be saying oh the sloping sport back design might restrict the space in the rear seats well look i'm in i'm 511 and this is the hse trim so i've got a gorgeous pano roof to look up you know what headspace is good i've got room to move knee space is great as well so not much to worry about is there now i'm going to jump into the front into the driver's seat and take this car out and tell you what it's really all about [Music] so i'm in the eye pace now and it is pouring down with rain so it's pretty good too to test what this is like in the pouring rain so i'm going to give you some statistics first now it's an ev400 so that means 400 fires are stark so 396 brake horsepower is what you get 696 newton meters of torque not to 60 in 4.5 seconds yes i know that is exciting and we will test that in a moment it's all-wheel drive you've got a 90 kilowatt battery pack with a range of miles can you get that real world probably not so you've got motors on the front and the back makes it all wheel drive now the only thing that's probably quicker than naught to 64.5 seconds you're looking at tesla's model s model three now the e-tron s actually can do 4.3 which is a couple attempts off this but it's a heavier car we have the e-tron 55 and it weighs 2 500 kilograms now this is a lighter car still over two tons at 2208 kilograms so it's a little bit more agile it's a little bit nippier but i'm going to tell you three reasons why this is the best all-electric suv okay number one we spoke about the naught 60 4.5 seconds i've put it into dynamic mode what does 4.5 seconds feel like this whoa you can feel that my head and there we have it oh my gosh and when you put it in dynamic road everything goes red so you've got four modes you've got dynamic mode and the steering's great it's really well balanced nice and stiff i can feel the car through the road i love that and then the other modes will go for him now so you've got comfort steering lightens up a bit and the acceleration on the pedal isn't as sensitive and then you've got you know the eco mode and the rain ice and snow but i love that this has got another element added to it the dynamic mode is brilliant now we have the e35 and that was really comfortable and it was a big car on the road this does not feel like an suv it's very saloon-esque the way you're sitting but that raw power that's something that i have not felt apart from in the tesla and that's why the performance that not 60 is at number one so number two has to be with the new 2022 upgrades to the i-pace you've got alexa now integrated and you can see it down here on the infotainment 10 inch infotainment there and that's fantastic yeah voice commands they've been around for a while but any proper effective ones probably not and the fact we all have alexa's at home you can be in your living room room saying oh alexa what range do i have left in my car it will tell you alexa did i lock my eye pace it will tell you and switch that round you can be in your eye pace driving home going alexa set my lounge to 22.5 degrees because that's how i like it alexa turn my living room light on because that's how i like it that integration of alexa that jaguar have done in their infotainment in their pv pro system is a touch of class and i'm a techie guy i really like it and that's why i've included it now in this jaguar eye pace it is so well balanced you've got 50 50 weight distribution from front to rear and it's so much fun when i was driving the econ 55 now i'm talking about that car as well because there's one we had recently and we did a review on we'll put it somewhere and it was a comfortable car but this has an added element the added element is it's fun the steering is incredible i do not feel i am in a big weighty suv i apply the brakes they work tremendously as well i'm going to take this around a few corners now just to show you because the body lean and roll is so minimal compared to that of other suvs in this category so the eqc mercedes you've got the bmw ix3 you've got the audi e-tron 55 and this the turning the steering of this car is it's really rather good and would i say it's as comfortable as the e-tron 55 no i wouldn't the utron 55 was brilliant with air suspension air suspension is an added option you can have in this car this is the hse specs you've got that nice pano roof and whatnot but this is better because you've got that comfort level the ride comfort isn't that bad it's minimal the etron 55 year is comfortable more but it's not going to put you off this because of the added element of fun this drives so good it's again i'll say that word like saloon-esque i'm not as high up in the car i'm still in dynamic mode i've got that performance when i was in the e25 and was put my foot down it wasn't there immediately and in dynamic mode so the accelerator is a lot more sensitive but i know i've finished work i've jumped into my own pace i want to blow a little bit of steam off what do i do dynamic jab and it goes immediately it's gone it's gone it's so good and it's multifaceted and that's why i love the i-pace and my number three has to be the looks of this car it doesn't look like other electric vehicles suvs out there and already in the rain i'm seeing dog walkers i'm seeing people and they're looking at me and they're looking at me going hey that's a good looking car and they are right it looks so different the big scoop in the vent for the air to flow visibility is great out the front the rear not so much but then you remember you have got that that flowing sport back and with other manufacturers you have to pay for that sport back this is included so all in all the look the appearance the style of this car is something really unique a little bit of vanguard and i think for those out there that want to have a premium suv all electric vehicle and want to be a little bit different then look no further than this so they're my three best things that i love about the car i'd love to know what your thoughts are and whether you agree or disagree let me know in the comments below inside the car you're looking for a luxury suv or electric vehicle the leather the materials are great this is some of the softest material i've ever touched on the dash i'm not gonna lie and it flows over there and you get different types of material on there a little intricate design which i really like now level on the door contrasting stitching brilliant this is the hse you expect good equipment we're going to throw back to adam because he's in the rear i want you to talk to me adam comfort and space go okay we're talking about comfort and space actually i think from the outside it doesn't look very big so from the outside i feel like it looks fairly small like the same sort of size as like a i don't know like a golf or something but really when you actually get in here you've actually got plenty of knee room let me show you so they're my knees plenty of room and actually you can see the doors that side there's actually quite a bit of room above for your head so i think i'd say it's quite spacious i've also got a baby seat in here as well so you get a full a full look at the back here um plenty of room for the cameras something i would say it's really comfy yeah i would say i'm pleasantly surprised awesome so it's an all-electric suv vehicle it's got regenerative braking but what i love is you can just put it on high harvest as much energy back into that battery and then when you turn off the car it will stay in that high mode where other electric vehicles they forget and you have to re-configure it where every time you get in the buttons and the satisfaction you get on some of these rotary dials are so good and it's a pull and a push so if you push in you've got your electric seats and your cool seats you pull it out you can do your climate control and blower and whatnot but they're really good i do like a rotary uh wheel here so we need to talk a little bit about range jaguars say that 292 miles is what this will get in real world terms i'm not so sure that's the case especially in the uk in cold february that's chilly now charging this will take maximum 100 kilowatt charger good luck finding them they are rare but if you do every 15 minutes you will add about 18 miles to your battery now in the updated 2022 a really cool thing is on board charge is now 11 kilowatts it used to be 7 kilowatts so when you charge it at home in your wall box overnight it used to be 12.6 hours till full but now it's 8.6 so you're saving yourself four hours well done jaguar good upgrade so say you're only finding a 50 kilowatt then all you need to look at then is every 15 minutes it's around 40 miles added so all in all if you're out and about and you need to charge fully it's still gonna take just under an hour to get this baby back to full charge they have updated it war box is where it's at 11 kilowatts get home park up jab it in 8.6 hours jobs done so in summary the jaguar eye pace is such a great all-rounder and then some because of that performance 4.5 seconds not to 60. and the accelerator in dynamic mode is so responsive i love that feeling i just i need to get ahead of this yeah and it helps me out i needed to get ahead someone's parked there and we've looked at three cool reasons why we talked a little bit about the updates we've talked about the charging as well now you can pick a new 2022 up for around 65 620 pounds so i want to know your thoughts what do you think have you agreed with me disagreed let me know everything that's going on through your mind right now in the comments below also with jaguar's pvpro system the cameras are great quality it's really hard to beat really if you look here we've got the camera set up and now it is raining remember but if i click any one of these we get the simulations we can see different elements of the car and it's not showing it in its greatest light but the quality is there it is raining and it's just a great feature to point out as well we just want to say a huge thank you to jaguar landrover northampton who have been really accommodating and super helpful so check them out so that has been our episode on the ipace we've even tested it in the rain for you look at today let's do a summary what have we done i've told you my reasons why this is the best all-electric suv you can buy right now i'm sure you've got something to say about it i've showed you the practical side as well that performance not to 64.5 seconds it's so much fun let me know all your thoughts about the car in the comments below throw me a like get subbed and i'll see you on the next one [Music] you
85;Jaguar;2022 I-Pace;Jaguar I-PACE Black Edition Review | Best Luxury EV?;when jaguar launched the i-pace back in 2018 it was one of the very first electric suvs to go on sale on the market and it was ahead of its time four years later however the eevee landscape has completely changed and the i-pace has a growing list of rivals to compete with this includes the audi e-tron ford mustang mackie mercedes uqc and volvo xc40 recharge to name a few in light of increased competition jaguar has updated the i-pace for 2022 with faster charging updated tech inside and subtle styling changes to include a new black edition specification in ireland prices for the ipay start from around 75 000 euro and it has an electric range of up to 470 kilometers from a single charge in this video we'll show you inside and outside the eye pace and tell you everything you need to know but before we start remember to check out carzone.edu to find jaguars for sale in ireland from trusted sellers even though the i-pace has been around for a few years now it is still one of the most distinctive looking evs on the market most recently jaguar has introduced a new black edition specification for the i-pace which updates the grille window surrounds door mirrors and badges to a black finish other black edition upgrades include a fixed panoramic roof a tailgate spoiler and premium led headlights as standard the i-pace gets silver 19-inch alloy wheels but the black edition gets larger 20-inch glass black alloy wheels which are a nice upgrade jaguar has also added some new colours for the eye pace with 10 colours to choose from fuji white is standard while this eye-catching casein blue is an optional extra all eye-based models get a huge 90 kilowatt hour battery and also 100 kilowatt dc charging as standard stepping inside the jaguar i-pace feels suitably premium throughout as you would expect from an ev at this price point the biggest change with the updated model is jaguar land rover's new pivi pro infotainment system which is similar to the system that's used in the latest land rover defender this includes a 10 inch touchscreen on the dashboard while higher spec models get another 5 inch touchscreen here for the climate controls this one is a lower spec model so it doesn't have the five inch touchscreen here however it does have lots of buttons in place for the climate controls wireless apple carplay and android auto are both standard while this one has an upgraded meridian sound system which is a must-have for music lovers the touchscreen system is nice and it is good to use but it does take some getting used to with lots of menus to navigate through especially when you're driving like before there is also a 12.3 inch digital drivers display which shows all of your driving and eva information very clearly with these nice toggle switches on the steering wheel you can adjust the different displays shown at all times when the ipads first launched through the market it had a very impressive interior look and feel and this is still the case with the latest model overall fit and finish is generally premium throughout with lots of plush materials across the dashboard and doors the i-pace that we're testing here has light oyster leather upholstery which is an 1100 euro optional extra when you sit into the eye pace for the first time it feels very spacious up front and the driving position is comfortable with eight-way electric seat adjustment as standard and plenty of adjustment through the steering wheel there's lots of storage up front too with a large compartment underneath the driver's armrest here two large cup holders which you can take out should you want to there's a useful area here for holding coins or for glasses which is what i use and also a useful tray for a smartphone there's storage for water bottles in the doors too while under the driver's armrest you get a usbc charge point a usb charge point a 12 volt socket and up front there is another usb charge point the center console area has button controls for selecting park drive and reverse along with controls to adjust the ride height of the car as this one has electronic air suspension which is a 1700 euro optional extra the i-pace is spacious in the rear seats too with good headroom for taller passengers good leg room and it is arguably better than the bmw ix3 or mercedes eqc for rear seat comfort sitting into the middle seat however isn't as comfortable this console area here restricts leg room slightly while the seat itself is quite narrow this black edition model has a full-length fixed panoramic roof which lets light into the cabin and makes it feel bright and spacious back here there's also useful storage trays underneath the seats along with helpful storage nets on the backs of the seats elsewhere there are two usbc charge points a 12-volt socket and also a large armrest with two cupholders built in it's also good that this whole section drops down easily if you want access to the boot or to carry larger items like skis there's also two sets of isofix mounts in the rear for family buyers but it is worth noting that the i-pace is only available with five seats and it doesn't have a seven-seat option like you get with the tesla model x boot space in the eye pace is good with 656 liters of room it's more than you get in the audi etron or the mercedes eqc drop the rear seats down and space increases to 1453 litres while the floor is flat which makes it easy to slide large items in and out there's also a useful storage area underneath the floor for your charge cables along with a 12 volt socket and hooks for storing your shopping bags in place there's also a small storage area underneath the bonnet which is useful for charge cables again but not much else the i-pace drives much the same as before with a huge 90 kilowatt-hour battery and two electric motors one on the front axle and one on the rear axle with 400 horsepower and all-wheel drive power delivery is instantaneous not to 100 kilometers an hour takes just 4.5 seconds under hard acceleration what stands out when you drive the i-pace is the way it handles true corners it is very enjoyable to drive and it grips the road with confidence even though it weighs 2.2 tons it doesn't feel heavy from behind the wheel with good steering feel and response it's definitely one of the best evs for driver enjoyment true corners it is much more convincing than the audi econ or the mercedes eqc the i-pace's ride quality is good and it is very comfortable even on bumpier road surfaces and with the larger 20-inch wheels on this test car generally the i-pace is very comfortable and well suited to irish roads there is two different settings for regenerative braking high and low but you do have to adjust this through the touchscreen system where most other evs tend to have paddles behind the steering wheel for adjusting it is also worth noting that rear visibility out of the cabin isn't great due to the small sloping rear window that said the i-pace now gets a 360 degree around view monitor and a clear reversing camera which reduces this issue somewhat new software means the ipace's usable battery has increased to 84 kilowatt hours and it has a claimed range of up to 470 kilometers from a charge which is more than many of its rivals we achieved closer to 400 kilometers of range during our test in cold and wintry conditions averaging 21 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers of driving there are different driving modes with eco comfort and sport but we found the eco mode offers sufficient power for most driving needs the good news is that the new i-pace now has a three-phase 11 kilowatt on-board charger whereas it previously had a single-phase 7 kilowatt on-board charger this means if you have an 11 kilowatt ac home charger the i-pace can fully charge at 11 kilowatts in around nine hours overnight whereas previously this would have taken around 13 hours in the old model in terms of rapid charging the maximum charge speed that the i-pace can accept is 100 kilowatts so it will take around 40 minutes to charge up to 80 with a rapid 100 kilowatt dc charger while that's good lots of the ipace's rivals offer faster rapid charging speeds of over 200 kilowatts including the tesla model y and even more affordable evs such as the kia ev6 and hyundai ioniq 5. that said there are still relatively few chargers in ireland that can charge beyond 100 kilowatts with a more common 50 kilowatt dc charger the i-pace can charge up to 80 percent in around 85 minutes this i-pace black edition also gets lots of safety tech as standard including traffic sign recognition with an adaptive speed limiter a driver condition monitor lane keep assist and lots more in ireland the jaguar i-pace is available in four different specifications s black edition se and hse the black edition model that we're driving here starts from 78 400 euro and it adds lots of desirable extras including the larger gloss black 20-inch wheels premium led headlights 12-way electric memory seats the black exterior design pack panoramic glass roof and lots more if you want even more spec the se starts from 96 thousand euro while the range-topping hse model starts from a whopping 103 000 euro so should you buy the new jaguar i-pace well if you're looking for a premium ev that offers good real-world range has a luxurious interior and one that is very good to drive to it is definitely one to consider that said it carries a high price tag especially in the higher specification models while some of its rivals offer faster rapid charging speeds overall the i-pace stands apart from most other premium evs on the market right now in how it looks and how it drives and for that reason it remains one of the standout options check out carzone.edu to read our full written review of the new jaguar i-pace where you can also find jaguars for sale in ireland from trusted sellers
86;Jaguar;2023 I-Pace;Jaguar I-Pace review (2023): Better than newer rivals? | TotallyEV;in 2018 there weren't that many premium all-electric suvs and indeed the jaguar ipay stood out but in 2022 we're littered with options so in this review and seeing how it compares to its modern rivals and furthermore if it's actually worth its price tag because the i-pace starts from 65 000 pounds and with the hse trim that we have on review with the options fitted on top it comes in at a whopping 79 000 pounds if you'd like a detailed breakdown between the different trim levels and as to what you get as standard do check out our detailed written review it'll be down description below now given its premium price tag one might expect a luxurious exterior design and quite frankly i think jaguar have achieved it with the i-pace see from the front it's got that kind of aggressive look and it's all somewhat reminiscent to the xj 220 whereby it's flared sort of bonnet and wings give it that sort of sportier edge as for its side profile you're treated with 18 to 22 inch alloys which you can choose from and the body colored wheel arches and side skirts give it that sort of premium extra feel speaking of which here you've also got door handles which are concealed within the frame of the vehicle and prop open when the car is unlocked a small little touch but one is definitely appreciated as for the rear profile of the vehicle you've got that jaguar-esque finish from its tail light designed to yet again this aggressive sort of look specifically given the fact that it's got that integrated spoiler at the top of the vehicle now as we transition inside the cabin the vehicle still oozes class with a choice of materials around the dashboard to the seat upholstery and even the door frames everything just looks to part at least subjectively now what takes center stage is the actual technology implementation in the 2022 model of the i-pace here you've got a 10-inch display which supports android auto and apple carplay both in a wired and wireless format now other than the third-party operating systems i should also mention that the menu layout of the ipays is a little bit convoluted it takes a little while when you're transitioning between certain menus and for example the regenerative braking selection can't be quickly accessed through the steering wheel or via button you'll just have to faff around with the vehicle settings which i just don't find as intuitive as some of its rivals nevertheless if you go for one of the more premium trims what you'll find is a secondary 5-inch display this is dedicated for climate controls and i think it does exactly what it says on the tin if you do want this on the standard level trim you'll have to pay around 410 pounds now what i do like around this area is the fact that jaguar has integrated a multi-functional rotary dials both for the passenger side and the driver side allows you to adjust the fan speed the climate controls and of course to play around with the heated seats which come as standard in every level trim it just makes the usability and the functionality of it far superior than some of its rivals that opt for a fully digitalized input instead and well it's certainly appreciated to keep the kind of retro design in this aspect now on the subject of its climate controls i should mention that the pm 2.5 filter comes in at an additional 150 pounds and similarly if you want the wireless charging pad for your smartphone which can be found just underneath the climate control settings you will have to pay an additional 305 pounds which frankly i think is ridiculous given that the overall asking price of the vehicle now what does come as standard on the plus side is a fully digitalized instrument cluster and here the 12.3 inch display gives you all the right information that you require and can be customized to a very certain degree but is nowhere near in terms of the level of customization that you can find in the likes of let's say the audi or volvo alternatives now before we transition off the use of technology i should also reference the audio system and for those who are subscribed you'll know i do dedicated audio reviews of every vehicle i get in and indeed there's one for the jaguar eye pace it'll be up on your banner down description below or indeed in the pinned comments now as standard in the s and se trims you'll get the meridian audio system that outputs 400 watts and has 12 speakers which also includes a subwoofer if however you want to upgrade to the 3d audio system from meridian you'll have to shell out 610 pounds in the hse trim however this comes as standard and it will give you 17 speakers that output up to 750 watts as mentioned do check out the dedicated audio reviews for a lot more details about this but what i will say in a nutshell is that i was expecting a little bit more from the most premium meridian audio system within the jaguar eye pace so now we get on to storage and first off let's talk about what you get within the cabin now at the front you've got a small little sunglass compartment which i find quite handy and is very similar to what you'd find in other land rover vehicles and then you've got the glove compartment as for the door bins the front two are large enough for a 500 milliliter bottle to fit alongside smaller valuables while the rear two are a little bit more limited towards the center console i did previously reference the wireless charging pad of course if you don't go for this option you'll have a non-slip bay instead which is large enough for a small size or large size smartphone further down you've got a little area where it allows you to prop for your phone upwards vertically or horizontally or if you do wish to place your key fob or some pens over here it's a small little handy storage further down you've got two cup holders and then you've got the center armrest compartment which might not seem large at first but it's not until you open it up that you'll realize that you can easily fit a medium to large size purse and or a wallet among size some other valuables such as let's say some sunglasses or a small size bottle over here you'll also find a 12 volt socket should you want to plug in let's say a dash cam our favorite round up will be down description below where you can find some of the best dash cams on the market and then elsewhere you've got a usb type-c and type-a ports which are useful for connecting up to the infotainment system via a wired format now of course as far as storage is concerned there is boot capacity now in the se and the hse model you have got a power tailgate that is fitted as standard and unfortunately that isn't as standard in the regular s model which is quite a shame given the fact that the vehicle starts from 65 000 pounds nevertheless in the hse model that we have on review it can be operated by pressing a button just above the number plate when it's a little bit dirty you can get your hands a little bit mucky but on the plus side you can operate it via the included remote or via button found within the cabin now when it does open up you have got a great sort of design at least subjectively i'm just under six foot and i can fit underneath the boot lid and means that i can just fit in goods in and out without any problem speaking of which you do not have a raised boot lip which makes it even easier and furthermore be it with a 60 40 or a 40 20 40 split which you can add in as an additional option it means that loading goods specifically elongated ones is a breeze now elsewhere you do have a flat loading bay making it all that bit more convenient and furthermore to store away your charging cables you can conceal them within the underfloor compartment storage which is fitted as standard in every level trim in the jaguar eye pace now as for total capacity you've got a whopping 656 liters to play around with and with the seats propped down you've got 1 1453 liters that makes it better than a lot of its rivals although not as large as the skoda enyak iv or the larger ldetron now in the jaguar eye pace you do also have a frontal storage compartment although it's quite limited and therefore allows you to store maybe one or two shopping bags at most or for example your charging cables the only thing to note over here is that it's not electronically operated and as a result makes it a little less convenient if you're frequenting it now despite its somewhat compact look from the exterior of the vehicle the interior of the cabin is actually pretty spacious i'm just under six foot and i've got no issues when it comes to headroom at the rear or at the front of the cabin and similarly when it comes to leg room the only thing to bear in mind is that if you do have very long legs and you're sat at the rear is that due to the kind of diagonally wedged rear seats it means that your quads muscles or hamstrings might get a little bit tired now if you're not going to use the rear middle seat you can pull it down in other words to reveal an armrest or of course you've got two cup holders as for convenience you've also got a 12 volt socket for charging at the rear of the center console and then two usb type-c ports as well now the front of the cabin you have heated front seats that come as standard in all trim levels you've also got an eight-way semi-electronically adjustable front seat in the s-trim now in the sc trim this moves up to a 12-way electric controls and in the hse trim you've got 16-way electronic controls plus heated and cooled seats which is definitely useful on hotter summer days now speaking of which here in terms of the sun that you might be getting in certain countries here the glass panoramic roof isn't fitted as standard it comes in at around 995 pound option no matter which trim level you go for which is quite a shame because i would have liked to see it as standard specifically in the most expensive hse trim and so now we get onto driving and first off i have to talk about visibility and here at the front and at the side of the cabin i've got no issues whatsoever it's easy to peer over the relatively short bonnet and as for the side the way that jaguar have designed the a-pillars and the front windows makes it easy to check over my blind spot or for example when i'm taking corners let's say around a roundabout makes it easy to see let's say if there's a cyclist approaching now the same couldn't be quite said about the rear view window because it's a lot more limited in terms of visibility furthermore when it is dirty or for example it's raining and you're not going at speed and therefore utilizing the aerodynamics of the vehicle it means that well the rear view window does get dirty and or is a little bit harder to see past now thankfully jaguar have integrated a rear view camera as standard and therefore gives you a bit more peace of mind when you are reversing so with visibility out of the way what about when it comes to driving comfort well here as standard the jaguar i-pace comes with a passive suspension setup if however you want to go for the adaptive electric suspension then you'll have to dish out an additional 1120 pounds and that's exactly what we have fitted on the model on review now what i will say here is despite the adaptive suspension presumably doing a better job than the passive suspension setup it's still a little bit stiff specifically if you compare it to the likes of the larger audi e-tron suv it's nowhere near as soft when you're going over potholes rougher terrain or let's say speed bumps here the jaguar eye pace is a bit more likened to the likes of the vw id4 the skoda enyak iv the likes of the volvo xc40 recharge twin pro and is arguably a little bit softer in comparison to the bmw ix3 and the mercedes eqa now having just referenced the bmw ix3 this perfectly leads me on to the overall driver's feel of the jaguar i-pace and here it's got a fantastic searing input a responsive accelerator pedal at least when you are on the dynamic driving mode because here the normal and eco modes will make it a lot mushier and doesn't give you that same sort of one-to-one driving aspect and furthermore the driving position that you get in the jaguar i-pace makes it almost feel like i'm driving a saloon it is almost comparable to the likes of the polestar 2 the audi e-tron gt or the likes of the tesla model 3. it doesn't make me feel like i'm driving a slightly higher rise vehicle and jaguar should really be commended for that and this makes it well quite fun to drive specifically if you're taking it on windy country roads now similarly it's pretty rapid if you were to put your foot down to the metal because i had it tested from 0 to 60 miles an hour in 4.8 seconds and while this isn't as rapid as the likes of the volvo xc40 recharge twin pro nordy quoted claims from jaguar itself which claimed that the vehicle will get to naught to 60 in 4.5 seconds i think it will definitely suffice for a lot of consumers now this is thanks to the jaguar i-pace operating on a dual motor configuration and this also means that it's got an all-wheel drive system that's in always an operation giving you again a little bit of extra know-how and a bit more extra confidence when you are driving around lit more slippery roads now combined the two motors output 294 kilowatts of power which equates to 390 horsepower and this also means that you got 696 newton meters of readily available torque and just in case you're wondering top speed is limited to 124 miles an hour which will suffice for most individuals specifically for those of us who live in the uk but if you want unrestricted roads and therefore you have the ability to go well pretty much unlimited then you might be left a little bit disappointed by the overall top speed of the jaguar i-pace now while its performance traits are pretty impressive i was very much intrigued to see how well it would do when it comes to range and this is because jaguar have integrated a large 90 kilowatt hour battery pack which is among one of the largest that one can find in an all-electric suv and here i was actually somewhat surprised to find it not actually achieve a higher amount of mileage see it doesn't seem to be as efficient as some of its newer competitors which house a much smaller battery pack nevertheless here in comparison to the roughly 270 to 280 mile claim that the manufacturer has i actually attained 240 to 250 miles from my mixed driving test which makes it on par with the likes of the volvo xc40 recharge twin pro slightly better than the likes of the mercedes eqa and a lot better than the larger audi e-tron suv however in comparison to the likes of the audi q4 e-tron the vw id4 the skoda enyak iv the likes of the kia niro the hyundai kona electric the kia soul av it is not as good whereby most of these vehicles achieve north of 260 miles at least according to my own mixed driving tests suffice to say that the jaguar i-pace will definitely suffice when it comes to range but it's not exactly class-leading despite its housing a relatively large sized battery pack now for you to retain energy back into the battery packs you can of course use redemptive braking where one can attain it by pressing down on the physical brake pedal and of course given it's an electric vehicle you can lift off the accelerator pedal and therefore let the jaguar i-pace automatically decelerate now there are two modes to choose from where you've got low and high and even in its highest mode i don't think it's harsh enough to really give you that one pedal driving approach now yes the ipas can be brought to a complete standstill by just simply lifting off the accelerator pedal but you'll need a significant amount of distance so much so that you're probably going to resort and using the physical brake pedal here what i'm trying to say is that in comparison to the likes of let's say the volvo xc40 recharge twin pro which truly gives you a good one pedal driving approach the same could be said about the jaguar i-pace it is still a little bit harsher in terms of regenerative braking in person to its volkswagen counterparts such as for example from aldi volkswagen or even skoda where they integrate around 0.3 gs of deceleration whereas the jaguar i-pace integrates around 0.4 g's of deceleration making it a little bit better when it comes to lifting off your accelerator pedal and therefore really coming to a complete standstill now of course being an electric vehicle you can plug it in and here the type 2 and ccs ports are found towards the front wing on the passenger side now the ccs port will give you up to a hundred kilowatts of input meaning that you can go from zero to eighty percent in around 45 minutes should you find a more commonly found 50 kilowatt input it will take around one and a half hours now the new jaguar i-pace has a 11 kilowatt on-board charger and therefore if you have access to a three-phase power supply it will take around eight and a half hours to go from zero to one hundred percent if you go for a seven kilowatt input and therefore don't have three phase power supply it will take roughly 12 to 13 hours and by the way if you're going for a three pin input it'll take over 30 hours to go from empty to full now finally when it comes to the driver assistance systems the jaguar ipay seems to be a little bit strived for standardized features see you will get cruise control lane assist and the traffic sign recognition system among a free other basic features that one might expect in a modern vehicle but nothing else if you want the lane positioning assistant and therefore steering assist you want adaptive cruise control blind spot monitoring system the rear cross traffic alert among a few other features you're going to have to pay an additional premium which in my opinion isn't quite justified given the fact that we are spending over 70 000 pounds on the jaguar i-pace and so this brings me on to my verdict can i see myself actively recommending the jaguar i-pace in 2022 well there are some alternatives that you should really consider the volvo xc40 recharge twin pro offers pretty much the same sort of package as the i-pace except it comes in at 50 000 pounds the audi q4 e-tron doesn't have the same sort of driving dynamics as the volvo or the jaguar but comes in at 45 000 pounds while offering the same sort of premium interior feel and further more better range speaking of which if you want even more range the skoda enyak iv offers that and also gives you better boot capacity look past these vehicles and you want better driving dynamics you've got the bmw ix3 which also coincidentally also comes in cheaper than the i-pace elsewhere past the premium badges as one might say you've got the hyundai koner electric the kia soul ev and the ki nero all of which offer a compelling package that one might want to consider at roughly 32 to around 45 000 pounds now of course that's just our subjective opinion and we'd be intrigued to hear your thoughts in the comments section below as to if and why you'd pick the jaguar i-pace over its rivals which fundamentally we think is just a bit too expensive to actively recommend now if you've liked this detailed independent review we'd very much appreciate you dropping a like subscribing and hitting that bell notification if you

87;Jaguar;2023 I-Pace;2023 Electric ?? Jaguar I-Pace review.;everyone thanks for joining me this is a review of the 2023 Jaguar i-pace I bet many of you guys forgotten about this car or probably didn't know that this car was full electric on a full charge this car can actually go 293 miles underneath the hood is an open trunk but you're looking at 394 horsepower 512 pound-feet of torque let's go ahead and take a closer look at the vehicle now underneath the hood will be Jaguar like I talked about your typical latch lift it up it's held by Hydraulics you need a little storage compartment that's pretty much it along with your charging cords closing the hood I'm sure you're seeing this huge hood scoop what's actually really cool about it is if you look at the Grille it actually swoops air in through out from the hood that actually helps with aerodynamic efficiency along with your little ear skirts on the side here which helps for brake Cooling and if I grab the keys I'll lock it there's your signature daytime running lights so of course you do have full LED and as well as your turn signals if I go ahead and lock that there you go coming off to the wheels these are beautiful optional 22 inch glass black wheels riding on 255 wood tires 40 series sidewall of course you do have your little charge port door here you can see Power forwarding mirrors flush door handles have you guys didn't unlike it kind of Falls open for y'all here's a look at the rear the Fastback roof that's pretty sleek and then you do have the LED tail lights if you can see there everything's blacked out eyepiece Jaguar badge and of course there's no exposed exhaust tip kind of looks really Beefy from the rear if you look at that it's pretty sweet let's go ahead and take a look inside the interior as we hop into the interior take a look at the door first you have tons of soft touch leather padding a metal speaker Meridian surround sound system and then you do have memory seating you have your contrasting stitching here no special LED lighting that I noticed when I did a video last night on it but you do have contrasting stitching on the seat they look really nice quite a few waste power adjustable heated and cooled seats as well hopping on in you are greeted with a fully digital display headset display a 10 inch pivy pro display and then the little screen down here is for specifically for climate controls and you're agreed with the push button for your gear selectors you have a push button stop start for an electric vehicle so it kind of makes it feel traditional coming down here you have a wireless phone charging pad does pass through you get a little pass-through all the way down here too now these systems are pretty much jlr uh current system so I won't go fully in depth with it but it's very customizable as you've seen here this is the pivypro so it does have wireless carplay over the year updates and then Wireless Android auto too the dash itself I kind of noticed as soon as I hop in kind of goes out really really far so just keep that in mind nothing special up here other than a frameless rear view mirror and you are greeted with a nice open panoramic roof and that is pretty much it with the interior cup holders storage down here that's pretty much all that is one thing is that this i-pace or at least first seen an electric vehicle I've not seen it anywhere else is adjustable air suspension and then your drive modes are here but yeah that's pretty much it for the Jaguar the cabin feels really nice I'm actually really liking this ipace first time I've been in one let's go ahead and turn off the vehicle run out take a look at the rears now one thing I noticed when hopping in and out is that fish right here comes it's like design weird where I have to kind of swoop in and it makes it feel you know struggle a little bit uh just for myself now nicely leather padded all over the seats this is a trison climate control system you do have heated rear seats I believe cooling seats are not an option but the dials with jlr if you notice that it looks like it has it but it doesn't actually have it if you have a pretty big hump or it's small but my leg space down here I kind of notice I struggle to move around so just keep that in mind but yeah hopping out I definitely hit this all the time maybe just because of the design of the door if you look at it then the door materials back here just kind of follow through from the front which is nice if I didn't show you already this is the Fastback roof let's go ahead and open up the trunk of the eyepiece this is all your storage you have a cargo cover and then that is pretty much it let's go ahead and close it and then we'll get to pricing turning to the end of the video here this Jaguar ipace was priced at 78 000 this color was finishing very easy red I personally think if you're in the market for an electric vehicle 293 miles of range is pretty decent for where we're at right now and I think the i-pace is worth a look let me know what you think Down Below in the comments if you liked the video like it if you want to see more subscribe thanks
88;Jaguar;2023 I-Pace;Jaguar I-Pace - Does this electric cat still have claws?;welcome to this week's road test review on auto EV you're probably wondering why I've got the Jaguar eyepiece here because it's not new in fact in terms of EVS it's almost pensionable the car was launched in 2018 and it was two years into its law after its launch in 2020 when we first did our first road test review and we also pitched it against the ev6 from Kia last year as a used car so why have you clicked on this video to see a road test review on a car that's five years old this isn't even a face lifted one there's going to be a face-lifted car this year at some point a 2024 model this isn't it so it's not some secret first Glimpse that we've managed to get hold of from Jaguar this is the same eyepiece that you've been able to buy since 2018. but the reason that I wanted to do a rotation view in this car was very very simple you see up until now I've always said that it's my money no object TV I think this is one of the best EVS you can buy in fact up to the point Porsche launched the taikon cross Turismo this would have been my choice and the thing with the Jaguar IP says because it's now five years old as we know the EV world moves very fast back in 2018 when it was launched there really wasn't a lot of competition out there I mean Audi was just a break to bring out the e-tron and Mercedes with the same with the eqc 400 but it still wasn't quite there yet but now there is a huge amount of competition and GI gilhov well shall we say they're kind of standing still a little bit so I wanted to know if the eyepiece is still worthy of your consideration five years after its launch in the face of much near competition and do I still hold it in such high regard well there was only one way to do that and that was to bring on a road trip to Scotland so welcome to Scotland welcome to the old Jagger eyepiece and as always welcome to Otto Evie foreign [Applause] [Music] before we get started on this week's road test review of the old Jaguar i-pace it is of course that time for I'm going to ask you to make sure you're subscribed to the O2 EV Channel then once you've done that press the little bell button that's down below because then that way you'll be notified of when our next video is uploaded and goes live once you've watched the video If you do enjoy it make sure you give a thumbs up and as always the comment section down below let us know what your thoughts on the channel and of course on the course that we review do you have a Jaguar eyepiece what's your thoughts on it what's your experiences with it are you looking perhaps at this place in the market space and have you been considering a knife piece and want to know a bit more about it well as always do let us know down in the comments so why have I brought a jacket i-pace to Scotland well it's as simple as this you see as I said it's always been the car that I've said Is My Kind Of Money No Object EV right up to the point the Porsche launched the Titan cross Jerusalem but we were having a conversation in their EV office the other day and Rod said to me said is it still worthy of the consideration we know that the EV Market moves really quickly and with the eyepiece being five years old though is it still a card you would really consider in the face of competition such as the new updated Audi Q8 e-tron Mercedes eqc 400 BMW IX and of course the taikon he said so why don't you take one on a good road trip and see if it's still got that sprinkler magic see if it still tickles your pickle like it used to so here we are back in Scotland to answer those questions is the eyepiece still worthy of your consideration but before we move on it's probably worthwhile taking a little snapshot and reminding ourselves of what the eyepiece actually is well as I say it was Jaguar's first all-new electric car launched back in 2018 and believe it or not despite its styling it is marketed as a mid-size premium SUV it has a wltp range of just over 300 miles and it's at a price point from around about 70 000 pounds all the way up to just over 90 000 pounds depending on depending on the specification and the trim level that you choose but here's the thing should you choose it should you still be considering an eyepiece given the fact that there's a huge amount of new competition out there well the only way we're going to find out is we're putting it through the road test the new card bars out they'll actually trust when it comes to make a decision on your new EVs and that is of course the auto EV one well let's kick off with styling because well look at it why would you not I think this has to be Jaguar's best looking car since the original E-Type now Jaguar is a brand let's just quickly give us a little bit of a history lesson when it comes to Jaguar because there was a time when there was just seen as a bit of an old man's car I think they thought that retro styling was the kind of way forward and it never used to be that way if you look back to the 1940s and 1950s the 1960s were cars such as the XK 120 the XK 140 XK 150 the E-Type the xj6 the xjs of 1970s and I don't care what you say that is a real standout car that was way ahead of its time and it was really much misunderstood the xjs and only now people are looking back thinking that's a good looking car but to my eyes this is right up there with the E-Type is one of the best looking cars that Jaguar has actually ever produced I think it's an absolute stunning car and again a bit like I've always said if you can launch a car today that's as old as this and it still looks fresh and it still looks this good then its design is absolute on point and it's a real classic I love the way the eyepiece looks I think it's the best look I think it's one of the best looking cars on the road let alone one of the best looking EVS not even just the best SUV look at it in column took away all that kind of retro styling and brought the brand right up to date he's kind of angry cold headlights where they can L sorry the j-shaped um drls running through there now the car does have a grill which is a bit odd because you don't need it but it was going to drag your signature now the new 2024 model car is going to have all that filled in whereas here it's a sort of mock Grille but there is a significant bit of styling here because just under there is an airflow sort of spoiler the airflow goes in there and comes out there the top of the Bonnet to give a real aerodynamic shape so that is important that needs to be there and as I say it's got the Jaguar face on it as well you've got extra cooling down at the bottom there and again some nice vents at the side that just take the airflow around the side of the wheels as well you've got your big Jag your Growler matron in the middle there which is fantastic and as I see the whole thing just kind of hunkers down and whilst the front has a real presence about it it's in the side profile where we really see callum's genius at work and it's this line here you see it and it runs up over the top of the wheel Arch all the way along right to the back of the car this is a stunningly sexy looking car I make no apologies for using that one so I'm sorry if it's offended somebody look at the way this thing just curves over there and really hugs down that front wheel it looks like a cat ready to pounce obviously and then you've got this lovely kind of swooping long roof line into this rear spoiler here the recessed door handles that pop out when you open the car so its overall shape is on fussy and really stylistic but it's the details as you go around it where you start to really see the best qualities of the design this little bit down here the way these Lanes come along and then come up there and then mirrored up here you'll see that all around the rest of the car like in the rear light signature and the rear spoiler and it's the way it's that attention to that detail that I love about this design and as I say the market as an SUV but I don't think it is I don't know how to describe the eye Pace really because it's not a big tall high riding thing like a an IX BMW IX it's not really an estate car like the taikon cross Turismo it's just like a kind of big Sports hatch now you does have adaptive air suspension so you can actually raise the right height of the eyepiece and it does have some more fraudibility because it is a dual motor car so therefore it's all-wheel drive and but it's not something you'd go plugging through sort of like you know the Wilderness in like you may be wooden um you know something like you know so the Toyota bz4x or the Subarus or Terra that we tested the other week but even so it's certainly something you could see maybe with a nice set of winter tires on taking on a skiing trip um or certainly getting you down I kind of I can Farm track if you live at the end of it but the design of the whole thing just I just love this car so much the one thing I will add however you've got to have big wheels on it this is these are 22 inch Alloys on this car this particular test car anything smaller than that looks a little bit under tired in my eyes and it's one of those cars like a concept cars we see some of these ridiculously big wheels and they never ever make production with them this is the one car that really does need the big wheels and it certainly doesn't affect the ride and handling as we'll see when we drive the car but let's have a look around the back because the whole thing truncates into this lovely shot rear end look at the rear overhang there there's hardly any of it the wheels are pushed right out to this to the extremities of the car which gives a real long wheelbase and really good cabin space and a car that's actually quite short overall in comparison with cars as the BMW IX and the Audi e-tron so that's probably helps give it that real kind of compact nature and that can a real look there's a tiny little bit of kind of plastic just there which is almost like a day again to help a little bit airflow into stop so the paintwork getting damaged by those big wheels chucking up some bits of debris from it right the rear spoiler this is what I'm talking about can you see that line there how it just kind of comes up and down and that's the same just reminds me of that little section there and these rear lights let me see if I can get these to flash because when they come on look there it is there again you see that's that side cell section that bit there that's just mirrored in that real light genius absolutely brilliant as I say it's their attention to detail that stands the card above things like the BMW IX in my opinion it's just a wonderful looking car you've got this little kind of spoiler along here which is just put in the back just to add airflow there's no rear wiper on it and that does bug me um obviously because any car doesn't have rear wiper does annoy me but again like the front what they've done is they've got a gap there so as the airflow comes over the roof it's the whole thing's designed to take away any excess water and kick it off now as I say I've driven a car up to Scotland it was raining the other day when I came up hence the reason why I've washed the car um does it work sort of you do get sort of like little vortices kind of running down there to the water and as I say it's in the morning when you're kind of driving out where you need that if it's defrosted where you just want to give it a quick clear but we all know my thoughts on the lack of rear wipers and car so I won't labor it eyepiece badge there the big bold Jaguar leaper there with the jagged badge there and I see it's low set number plate down here rear diffuser right down at the bottom no pretense to be an off-road on this car at all so there's no big chunky wheel arches or any kind of four by four if that makes sense um it sort of like cladding or anything like that it's just a neat pretty good looking piece of design in my opinion but what do you think if Jager launched this car today would it still turn your head is it still as good looking a car as it always was or am I completely wrong are there better looking cars out there as Ian Khan designed a better looking car than this if you take out the Aston Martin Vanquish and db7 as always let us know your thoughts in the comments section down below but yes it's a slinky ship but that doesn't make it not practical this boot size is 557 liters as standard which makes it 57 liters bigger than the BMW IX which is as you say I like the car but it is a big car but offers quite a small boot this is bigger um it's got a um a 40 40 20 split on the rear seat as standard and that takes the boot size up to 1453 liters and the O2 EV suitcases I don't have with me because I'm up visit my mother and I don't need a suitcase so I didn't bring them so apologies but they do all fit in there because I have tried it and boot space wise what other practicalities have we got well we've got little hooks at the side there just to hang bags of sharpening you've got some good chromed tie-down lashings there you know if you need to sort of put a netting down just to keep things hunkered down and you do get some good underfloor storage for your cables as well and as well as that there is also a small space up at the front as well where you could put sort of like an additional cable and um or I don't know like a muddy dog leader whatever you've got with you that you need to put in there which I'll show you too and solid original rigid parcel shelf um which is very good because it's very secure but as I say because of that rear kind of sloping roof line and obviously with things like the the Privacy glass as well it's all kept neat and out of the way so yes a very practical car so up front there is a small space not huge it's not tesla-like but it's probably enough as I say if you want to put in an additional charging cable um you make a small kind of bag in there or oh I suppose if you're out walking or something you had a a wet jelly or something like a wet jacket you could pop that in there or a wet dog lid or whatever so it's probably just enough for what you might need now rear seat accommodation okay it's not as good as the BMW IX back in here so I will give it that but it's still ample it's still a good place to be you've got a relatively flat four I mean it's it's based on um excuse me based on a brand new platform or it was at the time of launch although it so it doesn't share it's not a combustion engine platform that's been modified it's not like a an f-pace that's been changed for it it's not but you do have a slight raise there in the middle of the floor there so that's the only kind of down so it's not a completely flat floor however the upside of that is it doesn't feel that the floor has been pushed up for the outer two passengers so you can actually get a really nice seating position and your legs are nicely down now the driver's seat set up for myself and as you'll know I'm five foot seven five feet eight excuse me and I've got plenty of legroom back here um even a middle passenger would be quite comfortable sat in the middle there because the seat is relatively flat across the back um isofix points nice and easy to get to they're covered on the outer two seats um and we've got relatively good storage so you've got the seat pop them the Nets back in there we've got rear climate control on this particular specification car and with you know something fan speed and directional um uh adjustment there and then of course you've got connectivity ports down there you two USB ports and a 12 volt socket as well so that's all good there's door bins although they're not huge but you probably could fit like a child's water bottle in but probably not my big one and you've got that folding armrest down in the center with an additional two cup holders and as I say that middle section that 20 bit there the 40 40 20 will fall down as well so if you've got longer loads like skis or fishing rods or whatever you want to get through then you certainly can so as I say it's not bad back here headroom's good I think if you were taller than me at six foot you'd start to feel a little bit more enclosed in on a side bit but this massive big glass roof that the car comes with and just lets the carbon flood in with light it is an option and it depends on the spec you have and we'll go through that pricing but it does it is something I probably would have if I was looking at an eyepiece because I see it just lets a lot more light into the car it doesn't open it just gives it this lovely big glass roof across the whole ceiling of the car so yeah as I say it's not the biggest in its class that's probably going to go to things like The IX and the Audi e-tron but you certainly do not feel shortchanged if you had to do any type of Journey back here whether it's a child or an adult now like the exterior the interior is a complete departure for a jagger if you have envisaged something wood and leather and the smell of cigars an old stale whiskey it's nothing like that again it's a modern interior it looks fresh even five years on in my book let's start with the driving position now the first thing I'll say is I've now driven the eyepiece with all its seats if you like all the different seats you can have in it and this is the standard Sports seats and these are the ones I would probably choose the you do get performance seats which was in the car that we had last year when we put up against the ev6 from Kia and we've got that kind of One Piece backrest they're good they're very nice I do like them but I do prefer these Sports seats they've got just a bit more adjustment you can actually adjust the length of the squab electrically to give you more support there and they hold you just enough while still giving you that really nice kind of soft kind of coziting feel that you would expect from something within the Jaguar badge you face this lovely three spoke sport steering wheel that's just just nice to hold it's got the right kind of Garth to it's the right diameter three spoke design looks modern looks fresh you've got buttons on it which do look touch sensitive but they're not you physically got to press them to make it actually work and which is good as well which I like you're straight down into this driver's Pinnacle which you can configure depending how you want it so I've got it set up with two dials and then in the middle you can have you can change the infotainment panel and it can either be a navigation it can be your driver assistance trip computer the media playing obviously back to navigation you can also have it so that you have um just maybe one dial in the center and then media and navigation up there or again more information about your trip as well so you can really configure the dashboard how you want it you move across here now and that was the biggest change since 2018 I think it was in 2020 the card got the new Jaguar Land Rover pivy Pro system so you get this 10 inch touchscreen display which is good it is it is it's all right um you know it's fairly quick to respond it's not the best in the class it's not as good as BMW's eighth generation operating system I don't think um Mercedes is probably a little bit better as well but it's certainly not bad at all and it feels of good quality and if you may be coming from I don't know maybe a Range Rover Sport or something you're thinking about going all electric then a lot of that will be familiar to you you get standard Apple carplay and Android auto as well which is Wireless talking to wireless that's your wireless charging pad down in there and then depending on the spec that you go for will depend on your climate control panel now the specs are going to change for the 2024 facelift um this is a this is an older cost this is an HSE model and this has got the smaller five inch uh display here so you've got the climate control system which is down here now you can adjust your airflow with a touch screen and you can adjust the other sort of things with either touch sensor buttons around it or by these two rotary controllers which some people don't like but I absolutely love once you get used to what they do they work really really well so if you don't do anything with them you just literally turn them that is your temperature setting and it feels like a nice bezel and a proper dive watch that's what I like about it and just everything you touch the materials used just feel right anyway um and then if you push it that's your seat control so you've either got the ventilated seat if it's on optioned on this car um or go to the right and that's the heated seat and then just release it and back to zero and then if you pull it then that's actually a fan speed so it really works or you can just flick it to Auto or trying to claim it off or you can use the seat heating here on the screen itself depending on what you want I think it works I like the fact it's always there and once you get used to where the buttons on how to use it it's actually quite easy to use on the move um transmission control here so drive neutral reverse and park the opposite way around a lever would be parked reverse neutral drive but again just get used to it and it's fine and then you've got different buttons down here depending obviously what you want so cruise control um which obviously it operates from up here as well and then your driving modes there traction control off and then your air suspension adjustment is there so you can raise and lower the card as well if you're going off-road with it storage is good you get a little slot down in there two cup holders enough to take my big coffee flask and water bottle and then a center um copy in there you do also get a glove box of the car which is a decent size and decent sized door bins the other thing that's worth mentioning is the mirror um so again this has got I think it's called Clear Sight so you've either got it's a bit like the little Honda East you've either got a normal mirror or if you flick it it now becomes the rear camera display so it's showing you what's right behind your via camera and it works really well um despite where the camera is quite low down in the car I come up the m6 they're doing really grotty weather and it still stayed pretty clear I have to say um I'm not sure what I prefer whether I just prefer a normal mirror whether I prefer the camera view but at least you've got the option of either or if you want but as I say the feeling of quality in here is is something to be discussed because again I appreciate Jagger maybe haven't had the best reputation when it comes to things like that but trust me when I tell you this this feels like a proper premium product car um you've got this lovely kind of sort of like metal um around here which feels nice and cool to the touch all the controls because I've got a nice solidity to them so when you press the buttons or use the column stalks they click in a really nice way the materials around you know there's not a cheap feeling part you could maybe argue this like this little bit of plastic down here or the fact there's a bit of piano black here and there which you can change by we can change that veneer is a little bit old heart and maybe it doesn't like it isn't as modern as you might want it to do but that would be it everything else you know soft touch on the dash here and then there's different kind of leather feeling up here and then Alcantara roof lining and then they say everything you touch the door controls everything just has a real proper more quality to it that I absolutely love with the Jagger the driving position is perfect you don't have that kind of tall elevated kind of SUV like driving um thing that you may be getting things like you know like the IX or the odetron you sit low in the case in The Jug you're not on it and it's got a real sporty feel to the driving position which is good because you'll see that when we drive the car it just feels right and it just kind of feels like the whole car can envelops itself around you when you're driving it and that's quite nice because you've got these two kind of distinctly separate um you know driver and front passenger kind of feel around like an open cockpit feel now some people do like that I prefer that can a more individual side of it but I feel all the controls are around me and so depending how you feel it might not be you but for me I think this works um and I think like the outside it's one of Jagger's best interiors that they've ever done I think it's a real Cork and as I say it's the quote it's the feeling of quality as well as that sort of real kind of design touch that's abound in here it's just the same as the outside and to me it still feels as fresh as as it did the day it was launched five years ago if there's one place the eyepiece is maybe starting to feel its age it's in its battery system now it's a 90 kilowatt hour battery which is big and it should give according to wltp figures a range of 292 miles but its charging speed is only 100 kilowatts meaning that if you're going from your benchmark 10 to 80 percent it's going to take around about 45 minutes now obviously more modern cars such as the BMW IX Kia zv6 Hyundai Sonic 5. um two cars which you might also consider given price point which we'll talk about later they've got much faster charging speeds Porsche taikan 800 volt architecture it charging speed is much much faster so that is a bit of a downside with the eyepiece if you stumble across a more likely 50 kilowatt charge and that takes that 10 to 80 Benchmark to about an hour and a quarter so there is that trade-off to make if you're charging up from your home seven kilowatt wall box and then you're looking at around about 13 hours to go from Flat to full but from 2020 almost Jagger did fit an onboard 11 kilowatt charger a standard to the car so if it's that three-phase electricity and you've got it home then obviously that time will drop down now I've quoted wltp figures again and I'm conscious I do quote that a lot so and I I should really have recorded a bit more of the efficiency on my trip up here but let me give you a little synopsis of my trip up um on Friday so it's 350 miles give or take a couple of miles from my house to my mother's house and look at me from my house and study and to my mother's house in Lockerbie um and I started with a battery level of around about 93 and it was shown about 200 and I think it was about 232 miles and I charged twice on the way up to Scotland so once it's Stafford and we're uh the the the Newbie pulse uh fast charges at Stafford Services North um and then again Porsche Center uh South Lakes and then arrived up in Lockerbie with more well I'd probably see how it was arrived in Lockerbie with slightly less than 100 miles of rain showing so it's pretty good in terms of its efficiency considering the weight and the size of the car and also the fact that I was sitting on a Motorway cruise control on at around about 17 miles an hour mark you know air con on Bluetooth music playing and just constantly on Motorway so it's not bad In fairness um but as you see it's probably the one area where we need Jagger to maybe sort of like you know the next model that comes out whether it's a new ipace or whether it's the next generation of cars where I'd really like to see like that electric architecture move into where more of the competition are certainly that we've seen from like Zakia Hyundai and Porsche now so are there any surprises for me know that I'm back buying the wheel of an eyepiece no um but that's a good thing because it's always been a car that I've absolutely loved to drive and it's a real driver's car as you say I keep kind of just you know I can't get my hair during this whole SUV thing when Jack you say oh it's an electric SUV and that's kind of how they do marketing fairness but if you think of an SUV like a Land Rover Discovery or even things like the BMW IX Mercedes-Benz eqc 400 Audi e-tron that's not the eyepiece it's difficult to describe and it's probably why I love the um Thai Kai cross Turismo so much because it's a similar type of car it doesn't feel like some big bulky thing it feels like something life something that's a bit more Dynamic something that you can really take by the Scruff of the neck and throw it down an Audi a drone and a BMW IX as good as they are would not see the way on IPS when down a twisty Road they wouldn't even know where it had gone now in terms of power when it came out back in 2018 it probably felt like 400 horsepower which is what the eyepiece has and still has was a lot of power and in two intense purposes it is it's not to 60 time is running about four and a half seconds it is a fast car but it is so much more than just fast it's the way in which it delivers the power it's the way in which the car actually makes you feel as a driver have always had I mean grace space and Pace was always the Mantra way back in the 60s and I don't think there's a jagger that that better applies to than the eyepiece if I'm honest with you because you've got quite a commodious car um and because of its quietness because of its refinement it can be quite Cornish it sounds graceful and my gosh it does pick up at Scots and goes when you need it to let's talk about the driving dynamics of it um from the driving seat so the first thing that you notice is the steering oh the first thing I sat on this is the steering it is perfect it to me it is the perfect weight um of a steering it's got a Precision to it that I found lacking a lot of newer EVS it you know exactly where the front wheel is you go for an apex and an ipes and you can get a millimeter perfect as far as I'm concerned it's got just the right amount of heft to it it's not too heavy but and it's just that you you pitch into a band like this and it's just that roll of the wrist and there you've got it and you know exactly what the front wheels are doing so that's the first thing that really speaks to me is the way the stealing acts with you it's got a real kind of old-fashioned kind of mechanical feel to it and it's got a real kind of performance car feel to it the the second thing that really grabs you when you're driving the eyepiece is the suspension and the chassis Dynamics now chassis engineering to me is a dark art I sort of understand it in terms of what you have to try and Achieve could I do it myself absolutely no way and to me there are certain people that need to be held up on pedestals when it comes to chassis Engineers Richard Perry Jones God Rest his soul Who Made Who who engineered the first Mondeo he was one um Mike cross who did who did this he's the other because he has got this spot on as far as I am concerned there is the right amount of feel coming from the chassis balanced with the right amount of comfort now I'm not saying that you don't feel the bumps you do it's primary right you know exactly what the road surface is like you could put a pee down on this road and I could drive over and I could tell you where it was but that doesn't make it uncomfortable it's secondary ride the damper tuning on this car is phenomenal it doesn't float it doesn't bounce it just stays absolutely resolutely flat and as a driver you know exactly what is going on underneath you and the blend of the performance the steering and that as far as I'm concerned adds up to a car that is absolutely unsurpassed in its class if you class it just as those big SUVs you throw the tie can into the mixture and it's another car the same as this it's just got that blend that just for me feels right absolutely right um driving modes there's three you get equal comfort and dynamic and that's down here um I don't bother with Eco and anything like that you click it into dynamic and you put your foot down and yes you can feel it of course you can as I say there's that 400 horsepower is not a small amount of power but kind of when you've got hot hatches that are kind of getting on that sort of level now and obviously with the added weight of an EV it's not the startling figure that you get and see something like a BMW IX M60 and as much as I like the ixm60 and I do like it it doesn't drive like this this just kind of shrinks around you as a driver this kind of makes you feel like you're really making stuff happen and I just love it I really do I don't think there's another car in its class that comes even close to the blend of abilities that the eyepiece has anyway there we go um so yeah so three driving modes comfort's a nice one I've pretty much kept it Comfort on this trip to Scotland uh and
89;Jaguar;2023 I-Pace;2023 Jaguar I-PACE: The Latest Premium EV You Should be Considering;with jaguar choosing to skip the 2021 model year due to supply chain issues the 2022 ipay saw significant updates which are transferred into 2023. starting at 71 300 u.s or 99 800 canadian before destination fees or tax credits these features are standard premium led lights up front 20 inch wheels with a standard air suspension an all-new pivi pro infotainment system with over-the-air updates and standard adaptive cruise control with searing assist pre-collision braking blind spot monitoring lane keep assist and a rear view camera with cross traffic alert just to name a few for 2023 the current standard heads up display becomes optional a 360 degree surround view camera is available along with a rear view digital mirror the current android auto and apple carplay connections become wireless and is complemented by standard wireless mobile charging with amazon alexa compatibility with optional wi-fi also unchanged from 2022 into 2023 is the power and available trim level which essentially is just one that being the hse trim however you do have the option of purchasing either a black or bright exterior pack which adds either chrome or gloss accents to your eye pace in 2023 the i-pace is still going to be equipped with a 90 kilowatt hour battery pack 84.7 which is usable and it's still going to produce 394 horsepower with 512 pound feet of torque and all-wheel drive continues to be standard with no option of front wheel drive and when it comes to range stick with these standard 20 inch wheels as opposed to the new 22 inch wheel option which will be offered in 2023 because jaguar estimates the 20s will allow you to reach up to 246 miles in 2023 with the optional 22-inch wheels only delivering an estimated 217 miles in range as for charging levels and times level one as per usual is going to be very slow even when aided by the 11 kilowatt on board charger but the on-board charger does help the i-pace recharge when plugged into a level 2 at-home charging unit or roadside tower speaking of level 2 charging you can expect up to 22 miles of range with a 60 minute charge or you can fill up overnight at home within 10 hours level 3 however offers a dc fast charging connection and jaguar has made a vast improvements to their fast charging capabilities now you can expect up to 78 miles of range with a 15 minute charge in 2023 a few i-pace competitors include the tesla model y the volvo xc40 recharge mustang maki and genesis of gv60 just to name a few look down in the description below for my real world charging times and competitor battery range amounts two more features affecting range is braking regeneration and definitely driving mode so braking regeneration inside your eye pace to activate it you have to go through your pivipro infotainment system when you do activate it now you'll have that opportunity to do one pedal driving and essentially that will allow you to come to a stop without using your brake pedal and that will also reduce wear and tear on your brakes braking regeneration essentially is when you are lifting off the accelerator your battery will recharge itself slightly then your driving modes will also impact your battery range significantly okay you are able to go from zero to 100 within 4.5 seconds inside your eye pace one dynamic mode is set up now personally in between eco mode and dynamic mode i experienced an 8 mile range difference in an instant when i go between those two particular driving modes to switch your driving modes on the fly just use the buttons located down here it's really easy to do and then it will indicate through your digital driver cluster what mode you're in you have several different driving modes you have your eco you have your comfort you have dynamic then you even have configurable dynamic and you also have rain snow and ice if you're an active individual or just an active family in general and towing capabilities is important to you speak to your jaguar specialist before towing anything because currently within north america we do not receive a tow rating with the i-pace whereas european buyers you receive a tow rating of just over 1600 pounds jaguar does suggest that you'll be able to store up to 165 pounds on top when your eye pace is properly equipped now if a motion activated power liftgate is important to you speak to your specialist because that's valued at a hundred dollars as an option but your power liftgate is standard on your ipace and you can use your key fob to pop it open you could also use your key fob to pop open your front trunk but then you'll have to manually put it up from there in terms of cargo capacity you have a cargo capacity of 25 to 51 cubic feet and the difference there is really determined by if you choose to keep your seats up or down speaking about these seats these seats fold in a 40 20 40 split why i like that is because if you are an active family you'll be able to store longer items down the center and remember i mentioned your eye pace is equipped with a standard air suspension so you can lower it down making it easier to lift heavier items in i also recommend purchasing the optional rubber mats this will just help keep everything cleaner and the standard cargo cover can also be easily stored beneath it so that's super convenient when it does come to these seats the convenience can be improved because you have to manually put them down however you do have smaller hooks back here you do have a 12 volt port and a strap for smaller items if you're looking for additional storage space and your items are small while underneath your floor trunk you can store smaller items there and you'll also find your tire mobility kit in 2023 you will have the option of a spare tire the jaguar i-pace is a five-seater suv but it's also a performance crossover meaning space back here can get a little bit tight but if you're familiar with my channel you know i'm only five foot three so i never complain about lag or head space but my producer who's five foot eleven he fits just fine as well these rear seats are also heated if you prefer four zone climbing control that is an 800 option in relation to storage this is where it gets good so up front really good and then you have additional storage down the center and your front center console is amazing because the storage is so deep and then back here back here on the sides of the doors it's a little bit narrow but i like the fact that you have the storage behind the front seats but then you have hidden storage for snacks and water bottles underneath your seat so that's really good as well for connectivity this is really really good i have zero complaints so your connectivity up front you'll find beside the front passenger leg you'll find it inside your front center console and then rear seat passengers enjoy two usb c ports and a 12 volt port then when it comes to this panoramic sunroof which is stunning and well tinted you have the option to purchase a sun blocker which you can manually install and then take away as well when you want to uninstall your sun shade well then you can just store it inside your trunk underneath your floor mats jaguar suggests that they offer the best in-class warranty coverage through their elite care program i'll provide that information down below now these seats are both heated ventilated power operated offer lumbar support and thigh support they also have memory functions as well on either side this steering wheel is also heated but if you prefer a heated steering wheel you have to speak to your jaguar specialist because that's part of the cold weather package the rest of this wheel is just amazing it fits your hands comfortably and offers great character on the left hand side you're going to find your voice commands and your bluetooth you'll also have your button for your meridian audio sound system which is fantastic also your digital driver cluster is just that it's fully digital you can operate and adjust a lot of your safety features using your digital driver cluster so for example if you don't like your heads up display well you can just deactivate it but when you deactivate it and you're also using it for your navigation system well then you can switch your digital driver cluster to display a 3d version of your mapping it looks really good and remember the heads up display is only an option for 2023 on the right hand side this is where you'll find your adaptive cruise control settings in the eye pace it's semi-autonomous for about 15 seconds and then you'll have to hold the steering wheel again just touch it for a moment it senses that you're there and then it will be autonomous again one of the standout features from this past week is this pivi pro infotainment system it's so easy to use so it's a touch screen and a swipe through i recommend when you sit down with your jaguar specialist ask them about the shortcuts so there's a gear icon on your right hand side or a four square icon on your left hand side you push that and a lot of those features that you're going to need daily for example like knowing what's going on with your battery range is all right there or if you don't want to look to your right it's always going to be displayed inside your digital driver cluster but that's what i recommend is sitting down going through those two icons when you do push the gear icon on the right hand side it's going to come up with four additional options for a screen so push the all word and then that's where you'll be able to customize a lot of the features that's going on with your eye pace but like i said it's easy now for your climbing controls very similar to what i experienced in the land rover these knobs are multi-functional so if you pull them out they do one function when you push them in they do another and then you can turn everything on and off by using the small digital screen remember i mentioned those driving modes i told you they're located here on the right hand side so choose the feature that you like or i should say the driving mode you like which is dynamic for me then foot on brake push the d for drive now let's hit the road so here's a fastback for you your jaguar i-pace like i mentioned comes equipped with a standard air suspension but when you're traveling at over 65 miles an hour or above it automatically lowers itself by 0.4 inches reducing drag and improving range efficiency so that's really nice and that's what my week with the i-pace has been all about really nice comfortable smooth and premium premium quality the finish of it has just been really nice and i like the updates jaguar has made to the infotainment system because it really is easy to use and the navigation system i love the fact when i put in a destination it automatically calculates how much range i'll still have when i get to my destination so that's nice and it gives you so many options with different charging points too and it even tells you what type of connector and how many connectors or i should say charging towers are at that particular location so that's fantastic because that makes it really convenient and takes the the guessing out of it you know like how many charging towers are there what's available all that stuff so all that is taken away but the driving modes 100 if you enjoy going back and forth between eco or dynamic that will change your range by a lot so pay attention to that it really didn't make much of a change when i use you know like my audio and my climbing control that really didn't matter too much but overall the sound quality is fantastic it's so quiet i love the braking regen in here i like how they did it's not overly aggressive visibility out the front the sides there's no blind spot out that third window the one thing i would change is probably this panoramic sunroof so i love it because it's huge but i like more the feature inside the bmw ix where it's like one touch to expose and one touch to shade in the jaguar they do probably a better job with their standard tint but i don't like the manual shade but it's an option right but what i like to do in all my videos is recommend a test drive because test drives are complementary so guys look down in the description below because i try to make your purchasing experience easy for you but for now i'm julianna your automotive woman make sure you subscribe and hit that notification bell so you

90;Jaguar;2023 I-Pace;Jaguar I Pace Review in 2023! Tesla Model Y Killer?;hey what's up guys it's techsumer talking to you here and in today's video I want to review the Jaguar EV you see standing behind me yes this has been my daily car for the last year and in 2023 I want to review it because we got tons of competition for this car we got the model y got the new Audi e-tron Q8 we got so many SUVs on the market the Kia ev6 even the Hyundai ioniq five so many cars that you have on the market right now that can compete with Jaguars EV this was the first easy on the market this car came out in 2017. can you believe it 2017. this was one of the first EVS to hit the market but in my opinion it's still one of the best this tiny SUV which is not that tiny has about 400 horsepower and can deliver 0 to 100 in about 4.6 seconds it has tons of space on the boot on the front on the back it's super practical and in my opinion it's one of the most fun EVS to drive I've drove tons of Tesla's Model S model X model 3s model wise and even the Kia ev6 that are on F5 and I can tell you that this Jaguar EV feels like a Jaguar when you drive it so of course in today's video I want to review it show you all the quirks and features tag Dr Muro and of course tell you if it's worth it to buy or not in 2023 so if you are excited this video will have tons of drone shots it will be exciting different video for me but I love making car videos so if you do also don't forget to drop back down below and subscribe to my channel let's get started so let's first start by the looks of this car and as you can see now behind me this car is not top picked or tiny it's normal I do believe that the looks of this car are in that point where it looks like an EV but it also looks good it's not that weird looking AV but it's also not that bad I do believe that the Jaguar i-pace although it's 5 years old or 6 years older design it looks insanely cool still in 2023 let's take a walk behind it and see if you like it or not and also inspect the quality of the manufacturing because tens of EVS nowadays have this problem especially Teslas let's go check it out so we can start here from the front as you can see we have these nice wheels these nice rims which are from the factory actually this is not no third-party upgrade this is from the factory one of my favorite wheels on this car and here on the front you can see I have this very weird but very aerodynamic shaped design it's in my opinion one of the best looking EVS on the market I actually love this design and you can see already the protruding door handles and of course the charging ports going along your hand you can see that you have the Jaguar EV of course there and yes this is a Jaguar like other Jaguars looks amazing I love it so so much then also of course we have this other rim and door handle we which looks really cool this pops out and reveals the back which extends on Space you can see there but let's not get inside right now and talk about more of the design on the exterior the rims are cool like I told you let me go into the back which is also one of the more controversial parts of this Jaguar EV but in my opinion one of the best parts that make it look so so cool you have the i-pace logo and the ev400 tagging the 400 horsepower that you have on this car insane insane performance later on I will open the boot to show you how good and how special it is you have these very cool detail that you can see here on the back goes along of the back wow love it this car is so good looking I love driving around and for the price that it is which is around seventy thousand dollars I think it's a pretty good buy this side is about the same you have these tires these wheels and again the Jaguar EV on the side and no port on this side just like the Audi each one that has two boards the Porsche icon this card only has on the port on the left side it uses CCS you also have this weird opening here that you can see on the front and this is for air intake so the air comes through and improves very very much the aerodynamic of this car because the air comes from these fenders you can see from the side here this Fender comes downwards and from this Fender the fenders go the air goes to the side of these fenders like so and then comes upwards here this improves very much aerodynamic because it's a pass for the hair to push through and saves on efficiency and gives this car with 400 horsepower and an 80 kilowatt battery gives it around 450 kilometers of range which translates to about almost 300 miles or 270 miles on Miles so let's now talk about one of the best features that this car has and many other cars don't have which is the Frank yes this car has a front and and it's so weird because nowadays most of the EVS have things on the on the front and this car has a front which is very useful when you want to carry things around you can see that I popped it and then if I have to lift it up it's not easy to lift it up and you have to find the place where there's the handle let me see what it is oh yeah I found it so you have to found find it like it's not easy oh here it is and then push it up and reveals the front as you can see not the biggest but when you reveal it like like so it's not that bad jumping in you can have your charging cables you can see a reference to my hand like it's not bad I think it has around 50 liters of space you have the manual there but it's actually Jaguar you have the fluids there and other things that I don't know what it is and you just come here pick it up like so and you have to actually put it with a lot of force listen to this yep that's it that's the front of the Jaguar EV again like I told you these headlights are pretty cool I think they are they are Matrix but I'm not sure this car has a lot of Base things because it was cheap he says it's not like the base model but it doesn't have much much extras but again the the they are LEDs so I don't think they are that bad and we have the windscreen wipers the view of the front this car is very very aggressive and the air like I told you goes upwards and behind that that of course roof this roof is panoramic so you can look at it and it looks pretty cool from the air and of course it's like when you are at night or when you are driving you can book up and see all the stars all the things above you as for the charging I think this is the worst part of this car again this car only charges at 11 kilowatts with the non-fast charger so the AC charger this one right here and they have the DC charger which only charges at 100 kilowatts so zero to eight eighty percent I think in about 45 minutes and zero to 100 in about one hour not the best part about the jaguar i-pace in my opinion but let's not complain about this I think this is the worst part in the most delayed part that maybe needs an upgrade from Jaguar but I think it's quite enough if you don't do any type of DC charging if you only do AC charging this will charge overnight no problem whatsoever then again this car has these handles which are pretty cool because you can open them like so and they work like normally but if you close it and you close the car take a look at these handles which will close automatically pretty pretty cool in my opinion and they all do it at the same time you open them they push out you close them they push in very very useful and also improves aerodynamically so very important to have those on this car again these wheels are I think 20 inch wheels I'm not sure but you can see they have these Goodyear tires they look pretty cool they have the Jaguar symbol there brakes these are steel brakes then this car has regen braking and you can turn on only one pedal driving works very well in my opinion one of the best features of EVS are one pedal driving again it says relatively braking and it works and it charges a lot your battery it's actually very strong when you can actually change the settings you can put it very strong very mild or mild this car again is very strong when you put at its maximum setting very cool in my opinion love them again let's now talk about the boots which has about 557 liters which okay this car is close sorry again it's huge I have tons of stuff here in my jacket drones backpack again 500 and 57 liters again I think you don't have anything to complain about the practicality of this soup you have this 12 volt socket here if you want to change your charger appliances again you have this fourth floor here which I can try to open and you have I think a spare tire or something like that more storage there you can put your charging cables have these straps here to trap something if you need to and you can fold down the seats this is hatchback again so I can see the this can close down and to close this very easy you just click it and again it closes this car very very practical like I was telling you so let's get now into inside and see how much space you have in the back let's enter the back of this car and see how much space we have I'm again five seven two five eight and you can see that I have tons of Lightroom this is my driving position so in terms of my leg room it's a lot and in terms of have room let's see how much it is like here's the panoramic room that I was talking about and again let's see how much space do I have in my head so as you can see I'm seated here and this is how much space do I have between my head and the ceiling the ceiling is glass so gives you extra space very cool and I think in the back the only problem that I have the whole issue that I have it's one and it's very simple because the battery is on around the floor of this car your feet are a little bit elevated upwards other than that works well in my opinion very comfortable car to ride on the back but what Mars is in the front let's get into the front shall we let's not leave the back of the car go into the front which is most important part sorry for the noise a lot of motorcycles here what jackasses they are they are making noises because I'm making a video sorry about that nothing I can do we are in the front of this car and as you can see this place everywhere you have the driver's display and you have this display driver's display is very important because Tesla Model y Tesla Model 3 don't have driver's display and this this is a very good driver display this is the main display though where all the fun happens and this is the third display where you can have your AC with these dials I will turn on the car for you to see if this plays on and again these have these displays this shows you the speed zero to 240 again this car is limited to 220 kilometers per hour you have your actual range right now I have about 75 percent with 220 kilometers and then you have the power the regen the kilometers you can change all these menus they are customizable you can put the maps there there's tons of space you have all of these buttons in the steering to change the volume of the car you can see there I I probably cannot see I think you can see you change the volume of the the music here this is to set and change the speed of the limiter and of course cruise control accept calls make calls your driver's assistance and the menu button or the special button for you to change some things here you can change your driving so you know we are in park you can put it in drive you can put it in reverse or neutral in here you change your driving bike you go into sport you go into Eco I don't know you can just click here as you can see there it will change now we are in Comfort I can put it on sport or dynamic and I can put it a comfort again and and Eco I don't drive in Eco I drive most of my time in Comfort most comfortable setting for this inspection for the AC and the driving range is more than enough again this display is all the fun where it happens you have carplay right now it's not connected because I'm filming this video I cannot have it connected you have wireless carplay wired carplay and you have Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections this system though is actually very good very responsive and it's touch just like so very easy all those menu settings are here and very easy to use you have this dial so very common very normal for people that like to change sound and improve those things you also have the AC the AC dials work very well because you can push them up and change all these settings like one two three the levels of the intensity of the fan and you can push it down for example let me turn it off now it's off and if you turn this like is the fan again push it up again oh sorry you can you have to press it and now you're going to the temperature so you push it up you go into the fence you can change the fan speed of the AC I want to turn it off I don't need it and then I push it down and I give it the temperature now we have the temperature and I can set it wherever I want to it's taking a while I don't know why I think it's because it's off you have to turn it on now you can change the temperature like 20 20.5 21 this is of course Celsius you can change yours to Fahrenheit if you want to I don't like to use AC right now it's getting dark outside don't need it we are in the golden hour right now I think it's the perfect time to film this video like I told you these are the driver settings and I also have tons of space here I have my mic charging there this is huge like you can put my hand down there you can see it's big you also have these two cup holders this place where you put your sunglasses your keys you also have this space here for you to put things up then you have the glove box here very manual all of these are manual none no display settings those like these like Tesla thank God then you close these up you have this premium materials like right here these are soft you can see that they are soft and now you also have this piano black that gets very smudged up I'm always cleaning it then on top of here all the materials also very premium and every single thing feels very good even the steering wheel looks very good good and feels very good like I told you this is the jaguar loves to drive this is such a fun car to have and he also the Sun System you have this Meridian South system and it's good it's not perfect but it's not bad overall so what do you tell me if we go into a drive and talk about the driving performance of his car shall we so we are now driving this car and what I can tell about this car is about the performance this car has about 400 horsepower and can do 0-100 or 0 to 60 miles per hour in about 4.6 4.5 seconds on a good day this is a four wheel drive car so has tons of traction and is very very fast I think that driving a Jaguar is all about performance and when you talk about performance you always consider consider that an EV has tons of braking power or horsepower it can launch very fast but around corners because of its weight the way that the battery works it's actually very heavy and it's not that very good to drive it might be I've driven Teslas they are cool but okay they have a good gravity strong pull because like they have they are very heavy but when you start driving them like you feel like again sorry for the I have to put the seat belt on if they will this will not shut up but again driving this car is something that you will not regret after like the 10th the five or first five seconds because it's extremely fun to drive on very tight Corners it's very grippy the car feels like it's a performance car the suspension is tough yes it is it's tough I cannot tell you that it's not it's like an EV that is heavy as a Turf suspension and when you grip it around corners it's just close and when you push this pedal especially on performance mode is very very fast what can I tell you this is a good car to drive very comfortable I think that after a while you will notice they're driving a car it's all about One comfort then performance and then then it comes practicality I think that if the car is not comfortable to drive you will not even drive it and an EV especially good at it it's very silent you cannot hear any road noise can you hear a very small whining from the motors if I push the car a little bit like can you hear it I don't know if you can but it's audible if you were in the car with me then again this car is just so much fun to drive around corners it's a Jaguar you will feel like this car is connected to the road and because of the heavy weight on the battery we'll feel that you have tons of traction and varies very good safety but of course you can go into off-road right now like I'm going right now in Whole Food so like I was telling you this car can off-road and very very well again this is a four wheel drive car and it's a car that can go through mud water has tons of features to do so again this is a Jaguar which is on partnership with vanro Land Rover and Range Rover so you can turn on modes to to actually go off-road this is a very cool car to do so like I told you and I think it's a very completely although it's from 2017 does not feel like a 2017 car does not drive like a 2017 car it's fast it's very reliable the range is very accurate I can get 400 kilometers 450 kilometers out of this car very easily and again that's something that is not usual these days EVS normally have very poor range they give you like oh you can do 500 kilometers but then ends up doing like I don't know 450 400 kilometers and this car no tells you I can do 450 kilometers or even 400 kilometers what does it do 400 kilometers and that's one of the most things that I appreciate on the car is when it tells you the truth the brain tells the truth and this card drives like a Jaguar which has not lost his soul so if you are worried about this car not driving so well again this is a Jaguar don't be worried about that again this car drives like a dream very very very very very fast again it's an EV and I think in my opinion I prefer this car a lot to a Tesla driving doesn't modelize is faster yes even the model 3 is faster but they are not better drivers than this one so if you like Jaguars like the Jaguar EV go for it into i23 at least for driving I think again take one last big look at this car and this design is insane I love it so so much it has so many features that I enjoy from the door handles the wheels the way that is shaped from the back to the front and of course the mirrors all the technology the 400 horsepower 0 to 60 in about 4.6 seconds what's not to like about this car but of course the final question on today's video is should you buy it in 2023 for 70 000 when you have the Tesla Model Y when you have the Kia ev6 so many things that can actually influence your decision but I need to tell you if you like to drive fast cars very very well very well performing cars when driving around like a very very focused performance vehicle then the Jaguar i-pace to see you but let me know in the comments below what you think do you like the Jaguar Pace or not so this has been it this has been my review of the jaguar i-pace in 2033 I totally recommend this car you have 400 horsepower 450 kilometers of range around 270 miles of range you have tons of space very practical a very very focused performance vehicle very comfortable the suspension is a little bit tough but it's a Jaguar what can you expect and of course there's the plus that the interior is very very premium filling so what I recommend you buying a jaguar i-pace in 2023 well I gotta tell you this car has been in my hands for about one year and it's a very special experience when you first get in Jaguar it's very premium very very fast very very focused in performance but does not let go of all of the things that you actually love like the Comfort like the practicality of having a very cool Booth no you have all of that on top of the performance the horsepower and the range the only thing that I don't like about this car again is the way that it charges charges only at 100 kilowatts at fast charging so if you are doing very big road trips more than like 300 kilometers you're almost screwed because you cannot charge very fast and you will spend tons of time on the fast charging but again you cannot have everything if you want just a car to run around town to ride around back at 300 kilometer range then the Jaguar i-pace so you if you want a better range DV there are other options like the Kia ev6 the Tesla Model y but I don't think they are as cool as a Jaguar i-pace very premium very focused on perform months after all is a jaguar or not then of course if you like this video don't forget to drop back down below and subscribe the channel and tell me on the comments which is your favorite TV and have you ever driven an EV car if not then go test drive one I think you'll fall in line with one but of course this has been Texoma talking show here follow my social networks Instagram Twitter bye
