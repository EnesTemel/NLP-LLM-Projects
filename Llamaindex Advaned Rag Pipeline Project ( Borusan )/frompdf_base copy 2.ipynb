 :  2023 Mini Countryman  \\nReview :   \\ncar enthusiasts we\\'ve all had our fair share of positive and negative experiences with car enthusiasts \\nthat\\'s the thing with owners they\\'re always passionate about what they drive and and sometimes it can \\nbecome a little bit toxic however there is one grou p of people who I\\'ve always had a positive experience \\nwith and that is mini enthusiasts because whether you\\'ve got a 500 pound mini one that you bought off \\nof marketplace or a top of the range mini gp3 every mini is welcome in the community and they \\ncelebr ate the diversity of both their members and their cars and that is why I\\'m so excited to have \\nanother mini on the channel my mini videos always do really well because I think you guys can feel how \\nmuch I really love this brand yes they have their flaws and  I will talk about that but overall I can\\'t help \\nbut fall in love with all the cars that I drive the mini Countryman was launched in 2010 and it was a way \\nto keep owners in minis when they outgrew their small three -door hatchbacks and they needed \\nsomething  with a bit more space they create the mini Countryman that meant that all of these owners \\ncould stay in their beloved minis but they\\'re now much more practical for families alike throughout the \\nyears there\\'s also been a ton of special editions some of my favorites include there was the Goodwood \\nEdition a collaboration between Minnie and the Rolls -Royce design team red white and blue models for \\nthe 2012 London Olympics and a pat Moss Edition to celebrate the legendary female rally driver \\nhowever Minnie\\'s la test edition is this one this is the mini Countryman Untamed Edition and in today\\'s \\nvideo I\\'m going to tell you what makes the Untamed so special but also just My overall feel on the mini \\ncountrymen in its latest third generation so if that sounds good the n please do keep watching and guys \\nif you do like reviews like this please please please go ahead and hit the Subscribe button things slowed \\ndown a little bit I feel like I\\'m not pushing you guys hard enough but please if you are watching this go \\nahead and  hit the Subscribe button okay so first let\\'s talk about the exterior details that you get with the \\nUntamed Edition the Untamed Edition is a trim line which is dedicated to the mini Countryman and it \\naligns with everything the Countryman stands for The Clu e is in the name country this vehicle is \\nsupposed to give you a sense of adventure that you can tackle all terrain however the mini Countryman \\nhas never actually been a very good off -roader in fact it was one of the first glorified SUVs it almost \\nstarted t he trend and let\\'s face it most people who buy mini countrymans don\\'t need them to go across \\nmuddy Fields you go for something with a full all -wheel drive system however the Untamed edition of \\nthis car does get the addition of minis all four system which m akes it a little bit better at tackling all \\nterrain I\\'ll talk about that when I I drive it but first of all design you get this really nice Bluey gray \\npaintwork or you can also have it finished in white both colors look really nice with the contrasting \\nelements and that includes a contrasting black gloss Grill black badges black light surrounds Wing \\nmirrors and also door handles and roof you also get some limited edition 18 inch alloy wheels which \\nhave been designed for this car I will say that if you are s omeone who has a lot of fights with curbs these \\nare a pretty busy design so they might get expensive when it comes to repairing them you also get some \\ndecals which just finish off the look of the mini Countryman Untamed Edition and if you look around the \\ncar you\\'ve got some badging you\\'ve got a little plaque on the front here which is actually 3D printed and \\nyou\\'ve got some badges in the rear quarter and on the back my only problem with these Untamed \\nbadges is they just look a little bit like aftermarket st ickers that you get from car shows I don\\'t know if \\nthat\\'s a good thing or a bad thing but for some people that may not be to their taste however it\\'d be \\nvery easy to remove those small decals now where this car gets really really special is inside the inte rior \\nis really very special and it\\'s what\\'s made me fall in love with this car so much you get some very very \\nnice high quality leather seats and they\\'re those classic Mini seats with loads of intricate details they\\'re \\nfinished in a very nice dark green le ather and then you\\'ve got the contrasting Fabric in the middle and \\nyou\\'ve also got some piping finished in light blue this piping around the seats also matches with some of \\nthe plastic around the dash and I love the design of the dash it\\'s finished in a mo untainous design so \\n\\nyou\\'ve got that stacked layering of different Grays it\\'s just very pretty and this in fact also lights up at \\nnight so it looks really good whether it\\'s the daytime or the night time you\\'ve also got that mountainous \\ndesign in little pins which are on the si des of the seats it feels very high quality and very special you\\'ve \\ngot a nice leather wrapped armrest which actually features some wireless charging it\\'s got all the \\nwonderful details which are so iconic to mini and it includes these heavy weighted almost  fighter jet \\nbuttons you\\'ve got that fantastic glowing start stop button which I love so much and then you\\'ve got \\nyour physical climate control dials which just always feel really good quality and they make using them \\nwhen driving easy and that\\'s a good th ing because one thing which isn\\'t so easy to use when driving is \\nthe touchscreen this trim level can be specified on a few different engines so you\\'ve got the entry level \\nCooper which has around 140 brake horsepower you\\'ve got the sportier Cooper S which I \\'ve got today \\nwhich gets around 170 brake horsepower and feels much more nippy underfoot [Music] I always forget \\nhow much I enjoy driving minis obviously I\\'m spoiled for choice and I get to drive some really cool cars \\nand I kind of forget how good these th ings are and I think yeah Minnie\\'s all right I like Minis there\\'s a \\nvery big track to come in about to let him have his moment but I really do forget how fun these cars are \\nto drive and I\\'m not kidding you for the first time in a long time including things  like the Mustang \\nconvertible this is a car that I\\'m gonna really miss because it just feels like the ultimate daily for me \\npersonally I know that SUVs aren\\'t everybody\\'s taste but I\\'ve always quite liked an SUV loved my \\nVolkswagen T -Rox and actually I fee l a bit bad for not convincing my mum to go and drive one of these \\nbefore she opted for the t -rock because yeah I really like this you have that combination of the space \\nyou sit up higher you\\'ve got the all four system which I\\'ll speak about in a moment so  that\\'s going to get \\nyou out of some sticky situations but you\\'ve got all the sportiness of the best minis so this has the \\nCooper S engine and that means it\\'s got 192 brake horsepower which is a lot really isn\\'t it I mean yes it\\'s \\nnot like a performance SU V like something like the t -rock r or the Audi sq2 but it does feel super sporty \\nyou\\'ve got a great noise which comes from the exhaust the steering is really really well weighted and I \\nhave to say the highlight of this car for me is this automatic gearbox I don\\'t know if it\\'s because I\\'ve just \\ncome off of the back of having the Mustang convertible and the 10 -speed Ford automatic terrible it was \\nso laggy it was kind of you could feel it changing this is so very smooth when you\\'re in sport it changes \\nat the r ight times when you want it to change it gives you that really good noise from the exhaust but it \\nchanges up when you want it to doesn\\'t leave it hanging like some other cars and then when you\\'re in \\nEco it\\'s so smooth you barely feel the changes at all it\\' s just a very very good box and I guess maybe I\\'d \\nforgotten that after all BMW and mini do create very good automatic gearboxes and I do have to keep \\nremembering that as much as I\\'m falling in love with this car it is expensive it is one of the most \\nexpens ive when you compare engines and specs to some of its competitors but I think if you love a mini \\nit\\'s worth splashing out on what I want to know is did the person who had the idea of Union Jack rear \\ntail lights get a pay rise because these are some of my f avorite modifications to the new generations of \\nminis they really Elevate the car and they just give it such a strong brand presence I really really like \\nthem if you go for the Cooper S version of the mini Countryman Untamed you also get a pair of twin tai l \\npipes which is always nice and they sound pretty good as well which I\\'ll show you in a moment now \\ninside the boot you get a decent amount of luggage base and the boot in general is just very practical \\nit\\'s a nice and wide opening and this boot floor is q uite low as well so whether you\\'re loading in items \\nyou\\'re getting dogs in the back or you\\'re putting push chairs in the back it\\'s really easy to load all of your \\nluggage I do think we\\'re quite spoiled nowadays when it comes to rear interior space in elect ric cars \\nbecause you forget when you\\'re in a petrol car you need to have a transmission tunnel and that \\ninstantly makes leg room for the middle seat passenger a little bit more tricky to navigate although \\nspace in the back here is not too bad I think even on Long Journeys people who weren\\'t too tall would \\nbe nice and comfortable the quality is all still spot on back here as well I am obsessed with this leather \\ninterior it\\'s so pretty I love the contrasting green and the light blue you\\'ve also got electric w indows and \\ntwo USB slots the mini Countryman itself sits at the higher end of the SUVs on sale today with prices for \\nthe Cooper classic starting from a little under thirty thousand pounds or the cheapest Untamed starts \\nfrom around 4 000 pound more however the lovely details like the two -tone Wheels the Highland Green \\nLeather is all included and options like Sat Nav keyless entry carplay sensors and heated seats are all \\nstandard but that does put it in direct competition with premium Rivals like the BMW X1 A udi Q3 and \\n\\nAlfa Romeo tonale not that any of those cars has the kind of personality of the Mini so I mentioned at \\nthe beginning that the mini Countryman is fitted with the all four system and that it wasn\\'t a real off -\\nroad four -wheel drive system and I guess that\\'s a  little bit mean that\\'s not giving credit to mini because \\nit is a good system but what I mean by that is though it does have the ability to move all four wheels it \\ndoesn\\'t do it all the time it\\'s always kind of focused on that front -wheel drive but also th ere\\'s no modes \\nlike rocks because essentially with the body kit on this thing it has got good ground clearance but it\\'s not \\ngreat ground clearance so it\\'s not set up like an off -roader is anybody surprised no not really but in \\nterms of how the all all four  system works is when it senses that the car is beginning [Music] my God \\nwe\\'ve had tractors we\\'ve had ambulances everything today when the car senses that some of the \\nwheels are starting to slip so if the front wheels are starting to slip it will send up t o 70 of the power to \\nthe rear wheels to unstick you and it\\'ll also kind of just balance out between the front and rear axle the \\npower delivery so it gives you the best possible chance of tackling things like ice and snow of course I \\nhaven\\'t been able to ha ve a chance to actually tell how this works but you can tell that by the way it \\nsticks around corners the way that it handles then it will be pretty robust but of course you can\\'t go \\ncomparing it to something like a Land Rover Defender despite what the nam e might suggest and the \\naddition of all four the mini Countryman Untamed isn\\'t exactly an off -roader but then again anyone that \\nknows their minis knows that these cars were not really designed for that they\\'re designed for \\nAdventures perhaps more adventure s in a city and it\\'s really good at doing that I\\'ve had a fantastic time \\nwith the mini Countryman untamed and I think that interior is really really very special it\\'s made me fall \\nin love with this car I think I\\'ve said that three times now but it\\'s true t he interior really does make you \\nfeel like it\\'s worth spending that extra money over some of its Rivals which are a little bit more boring \\non the inside but let me know what do you think in the mini Countryman Untamed Edition should they \\nhave made this be able to scale rocks and go over mountains yeah it\\'s really not necessary is it but if you \\nthink it is let me know in the comments down below if you\\'ve enjoyed this video as ever please go \\nahead and give it a big thumbs up and if you want to see more videos  like this then please do go ahead \\nand hit the Subscribe button until next time bye [Music] thank you [Music]  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 Mini Countryman  \\n \\nReview :   \\nthe fun to drive spirit of suvs are now here many of wesley chapel has given us the 2023 mini cooper s \\ncountrymen in your midnight black 2 signature trim all new design was last year this year it\\'s going to \\nadd a untamed edition which that package will add  gray metallic paint with piano black exterior \\nhighlights on the s and the hybrid trim inside the funda drive suv receives updated tech sports seats the \\nlarger cooper goes against rivals like your mazda cx -30 your volvo xc40 even the honda hrv that\\'s been \\nredesigned but is this one going to be more athletic a fun to drive kind of like a go -kart or a rally car i\\'m \\nanthony from hawkeye rides and i\\'m going to go over all the specs and details starting out [Music] the \\nnew mini cooper s countryman is bigger the front\\'s going to stress a clean look with less parts added the \\niconic grille it\\'s bigger than before thicker start to a thinner exterior giving a motion appearance as it \\nstays still and it gives us an insert for the chrome and it flows into your led headla mps corner lights and \\nyour fog lamps that are led on the lower trim the air inlets for the brakes highlighted in black is going to \\nsurround the front wheel well with 18 inch pair spoke wheels the famous side scuttle led turn lights the \\nside skirts are goin g to receive the silver that\\'s going to flare out the rears cleaned up as much as \\npossible focusing on the lower bumper part with the gloss black in your dual exhaust outlets making the \\nexit look more simple and plain with the new led union jack tail light s and the iconic chrome that \\nsurrounds the whole vehicle to keep the iconic mini styling it\\'s not going to be the longest the widest \\ntallest it\\'s going to be less than the volvo xc40 they\\'re going to set it up with a strut front suspension a \\nmulti -link rea r both the front and the rear will have a coil spring disc reading behind the front at 13 \\ninches the rear is at 11 both ventilated appearing this to the rivals this has the iconic styling in a heritage \\n\\nhistory whereas you don\\'t have the same in the cx -30 the hrv or even the xc40 a linked at 168.5 inches \\nwith a wheelbase at 105.1 inches we do have the roof racks which gives us more capabilities to do some \\nfun playful things clean and simple and that\\'s wha t we\\'re looking for we also have the best in class for \\ncargo so going inside at 17.5 cubic feet you\\'re going to get some storage compartments on the side \\nyou\\'ll have your 12 volt charger you have a storage tray underneath the bottom the rear bench split \\nfolds to a 40 20 40 split maxing the cargo to 47.9 cubic feet towing over 3 300 pounds a payload over \\n800 pounds the current weight to this is just a hair over 3 500 pounds so when you have that small of a \\nvehicle and you have this much capacity to actually do things it\\'s something nice with the reverse \\ncamera reverse parking sensors this is a twin power turbo vehicle let\\'s go inside start it up so we can \\nhear that exhaust now [Music] the throaty exhaust note that you get out of this little engine is insane \\nbecause again you have to consider the rivals are going to be heavier they\\'re going to be longer this is \\nstill a big vehicle for many however it\\'s not as big as the rivals they back the performance of the 2.0 liter \\nmini twin power turbo four cylinder produc ing 189 horsepower and 207 pound feet of torque that\\'s \\npaired to a seven speed steptronic dual clutch automatic transmission achieving 24 to 33 mpgs let\\'s go \\nfor a 0 to 60 around 6.8 seconds which is quicker than the honda hrv and the mazda cx -30 the base \\nengine trim quarter mile at 15.2 seconds which is faster than mazda and honda and the top speed is \\nfaster than all of them 135 miles per hour that\\'s insane for something that weighs just a touch over 3 \\n500 pounds you have technology styling i mean this is definitely a fun adventure vehicle and it more or \\nless drives like a rally car and yet it\\'s an suv let me know in the comments what you think about the \\n2023 mini cooper s countrymen as we go into the interior go over the tech and take this for our test run  \\nentering inside the mini cooper s countrymen you\\'re going to receive 40.2 inches of head 41.4 inches of \\nleg carbon black leatherette seating they\\'re heated manual adjustment for the front seats which i get it \\nwe\\'re trying to save weight there\\'s sports fro nt seats so i do like that the dashboard simple modern you \\ngot the gloss black for all of your air vents and surrounding the lower lip new decor elements to keep a \\nflat surface mini reduces the amount of switches and buttons to the center display with a ne w look and \\nfeel in the infotainment 8.8 touchscreen with navigation we have the pinch we have the swipe this has \\napple carplay am fm hd radio xm streaming bluetooth audio standard is a six speaker we have the \\nupgraded harman kardon click into the app so yo u can see everything we have we do have amazon \\nalexa to click into your driving mode you will start off with the green your mid and then you got your \\nsports mode which is going to be for your dynamic and you can configure this which is really cool \\nbecause when you click on the drivetrain or chassis you\\'ll see a little go -kart or a rocket the same thing \\nis going to be for the chassis not on the drivetrain so i do like the playful attributes they put switch to \\nreverse you have full trajectory it doesn\\'t cover  the full screen but you have your sensors on the left side \\nso it does make it relatively easy for your reversing dual climate control settings you\\'ll also see that \\naround the gauge cluster when you turn to heat or cold you\\'ll see it turn red or blue when you\\'re \\ncoming close to an object it will also turn red so i like all this funness that they\\'re throwing inside \\nbecause you don\\'t get that with the mazda you don\\'t get that with the volvo and you don\\'t get it at all \\nwith honda as well the focal point though  for a mini cooper is the steering wheel focused on a modern \\nflat black high gloss multi -button structure and this is a leather wrap sports design three spoke dynamic \\ndigital cluster that is attached to it and you can go through an array of information mor e or less on the \\nbottom as you\\'re seeing me toggle it through otherwise changing your driving mode will change the \\ncolor in the center cluster elbows are going to be more firm to ride open up in here and you\\'re going to \\nhave some storage this also folds ba ck and you got more storage you can also adjust this to make it \\nbetter for someone like me because i\\'m six foot three i like that we have the rally toggles underneath \\nthe dual climate control settings because it gives us that heritage you got a 12 volt usb  you have a \\nstorage tray cup holders 16.9 ounce fits without any issues the 20 ounce is probably going to be close to \\nmax the gear lever i do like that with the leather that\\'s around it it\\'s going to be more of a matte black \\naround it with the eyedropped m ouse it\\'s non -touch however you can roll it if you need to i mean this is \\na touch screen infotainment and it has voice recognition why do you need it it\\'s just for somebody that \\nwants to play around door panels are going to have more harder materials on th e top but this is a mini \\ncooper harman kardon upgraded sound system you\\'re going to get that gloss black that\\'s going to \\nsurround it one touch up and down for all your windows and the storage pocket is the largest you can fit \\n\\na lot of 16.9 ounce water bottles comparing it to the rivals more storage in this and the way it\\'s \\ndesigned headroom is the best in class dual moon roof let\\'s see how look in the back for the back seats \\n38 inches of head 34.3 inches of leg i can fit pretty  decent you do sit up more and you\\'re kind of more \\ninside there isn\\'t anything here unless you find this little switch fold it down and see what i mean and \\nnow you have a harder substance but at least you have an arm rest i would probably leave it up thoug h \\nand when you put it up this is actually the seat dimensions so we have them already folded back almost \\nall the way these are all the way so you get the dimensions you have your two air vents in the center \\ngloss black around it two usbc ports storage behi nd both of the front seats non -flat floor but this is a \\nsmaller suv and you can still fit a lot of space and what they do is they put it on the door panel harder \\nmaterials on the top i like that you receive the gloss black in the back and you get the speak er trim it\\'s \\ngoing to be harder surfaces one touch up and down and the storage pocket is huge just like the front \\nmaybe five 16.9 ounce water bottles comparing it to the rivals this actually has more storage than volvo \\nxc40 let\\'s see how look in the center  sitting into the center headroom is not necessarily an issue \\nlegroom i\\'m kind of grazing the back of the front seats in the position that i\\'d be sitting i\\'m going to be \\nsharing significant space for feet but shoulder space however if i\\'m comparing it to t he mazda cx -30 this \\nis going to be better and more optimal in the center the honda hrv was refreshed 10 inches longer than \\nit was in the prior generation so you can actually fit in the center and the volvo xc40 is not necessarily \\ntoo bad either because the y\\'re both box structured suvs but this one because of the 60 40 60 split i \\nactually feel like i\\'m fitting more in the center than i do in the rivals but the fun to drive spirit you \\nactually feel it back here because the way the windows are structured and b ecause you really know that \\nyou\\'re in a mini even in the back seat so they do an excellent job just keeping you in that trim level \\nwhereas when you get to the other brands you\\'re looking for more of a luxury or some upgrades mini \\njust keeps it simple and s mooth let\\'s see how that drive is taking the 2023 mini cooper s countryman \\nnow for our test run 2.0 liter mini twin power turbo with a little less than 200 horsepower i mean you\\'re \\nat 189 horsepower 207 pound -feet of torque the seven -speed steptronic dual clutch transmission is \\nreally where it\\'s at because that\\'s going to make it a lot more aggressive the weight to this just around 3 \\n500 pounds for the curb weight so it\\'s a light vehicle as you\\'re driving it it\\'s gonna feel a little bit more \\nsport tuned as well especially with that dual clutch transmission being in there you will notice it right \\naway and what i do like about it is it keeps that heritage of the go -kart and that\\'s exactly what you\\'re \\nlooking for with this vehicle when you\\'re comparing it to th e rivals you don\\'t really have that fun spirit \\nyou just have turbo that\\'s all they stress this stress is more of a fun to drive vehicle we\\'re going to set it \\nup straight we\\'re going to put it in manual so we can see how it is stop in the middle of the road  here we \\ngo it\\'s going to get loud inside and comparing it to the rivals it probably will be the loudest but the fun \\nto drive spirit you\\'re not going to get too much of that until you go into the mazda cx -30 turbo engine \\nand that one has a lot more power b ut then the price also escalates to more as well red light green light \\nturn radius check at a stop point it\\'s gonna get about two and a half lane here we go it\\'s just fun in \\nnature it is a lot louder you don\\'t feel like you\\'re riding on the ground so i do feel like i\\'m lifted up pretty \\ndecent the shifting on the transmission is good i like the paddle shifters i do wish that they were not \\nsuch plastic but i understand because we\\'re around 37 000 price points you\\'re not really going to expect \\nit to be like fu lly luxury or see some aluminum here and there and brakes it\\'s not bad either you have \\ngood visibility too because you do sit up enough the a -pillars are pushed back because it\\'s more of an \\noval structure to the front wind screen and looking at the back wi ndows you can actually see all the way \\nback if you need to otherwise use your blind spot monitoring now there is three things i like three things \\nthat i dislike is anything more than that i\\'d be taking this mini cooper home the three things that i like is \\nyou still have the same driving dynamics and when i say you still have that bmw took it over you know \\nso you\\'re not expecting to get all of the iconic styling and yet that drive of mini you\\'re expecting it to be \\nmore grown up and they keep the same attribu tes of many which is hard to keep when you are \\nchanging all the dynamics of the vehicle to make it more improved to bmw standards the second thing \\nthat i like about the vehicle is how much space you have cargo is insane when you compare to any of \\nthe rival s even if they\\'re longer you still have more cargo capacity more storage in the door panels or \\npockets it\\'s just great that they give you all of this in a daily use vehicle plus just give it a little gas and it\\'s \\nfun to drive liven it up and look i mean co rnering abilities you can do a light maneuverability with the \\n\\nvehicle it\\'s not going to be full -blown sports car spec but that\\'s the fun thing about a mini footer and \\nsport here we go it\\'s definitely a fun car the last thing that i like is how they pay attention to detail when \\nyou\\'re in this price point typically a v ehicle doesn\\'t put that much emphasis on looking at details and \\nwhat they do with many on the interior and on the exterior just putting all these different simple \\ntouches and yet making it still blend to the iconic mini styling that is something that sets it apart from \\nthe rivals the second thing that i dislike about the vehicle is the air that circulates inside it you have to \\nput this thing on medium to high all the time if you leave it sitting out in the sun it takes a long time to \\ncool off the vehicle in  a hot area and then take back to the mazda 3 hatchback it has the same problem \\nthe last thing that i dislike about the vehicle is a two part it\\'s the tailgate and the back seats the reason \\nfor both of them is you have to have the key fob in your pocket in  order to open the tailgate unless you \\npop it here then you got maybe five ten seconds to open it real quick then you have to almost slam it to \\nclose it the back seats you have to go outside go inside to the rear and pull the lever down it\\'s a lot more \\nwork than the rivals and i wish they would have cleaned that up just a little bit because this is the suv of \\nmini and it just makes it a little bit less quickness in the sense of if i need to throw something in really \\nquick i gotta open the tailgate oh i forg ot my key i gotta go inside get the key open the tailgate go open \\nthe back seats it\\'s just more work what i do like about the countryman is that we have an alternative for \\nthe mini you can get a mini cooper s and it\\'s going to be more sporty you get a conv ertible or a hard top \\nand then you can get the countryman and you got the suv so you have all capabilities to get yourself in \\nthe mini line when you go into mazda convertibles the only one that you\\'re going to get is the mx -5 \\nwhen you go into honda i mean it\\'s not going to be as playful as the mini when you go into volvo it\\'s \\ngoing to be more grown up in luxury so this actually fits itself in a different class category in my personal \\nopinion and i like it because of the fact that it\\'s unique and yet you hav e the dynamics you have the fun \\nto drive you have the sportness even in the interior you\\'re not going to really receive any of that until \\nyou start going into a 40 plus thousand dollar price point and mini backs it underneath that level i like to \\nthank man y of wesley chapel for giving us this 2023 mini cooper s countryman for our car review if \\nyou\\'re already a subscriber thank you for being part of the hawkeye community if not click the next \\nvideo the subscribe button check out the details the merchandise t he website and everything we do \\nhere at hawkeye and to show you for maneuverability the best part is this is not a top -heavy vehicle so \\nyou can have some actual funness with it and when you do it you can see how it stays planted on the \\nroad this is an suv they did dynamics for that and look if i need to do a quick wrap around you can do so \\nthe fun to drive go -kart vehicle is still here  \\n \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 Mini Countryman  \\nReview : hey everyone how\\'s it going thanks so much for tuning in today we\\'re going to be taking an in -\\ndepth look at the 2023 Mini Cooper S countrymen this particular mini actually belongs to my wife so big \\nthanks to her for letting me borrow it for a while we both  love Minnie\\'s I\\'ve had a few myself over the \\nyears but it\\'s been a long time I mean it\\'s been years since I\\'ve had a mini featured on the channel so \\nI\\'ve been really looking forward to bringing this video to you guys it\\'s gonna be a lot of fun as with all  of \\nmy reviews I\\'m going to cover all of the ins and outs and take this thing on a thorough drive I\\'ll also get a \\nbunch of sound clips there\\'s a whole lot of stuff to cover so without further Ado let\\'s go ahead and start \\nher up and let her run [Applause] t hank you foreign [Music] the mini Countryman is currently in its \\nsecond generation which launched for the 2017 model year it competes in the premium compact \\ncrossover segment and as many as most popular offering the Countryman has a unique place amongst \\nits competitors with an expressive retrofuturistic design impressive driving Dynamics and loads of \\npersonalization and premium amenities the Countryman was most recently refreshed for the 2021 \\nmodel year in the few model years since changes have been minimal  and largely pertained to \\nequipment changes colors and special editions this generation is a bit larger than its predecessor so \\nthere\\'s more passenger and cargo room but proportionally I think the dimensional changes dramatically \\n\\nimproved overall Aesthetics this generation also saw the introduction of a new range of powertrains \\nplus further refinements to the optional all four all -wheel drive system despite being the Brand\\'s largest \\nvehicle offering the countrymen is still instantl y recognizable as a mini it features design elements that \\nare typical of the brand including a clear three -way structure when looking at it from the side as well as \\nshort overhangs large wheel arches and a downward increase in width precise Contours across  the \\nsurfaces create an attractive play of light and shade that underscores the athletic shaping in the upright \\nstature of the body this generation also goes further in terms of the countryman\\'s versatility agility and \\npremium character redesigned front an d rear bumpers lend more refined appearance than in years \\nprior the redesigned radiator Grille features hexagonal Contours that are typical of many and it\\'s \\nsurrounded by a slim lined one -piece Chrome frame the grills air intake is subdivided by three hori zontal \\nstruts on the Cooper on the Cooper S The Grille has a bold hexagonal Grille pattern with a red s and a \\nsingle Chrome strut the redesign of the front fascia also added standard LED headlights the distinctive \\nasymmetrically rounded Contours of the hea dlights are accentuated by continuous band of light that \\ntakes on the function of both daytime driving lights and turn signals turning light included in the \\nfunctional range of the headlights provide clear illumination of the side areas of the road when tu rning \\nor changing lanes LED fog lamps are also standard featuring a light band in the upper semi -circle of each \\nfog lamp that serves as a parking light the rear fascia also enhances the more powerful and \\ncontemporary look of the countrymen with redesigned bumper trim all rear lighting functions feature \\nLED technology as standard while the graphic structure of the taillights reflect the pattern of the Union \\nJack paying homage to Mini\\'s Origins as a distinctively British brand the piano black exterior option \\nwhich is now available on all countrymans finishes the headlamp surrounds rear lights radiator Grille \\nand side indicator scuttles and high gloss black instead of chrome along with the door handles and the \\nmodel lettering on the luggage compartment lid addi tional identification features in high gloss black are \\navailable from the range of original Mini accessories 2024 models now starting to roll out the \\nCountryman is available in four models the thirty two thousand six hundred fifty dollar Cooper the thirty \\ntwo thousand nine hundred dollar Cooper S the 42 700 Cooper SE all four plug -in hybrid and the forty \\nthree thousand eight hundred dollar John Cooper Works all four the all four all -wheel drive system is \\nalso offered on the Cooper and Cooper S which would o therwise come standard with front wheel drive \\non the Cooper S all -wheel drive is a two thousand one hundred dollar option each model has sub trim \\nlevels to choose from as well for example the Cooper S can be had in either classic signature or iconic \\ntrams the latter two are an additional two thousand six hundred dollars and six thousand nine hundred \\ndollars respectively over the classic tram with each trim level comes additional standard features more \\nluxurious amenities and more ways to personalize this ex ample is an iconic trim finished in sage green \\nmetallic and accented by a white roof white mirror caps and white Hood stripes the iconic trim is \\noffered with a choice between nine body colors the roof and mirror caps can also be had body colored \\nbut you ca n also opt for white black or silver if you wanted some extra contrast this example is a 2023 \\nmodel front -wheel drive Cooper S Countryman which started at 35 500. the iconic trim was an \\nadditional 4 625 dollars additional options shown here include black a ll-weather floor mats an all -\\nweather trunk mat and a mini first aid kit the total MSRP including an 850 destination charge was forty \\none thousand two hundred fifty five dollars the hood stripes and roof rails were dealer added \\naccessories Cooper countryman s are fitted as standard with 17 -inch alloy wheels while the Cooper S is \\nfitted with 18 inch wheels with the iconic Trim in particular there are four wheel options to choose from \\nincluding two 19 -inch options these 19 -inch turnstile spoke two -tone wheels a re a no -cost option the \\ntires fitted to this example are Pirelli p0225 45 summer performance run flat tires out on the road the \\nCountryman exhibits excellent overall manners with a taunt but not overly firm ride as well as sharp \\nhandling and a connected fe el all season tires are standard when opting for all -wheel drive all \\ncountrymans are offered with a temporary spare tire as a standalone option if equipped you also get a \\nJack and wrench when it comes to stopping power standard four -wheel disc brakes with abs and \\n\\nelectronic brake Force distribution help bring the vehicle to a stop from 60 miles an hour and about 121 \\nfeet the pedal feel is satisfyingly firm and the brakes are quick to respond the front discs are internally \\nventilated and measure 13 inches in diamete r while the rear discs are solid and Measure 11 inches in \\ndiameter all of the discs are clamped down by single piston calipers the suspension combines the tried \\nand tested principle of a single joint spring strut axle at the front and a multi -link rear des ign with a \\ndesign that\\'s optimized for weight and rigidity as well as a model specific setup this lays the foundation \\nfor precise handling properties and maximum agility the best part is that despite being the big mini the \\ncountrymen still delivers the Dyn amics you\\'d expect from the brand it has excellent body control even \\nwith sharp turns of the steering wheel for even higher cornering thresholds I\\'d recommend springing for \\nthe optional Dynamic damper control system which at five hundred dollars includes t wo programmed \\nmaps to alter the damping characteristics of the shock absorbers in response to driving conditions and \\nRoad quality the latest version of Mini\\'s optional all four all -wheel drive system not only reacts quickly \\nand precisely to changing situat ions but it\\'s also Compact and offers a high level of internal efficiency it \\nconsists of a power takeoff unit integrated in the front axle differential a propeller shaft leading to the \\nrear axle and a hang on clutch that ensures precisely measured transmis sion of the drive torque to the \\nrear wheels the system\\'s electronic control is interconnected with the dynamic stability control system \\nso it detects any need to adapt power distribution early on in this way all four optimizes both traction \\nand stability a nd adverse weather and Road surface conditions as well as ensuring improved agility \\nwhen taking bins and more spirited driving the model specific electric power steering system makes the \\ncountrymen exceptionally precise servotronic speed sensitive power st eering is standard which varies \\nthe level of assistance based on your speed of travel this makes low speed maneuvering easier and \\nincreases stability at higher speeds the steering ratio is 14 to 1 and it takes about 2.4 turns from Lock to \\nlock the Turning circle is 37.4 feet the steering wheel itself comes leather wrapped on all country \\nmounts it\\'s a thick steering wheel with pronounced bolsters at 10 and 2 and can controls on the upper \\nspokes to operate cruise control media and hands -free phone systems the  steering wheels available \\nheated and is manually adjustable for tilt and reach the five inch digital instrument display is also \\nstandard on all countrymens it combines the speedometer tachometer fuel readout and the driver\\'s \\ninformation system the latter is accessed by a small button labeled BC on the turn signal stalk as you\\'ll \\nsee in just a bit the colors on the screen change in response to what drive mode you have the car set to \\nacross the model lineup the Countryman is offered with four engine and tran smission combinations the \\nCooper is powered by a one and a half liter turbocharged three -cylinder that develops 134 horsepower \\nand 162 pound -feet of torque Cooper S is powered by a 2 -liter turbocharged four -cylinder that develops \\n189 horsepower and 206 pou nd-feet of torque you can consider these as the core engines of the \\ncountrymen lineup front wheel drive both of these engines are paired to a 7 -speed steptronic and dual \\nclutch transmission opting for all -wheel drive gets you an 8 -speed automatic the Count ryman is \\ncurrently not offered with the option of a manual transmission for a serious jump in performance you\\'ll \\nwant to consider the John Cooper Works which has a higher output version of the 2 -liter engine that \\ndevelops 301 horsepower and 331 pound -feet of torque it\\'s only offered with all -wheel drive and the 8 -\\nspeed transmission on the more efficient end of the spectrum the Countryman se\\'s plug -in hybrid \\nsystem consists of the turbocharged three -cylinder engine and e -drive electric motor and a high volta ge \\nbattery pack the combined output is 221 horsepower and 284 pound -feet of torque and up to 25 miles \\nof all electric range transmission for the SE is a six -speed automatic the SE is also fitted with a hybrid \\nspecific all -wheel drive system as standard it basically works by allowing the engine to power the front \\nwheels while the electric motor acts on the rear wheels with front -wheel drive the Cooper S \\nCountryman is able to accelerate to 60 miles an hour and about 7.2 seconds top speed is 137 miles per \\nhour  the single Twin scroll turbocharger allows for pretty quick response especially when switched to \\nsport mode all of Mini\\'s engines are constructed using aluminum for the block and head the latter of \\nwhich integrates the exhaust manifold for more effective cooling of the exhaust gases in the \\n\\nturbocharging system at the same time crankcase cooling can be reduced when demand is low under \\npartial load by means of a new split cooling system for the block fuel was delivered via high pressure \\ndirect injection there\\'s double overhead camshafts with f our valves per cylinder and variable valve time \\nthe compression ratio is 10.2 to 1. the 7 -speed DCT was introduced as the standard transmission for \\nfront -wheel drive models back in 2020. again a manual transmission is currently not offered there are \\nhoweve r panel shifters on the steering wheel if you want to manually change gears you can change \\ngears using the electronic shift lever as well but if you simply tip it to the left while in drive and don\\'t \\nshift it yourself it puts the transmission into a sport mode which holds gears longer and delivers more \\nemotive shifts compared to a conventional automatic which has a torque converter the DCT features \\ntwo clutches one handling the even gears the other handling odd gears plus reverse while driving the \\nclutches interact with each other when the car shifts which causes one of the clutches to ready the next \\ngear before the car needs it in order to smooth out shifts and improve driving Dynamics the dct\\'s \\nelectronic control module has been programmed to analyze the d river\\'s habits to optimize its shifts if \\nequipped with navigation the data is also taken into account to improve the gearbox shift strategy on all \\ndriving situations allowing it to downshift before you take a corner or take advantage of engine braking \\nwhen  you slow down a crawl function is also included to ensure smooth operation during traffic and low \\nspeed driving gear spacing is also broader compared to the previously used six -speed automatic so that \\nthe engine speeds are more varied for improved fuel ec onomy the Dual clutch gearbox has been \\noptimized to work with an engine auto start stop system in green and mid modes the transmission also \\nhas a coast function that decouples the drivetrain when you let off the accelerator allowing the car to \\nroll at idle  without any engine braking effects coasting function also takes advantage of the navigation \\nsystem and the camera for certain active safety features and can automatically disable itself to utilize \\nengine braking when taking turns or approaching an interse ction the toggle switch at the base of the \\ncenter stack allows you to select between three modes mid Sport and green mid is the default setting \\nthe drive modes Ultra accelerator pedal response and steering effort the operating mode of electrically \\npowered comfort features and the engine sound as well as shift characteristics of the transmission \\nwhen it comes to fuel economy a front -wheel drive Countryman is rated between 24 miles per gallon in \\nthe city and 33 miles per gallon on the highway averaging around  28 miles per gallon premium fuel with \\nan octane rating of at least 91 is required the total tank capacity is 16.1 gallons foreign [Music] \\n[Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] the interior of the Countryman offers excellent overall passenger \\nspace and ver satility for its size both the driver and front passenger benefit from additional Head and \\nShoulder space compared to the previous generation while the adjustment range of the seats have also \\nbeen increased the horizontal cockpit is reminiscent of the clas sic Mini hardtop on the expanded upon \\nwith stretch lines and generously sized surfaces in addition to the use of high quality materials and \\nhaving excellent fit and finish overall the modern ergonomically optimized controls contribute to the \\ncar\\'s premium ambiance I\\'m also a big fan of the little toggle switches they use in the center stack and \\noverhead console one of my favorite things about mini is the level of personalization you have \\ndepending on the trim level you have different options available to ch oose between but all in all there\\'s \\nfive different upholstery options available on the Cooper S including carbon black leatherette a \\ncombination of cloth and leatherette cross punch leather premium Lounge leather and Chesterfield \\nleather the Chesterfield l eather as shown here is distinguished by Diamond stitching across the middle \\nof the seats with color accent stitching and piping the Chesterfield leather also offers additional colors \\nsuch as malt Brown indigo blue and satellite Gray piano black interior t rim is standard while illuminated \\npiano black or eliminated shaded silver is available with the signature and iconic trams this example has \\nthe standard headliner which is similar in color to the satellite gray leather a black or anthracite \\nheadliner is al so available power adjustable front seats are available on certain trims and include power \\nadjustable lumbar support and a memory function on the driver\\'s side heated front seats are standard \\nalong with heated mirrors and washer Jets a heated steering whee l is available as a standalone option \\n\\nthe narrow pillars and high seating position make for excellent outward visibility when it comes to \\ninstruments the early countrymans were set up similar to other minis at the time with the speedometer \\nin the center of the dash and the tachometer and infor mation system on the steering column the newer \\ngeneration minis have since moved on to a more modern setup of having all of the instruments on the \\nsteering column with the circular control unit now incorporating a standard 8.8 inch touchscreen \\ninfotainment  system two audio systems are available including a standard six -speaker system with AM \\nFM tuners HD radio and Sirius XM Satellite Radio a 360 watt 12 speaker Harman Kardon Hi -Fi system is \\nalso available the MINI Connected controller in the center console includes a rotary dial and shortcut \\nbuttons for various infotainment features that can help make navigating the system a bit easier the \\ntouch screen itself is very responsive with the most recent refresh the circular control unit gained a \\nmore refined appe arance with the audio control panel the buttons for the hazard lights and Driver \\nassistance systems now integrated more seamlessly with high gloss piano black touch surfaces \\nnavigation is added with the signature tram along with Advanced real -time traffic data and auto \\ndimming rear view mirror and power folding side view mirrors MINI Connected includes a wide range of \\nMINI Connected Digital Services and can even be used to send navigation directions from your \\nsmartphone to the countrymen the vehicle is alwa ys online enabling seamless integration of available \\nAmazon Alexa voice assistant on the iconic tram this also provides access to real -time traffic information \\nand internet platform and smartphone integration with Wireless Apple carplay this circular contr ol unit \\nis also available with an interactive and customizable LED ring that provides illumination and response \\nto driving situations by way of control feedback when equipped it also comes with an expansive LED \\ninterior ambient lighting system and a projec tion of the mini logo from the exterior mirror on the \\ndriver\\'s side when opening and closing the door a single zone climate control system is standard on the \\nCooper while a dual zone system is standard on the Cooper S regardless of the system equipped ther e\\'s \\nthree easy to use rotary dials and buttons in the center stack the Countryman offers a lot of storage for \\na smaller vehicle helping optimize functionality in addition to Door pockets and bottle holders there\\'s a \\nfully fledged center console extending u p to the instrument panel that offers a covered storage \\ncompartment that doubles as an adjustable armrest two cup holders in front of the transmission lever \\nand a couple of additional trays in the center console with USB A and C outlets now to mention a 12  volt \\npower outlet wireless phone charging is included with the iconic tram the charger is located inside the \\narmrest however due to the small space it would have to be a smaller phone for example an iPhone \\nMax will not fit even without a case the Countrym an is equipped with a SIM card that\\'s permanently \\ninstalled this enables the use of intelligent emergency call with automatic detection of vehicle location \\nand accident severity as well as many teleservices the standard rear view camera and rear Park dista nce \\ncontrol can be expanded by opt -in for the iconic tram which includes front parking sensors and a \\nparking assistant feature for easy parallel parking optional mini driving assistant includes Collision \\nwarning with City braking function camera based adap tive cruise control pedestrian warning with initial \\nbrake function high beam assist and road sign detection active cruise control is also available as a \\nstandalone option with intelligent engine and braking control adaptive cruise control helps maintain a \\nconsistent speed an onboard camera even helps maintain a consistent distance between you and the \\ncar ahead a pretty neat head up display is included on the iconic tram IT projects a multi -color image \\nonto a retractable tinted screen versus projecting an im age onto the windshield I actually prefer this \\nlayout it\\'s very helpful it keeps the image just below your line of vision and allows you to monitor \\npreferred travel information mini navigation system directional arrows infotainment functions check \\nControl Data and more without unnecessary distraction mini also offers an alarm system as a \\nstandalone option to provide additional protection for the doors the trunk lid and the hood on top of \\nthat an ultrasonic sensor provides interior protection as far as airba gs there\\'s eight in total including \\nside curtain and front knee airbags the current generation Countryman is 7.8 inches longer than its \\npredecessor and approximately one inch wider the wheelbase is longer by 2.9 inches the rear door \\n\\nopenings are also larger improving the ease of Ingress and egress this growth resulted in significantly \\nincreased interior space especially when it came to rear seat leg room the countrymen can see up to \\nfive people without too much difficulty the biggest hinderance for taller folks will be the middle portion \\nof the seat due to the height of the center floor tunnel an array of child seat anchors enable a car seat \\nto be placed in either of the three seating positions the Dual pane sunroof opens at the front and is \\nfixed in the rear each portion has a mesh shade that can be pulled back to filter the light while still \\nallowing some to pass through to maintain a sense of openness for the interior the Countryman is also \\navailable without the sunroof if you prefer  the base of the rear seats can slide four and aft longitudinally \\nby up to 5 inches the backrest also reclines so you can kick back and relax on a long trip one downside is \\nthat there\\'s no Center armrest to fold down there are however three full -size adjus table headrests that \\ncan also be folded for extra visibility when not in use I\\'m five foot ten inches and felt there was plenty of \\nspace overall the added adjustability definitely gives more flexibility for taller folks but all in all the \\nCountryman offers  great accommodations for this segment additional rear seat amenities include \\nadjustable air vents in the rear of the center console two USBC charging ports large door storage \\nPockets front seat back storage Pockets overhead LED illumination and overhead g rab handles with coat \\nhooks rear privacy glasses available as a standalone option a power opening and closing tailgate is \\navailable as an option the tailgate is light and easy enough to open manually but it could prove to be a \\nuseful convenience if your ar ms are full behind the rear seat you have 17.6 cubic feet of cargo space the \\nrear seat backrest is comprised of three sections that can not only be reclined like you saw a second ago \\nbut they can also be folded flat to accommodate many different combinatio ns of passengers and cargo \\nthe 40 20 40 design allows you to fold down each section independently for example if you have thin \\nlong items like skis you can fold the middle section down and still have space for two rear passengers if \\nyou remove the Privacy cover and fold the rear seat completely flat you can expand the total carcass \\nbased 47.6 cubic feet that\\'s an increase of 5.4 cubic feet when compared to the previous generation \\ncountrymen the standard storage package includes an adjustable height cargo ar ea floor cargo Hooks \\nand tension straps not to mention a stainless steel insert on the loading sill for a nice touch one unique \\noption is the picnic bench which is an upholstered padded cushion that folds out of the luggage \\ncompartment that provides seatin g atop the rear bumper for two people while the vehicle is parked \\nadditional trunk amenities include LED lighting on either side and a 12 volt power outlet on the right \\nside well everyone that\\'s going to wrap it up for this video I hope you all enjoyed the  in-depth look at \\nthe Mini Cooper S countrymen be sure to stay tuned next time and

shabby at all this in my best dug demero \\nimpression I\\'m just kidding this is the 2023 Mini Cooper Countryman in Nanook White and it is really \\nsharp I was hesitant to like this color because pepper whi te has been a Mainstay in the mini Community \\nbut to see this color in person this new Nanook white it is very very sharp definitely more of a metallic \\ncolor definitely more metallic Fleck in there but it really does look good and on this new Mini \\nCountryman it is very very sharp with the black accents on it it just looks really cool this one kind of \\nreminds me of a panda bear but that\\'s a given with the coloring really sharp looking now this is a \\nsignature trim 2.0 and it\\'s nicely equipped all four all-wheel drive black pin spoke wheels 2 liter 189 \\nhorsepower engine it has nice interior this one\\'s really cool it has a white exterior with a white interior \\nso that\\'s kind of cool really really nice with the leather interior in here touch screen of cours e this has \\n\\nnavigation so can\\'t go wrong there love that and it has Apple carplay so another great feature to have \\nreally really nice overall the interior finishes are just great very comfortable very kind of cool looking I \\nwasn\\'t sure I would like the white on white in this case it actually works and it looks incredibly good now \\nof course because it\\'s signature trim it does not have a power liftgate but that\\'s not a deal breaker here \\nthis is still easy to get access to easy to open and close not a heavy tailgate by an y means and in the the \\ntrunk area you have plenty of cargo space you have a load floor that can be lifted up to get a little bit \\ndeeper cargo area and if you fold the seats flat you have more cargo space there in the back you have \\nplenty of space for your passengers I\\'m only five nine so if the driver\\'s about five nine six foot I\\'m \\nactually not bad here I got plenty of space here between my knee and the back of the seats and there\\'s \\nalso extra stuff down here there\\'s USBC ports there\\'s a rear vent the front  passengers get adjustable \\nlumbar which I wish I had in my car but I don\\'t and did I also mention that if you want to sit a little bit \\ncloser to the seat in front of you you can actually reach down here and pull this lever and Slide the seat \\nforward so tha t\\'s a neat feature and it\\'s on the other seat too so both of them have that this is a 60 40 \\nsplit bench as well enough room back here for two passengers comfortably three in a pinch and up front \\nwhere the magic happens you have these nice comfortable seats  with adjustable thigh rests very very \\nnice setup and heated steering wheel so that\\'s an added bonus Digital dash when you start the car up \\nvery very nice setup here the new steering wheel is really cool I love these buttons and everything fun \\nfact this bu tton here Lim actually limits your top speed so if you hit about 60 miles per hour and you hit \\nthat button you cannot go any higher than 60 miles per hour so neat little trick there so if you \\ninadvertently press this button while you\\'re driving don\\'t worry  there\\'s nothing wrong with the car you \\njust limited your top speed is all now I\\'m not exactly sure what is going on there but it says this vehicle\\'s \\nmileage on this tank of gas is 527 miles which I don\\'t think is possible now of course as I mentioned \\nearlier we got the nice touch screen navigation Apple carplay if you have it equipped all the different \\nsettings and functions are in here all the different things you can do with the event led on the bezel you \\ncan even change it to just be a solid color very very nice climate controls are easy to use and of course \\nwe have all of our toggle switches down here including the driving mode sport Eco and mid traction \\ncontrol we can turn off the engine stop start so if you don\\'t want it on you can turn it off and the n of \\ncourse the toggle switch to start and stop the car and for stereo we do have Harman Kardon in this \\nvehicle so we got the speakers in the car as well as the very nice Subs underneath the seats and in case \\nyou want a little bit of sun we do have a sunro of in here Panorama of course and to reduce the glare \\ninside the vehicle it has an anthracite headliner which I am all for because I\\'m not a fan of the beige \\nheadliner or the gray headliner it just doesn\\'t look as good to me and I know I just said all four  so mini \\npun and I did touch briefly on the exterior trim we have piano black trim pieces all around the vehicle \\nthe side scuttles the headlight Rings The Grille the badges even the tail light rings they\\'re all done in this \\nbeautiful piano black which real ly sets off the features of this vehicle against the Nanook white so really \\nreally nice look even Countryman lettering in black as well and this car also has the black tailpipes which \\nare pretty sharp looking and at thirty nine thousand dollars this is not  a bad vehicle that is pretty decent \\nmoney for what you\\'re getting which is quite a lot of car and it\\'s very fun to drive everyone thinks that \\n189 horsepower isn\\'t enough for these all four countrymens but I disagree they\\'re small they\\'re \\nmaneuverable they \\'re all -wheel drive that horsepower is plenty and the torque is where it\\'s at 207 foot \\npounds of torque this thing gets up and goes very quickly now I will say the only thing this vehicle is \\nmissing is some Bonnet Stripes I\\'m thinking a nice set of sport s tripes in Black going right down the \\nmiddle here would really set this car off so what are my overall thoughts on new color since this is the \\nfirst time I\\'ve seen it since Minnie announced it I really like it and I can see why they got rid of white \\nsilver it would have really kind of matched this color now am I disappointed they got rid of pepper white \\nabsolutely pepper white was a staple of mini ownership almost everyone you\\'ve ever talked to has \\nowned a pepper white mini so to see the pepper white color d isappear just kind of sad I think this is a \\npretty sharp new color out here and I think it\\'s one that\\'ll sell very well now as for me I\\'m gonna go take \\n\\nthis car and park it back where it needs to be parked but if you like what you see check out more \\ncontent on this channel at the end of this video and as always thank you so much for watching okay  \\n  \\nCar Model : 2023 Mini Countryman  \\nReview : [Music] don\\'t you feel like breaking free open your eyes and Embrace what you see now don\\'t \\nyou feel like [Music] today we have a 2023 mini Countryman for those of you who are unfamiliar with \\nMini\\'s lineup the Countryman is a Sub -Compact SUV and as of now the only crossover offered by the \\nBritish manufacturer the 2023 model year marks a debut of a limited Untamed Edition that you see here \\nwhich includes this momentum gray metallic paint all four style exterior trim unique wheels and piano \\nblack exte rior details now the Countryman has four powertrain options a 134 horsepower 1.5 liter turbo \\n3 cylinder 189 horsepower 2 -liter turbo inline 4 21 horsepower plug -in hybrid offering up to 18 miles of \\nelectric range and a top of a line 301 horsepower 2 -liter Turbo 4. the car is built on BMW\\'s UK L2 \\nplatform shared with cars like an X1 X2 or a 2 Series Gran Coupe so we\\'re off to a good start the chassis \\nfeatures McPherson struts in the front and multi -link setup in the back combined with optional adaptive \\ndampe rs now before we talk how it all works together let\\'s jump inside the Countryman and talk about \\nthe Interior Space the interior of the countrymen cannot be mistaken with any other car typically for \\nmany many elements have rounded shape and it feels very re freshing to be in a cabin that doesn\\'t feel \\ngeneric you can tell that the designers put a lot of attention to detail to make the interior feel very \\nspecial and kudos to them for that the quality isn\\'t necessarily top -notch but you do get some premium \\nflare s materials used inside are acceptable at this price point and everything is well put together the \\ntechnology has been basically carried over from BMW the infotainment system is a previous generation \\nof iDrive which means you can control it either via a to uch screen or a controller placed in the center \\nconsole now I\\'m one of the few people who actually have no issues with iDrive and for me it works well \\nthere is a little bit of learning curve but once you get used to it you will find it relatively easy to o perate \\nand a clean graphical interface helps with that Wireless Apple carplay is standard and if you opt for the \\niconic stream you will also get a wireless charger among other features you get a very simple non -\\ncustomizable digital cluster and a head -up di splay the front seats are surprisingly comfortable for a Sub -\\nCompact crossover and if you\\'re a taller individual like me you will appreciate a low sitting position and \\nextensible thigh support now moving to the back it\\'s still a mini so there isn\\'t a ton o f leg room in the \\nsecond row but the Headroom is pretty good and climate vents as well as two USBC ports are always \\nnice to see lastly the trunk it offers 17.6 cubic feet of space and if you fold the back seat down that \\nnumber goes up to 47.6 cubic feet al right so that was the interior of the mini Countryman let\\'s get it on \\nthe road now and see how it drives many have always been associated with a go -kart-like driving \\ncharacteristics so is that the case with the Countryman well not really it\\'s a crossover s o what you get in \\nthe first place is a well -balanced chassis with great damping and reasonable driving Dynamics since the \\nCountryman is an SUV it\\'s not as fun to drive as a smaller Tudor Cooper however the Adaptive dampers \\nwould stiffen up in sport mode he lp with eliminating some body roll and the Countryman retains a little \\nbit of classic Mini character feeling Nimble and being engaging to drive on curvy back roads now the \\nCooper S variant that I tested is powered by BMW\\'s b48 which means it\\'s a 2 -liter tu rbocharged 4 -\\ncylinder making 189 horsepower and 207 pound -feet of torque available at just 1300 RPM it\\'s no secret \\nthat BMW makes one of the best turbo 4S and the one in the Countryman only proves that the tuning is \\nexcellent resulting in smooth power deli very and even though the car isn\\'t crazy fast it feels quicker than \\nthe numbers suggest the all -wheel drive model gets an 8 -speed conventional automatic that again \\ntypically for a BMW product has been tuned well and its logic and automatic mode is great fu el \\neconomy during my week with the Countryman I averaged 22 miles per gallon in the city 33 on Highway \\nand 26 combined now when it comes to driver assist features the Countryman comes standard with a \\n\\nforward Collision warning with automatic braking Lane departure warning traffic sign recognition and \\nrear parking sensors sadly blind spot monitoring and rear cross traffic alert are not available which I \\nthink is a joke especially considering that most ma instream SUVs or crossovers have it as standard so \\nthat was the mini Countryman with everything we covered let\\'s jump to the conclusion the mini \\nCountryman is a fun stylish and a practical subcompact SUV that is shockingly refined in every aspect \\ndespite t he Brand\\'s perception it feels like a legitimate entry -level luxury product that is pricey but if \\nyou\\'re looking for something that will distinguish you from the crowd and has a character that many \\nSUVs don\\'t maybe besides a Bronco sport that\\'s your only o ption pricing starts at 32 650 for a base front \\nwheel drive Cooper and an all -wheel drive is a fifteen hundred dollar option for a three cylinder and \\n2100 for a more powerful Cooper S my fully loaded tester and iconic trim with a special Untamed \\nedition pa ckage was priced at forty five thousand two hundred and fifty dollars it\\'s worth noting that \\nwhen you purchase or release the Countryman you get free maintenance for the first three years or 36 \\n000 miles whichever comes first and the car is covered by a fo ur-year fifty thousand mile bumper to \\nbumper warranty if you have any questions about the Countryman feel free to drop a comment and I\\'ll \\ndo my best to answer them thanks so much for watching and I\\'ll catch you later foreign  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 Mini Countryman  \\nReview : hey guys it\\'s Christy with motoring motivation you know the drill by now is just me my mini \\nmusic and a motivational segments that I play here on the station and you\\'re probably thinking wow did \\nshe not just say Minnie but she\\'s got a Jeep behind her that sort of doesn\\'t fit well that\\'s because for the \\nlast two years my husband and I both have become a two uh many of two Jeep family that\\'s right we \\nboth owned Jeeps I had a 2018 Jeep Rubicon Recon and my husband has this in mod process Jeep Willis \\nand I loved the fact that both of us owned a Jeep I love the fact that we had that freedom and flexibility \\nto take it out on the beach to go up on the trails to take the camper out and just really be kind of out in \\nnature and really enjoying things the thing s that I couldn\\'t do when I owned a mini But ultimately it \\nbecame for me at least a love -hate relationship because my jeep was a daily driver and after owning it \\nfrom 2021 to 23 I just had become a little bit frustrated and annoyed every time that I went u p to the \\nGas Pump and so at the end of 2022 I took all of my receipts for Phil I tallied them up and then I \\naveraged them out and I was spending anywhere from around 450 to 600 dollars a month in fuel and \\nthat really depended on how much I was driving it i n that month where we were going because mainly \\nbecause mine was newer and more luxurious we took mine most of the time but there is a price to play \\nto pay to be able to get out and play so to speak and because uh we liked the fact that we modded all of \\nour minis they were never the same they never stayed the same the Jeep isn\\'t much like that which is \\nwhy I think a lot of mini owners transition to them because it\\'s saying that same quirky feel that you \\nhave and making it morph into your personality and tha t\\'s what I had done with my Rubicon which is \\nnot the one that you see in the background I lifted it I had bigger tires on it I had a heavy front and rear \\nbumper I had a roof rack on it I had a swing arm for the spare tire on the back I had the winch on it and \\nso on and you know what that means wait more weight a lot more weight and so on and that only \\nfurther decreases your fuel consumption for uh for the month it just all adds up so I think uh on the \\nscreen the last time that I checked it I was getting lik e 11 miles a gallon you know what the cost of fuel \\nwith it going up and down it\\'s still very very expensive and at the end of the day I just didn\\'t want to go \\ninto 2021 having that trailing behind me did mean you know so ultimately I made the adult decisio n and \\nthe most logical one um was to let my Jeep go because we still had one that we could go out and have \\nfun in and so I decided to let mine go on to another owner that was going to enjoy it just as much as I \\nhad which put me back to trying to decide wha t do I want to drive I\\'ve been in the mini Community for \\n17 years an ironically between the classics that we\\'ve owned and the different models we\\'ve owned 17 \\n\\nminis to which is the length of the time we\\'ve been in the community crazy but I wasn\\'t sure that I \\nwanted to go back to many I just kind of was ready to break away and try something else and not get \\nkind of Typecast for being known as the chick with all t he modded out Minis so I drove a lot of vehicles \\nwhat I did know was that I wanted a small SUV crossover something that had a little bit of space and \\nflexibility for traveling and carrying things but I didn\\'t want a very big SUV again fuel um so I looked a t \\nthe Porsche Macan GTS in a used model could not get into a new one but they used ones I could get into \\nat my price point I looked at a BMW X1 and X3 I looked at Audi and Land Rover Alfa Romeo and um \\nJaguar all of those as well as some American -made ones and while I was out looking I also looked to the \\nhybrids and I looked at the electric vehicles it would not I wouldn\\'t have done myself Justice if I didn\\'t \\nyou know at least look at those and drive them and try to decide what I wanted to do at the end of a ll of \\nthis which was exhausting I finally realized what I was still oh my gosh we\\'ve got the popo coming by so \\nI\\'ve got a loud noise so wait so ultimately what I knew that I wanted was a vehicle that was very much \\nan extension of my personality which is qu irky and fun that had some fun colors with it and that was \\neasy to sorry I got my hand in a cast it was easy to modify and trick out that I could bring it to life in my \\npersonality It ultimately came down to actually two or three it was the Alfa Romeo the jaguar and the \\nPorsche Macan and the BMW actually four and ultimately at the last minute I narrowed it down to \\nBMW the only thing with the BMW is it still is more refined it was more polished it was more of that \\nprofessional luxury and that\\'s really not me  I\\'m more quirky and fun and odd and so I loved it but I \\nwasn\\'t in love with it so the last ditch effort before the purchase I called my motoring advisor Michael \\nover at flow mini in Raleigh North Carolina said hey thinking about buying a new car what you got um in \\nthe mini lineup I don\\'t know that much about them now because I\\'ve been out of the community for a \\nwhile I do know that I was would be interested in a John Cooper Works any model let me see what you \\ngot fast forward he calls me got this awesome J CW that rolled off the lot I think you would be interested \\nhow about come for a drive well folks that did it right now I am the proud owner of a 2023 John Cooper \\nWorks many countrymen and a beautiful sage green which again is outside of my comfort zone but  I \\nabsolutely think it\\'s beautiful it\\'s uh it\\'s kind of that chameleon color that it actually changes with the \\nway the sunlight comes off of it sometimes it looks that very much uh greenish color sometimes it looks \\na bluish gray sometimes it looks like a a  different kind of gray it just depends on how the light hits the \\nmetallic color but it\\'s very much reflective of my personality and also the fact is I really miss the Need \\nfor Speed and so this can go from zero to four seconds at 301 horsepower and I thin k it\\'s pretty \\nawesome I\\'m actually super enjoying it and it\\'s not burning fuel oh my gosh I still actually can have a \\ntank uh my gas can actually go for almost three weeks that\\'s if I if I drive it on green mode but it\\'s still \\nbetter than my jeep was so yo u know what I haven\\'t had it for just actually just a little bit now but as \\nsoon as it came off the lot it didn\\'t come the way it came you know I can\\'t do vanilla I can\\'t do ordinary I \\nhave to be a little bit off the chain and extraordinary so you see thes e my wonderful husband surprised \\nme and he worked a deal with many behind the scenes that I didn\\'t know about and actually bought \\nthese wheels for me which are the JCW 19 -inch Pro wheels and I think they are fabulous I\\'ve actually \\nbeen wanting them since I  own my 2017 Clubman and I just could never justify the cause for it so that \\nwas kind of like my Valentines kind of every kind of thing present surprise all wrapped up into one and \\nI\\'ve never cried I\\'m not a crier but let me tell you when I saw these on it  when I went to pick it up I cried \\nI think everybody thought they needed to call 9 -1-1 because it was just that much of a surprise that my \\nwonderful husband had done that for me and the Michael and all of them he uh Henry and Kurt all of \\nthem were working this out behind the scenes and it kind of just reminded me of it felt like coming \\nhome to my mini family and I\\'m so happy to be back and I\\'m so happy to be back on the channel and \\nyou know just keep watching because you know this ain\\'t gonna be the same as  it is now I\\'m gonna \\ntweak it I\\'m gonna style it I\\'m gonna flare it I\\'m gonna make it be more like me so I hope that you will \\ntune in because we\\'ll see where this is going and oh by the way her name is Maleficent you know we \\ngotta name the minis all right guys take care  \\n\\n \\nCar Model : 2022 Mini Countryman  \\n \\nReview : hi guys follow me on instagram to never ever miss any of my crazy updates hi guys and \\nwelcome to another vlog i\\'m driving this this is the mini cooper s countryman john cooper works \\ninspired model this is actually the facelift of the countrymen straight aw ay we\\'re going to be opening \\nthe engine bay as easy as that that is engine bit says twin turbo mini there\\'s insulation right there and i \\njust love the way the hood opens that cutting for the lights anyways let\\'s close this right away okay this \\nis heavy bec ause of hydraulic struts but there we go now on the facelifted model they have updated the \\nlights the grille as well as the bumper even the rear bumper and the lights have some amount of tweaks \\nbut this is the jcw inspired model which gets a sportier bumpe r board at the front as well as the rear you \\ncan see s written right here a lot of chrome on this car the fog lights are also quite bright and that is \\nobviously the towing hook of the vehicle you can see a lot of insects have actually hit the number plate \\nany which ways the lights are really very nice these are all led units in fact it says mini on the inside that \\nis the level of attention to detail and there\\'s a chrome surround as well this is a functional air dam \\naerodynamic bits on this car and of course  this gray color looks fantastic but this is not the best looking \\nmini in fact it\\'s not even the worst looking mini because the clubman also exists somewhere in the \\nworld the wheels are actually bigger 18 inches on the jcw inspired model regular model gets  the 17 -\\nincher 225 50 18 is the size of the tires you can see a lot of brake dust here and there says john cooper \\nworks on the cab too and uh you got this body cladding running throughout the car s written right there \\ni think this is for the indicator okay  it actually projects mini on the road at night chrome door handles \\nthere\\'s a request sensor on both the sides which is actually a nice thing and this is in the higher variant \\nyou get a request sensor key let\\'s enter or not this is actually you can see the  indicator here as well \\nwhich is pretty nice okay uh wipers have that dual blade treatment too okay is this a led no this doesn\\'t \\nseem led to me anyways you can see the length of the car it gets this black colored roof so sort of a \\nfloating roof treatment as well coming to the rear obviously you get the union jack in the lights okay the \\nrear lights and it says mini right on the inside as well can you see that i don\\'t know something there \\nthere it is okay and you get two proper exhaust vessel hands fingers o f truth will actually hide in the \\npocket and uh you got sort of for diffuser treatment as well two rear requests no therefore actually on \\nthe side which is kind of camouflage in the body colliding and yeah doing hook says countryman right \\nthere that is a r everse parking camera cooper s written here mini logo of course and you can see the \\nindicator functioning right now this is the rear fog light and uh actually like the car\\'s design from the \\nrear okay let\\'s see the tire right away there it is the tire and t his is the exhaust the rear exhaust of \\ncourse you\\'ve got two of them on this car in this car whatever let\\'s open this power tailgate as well boot \\ncarrying capacity is actually decent enough and below here you get the spare wheel which is obviously \\nnot an a lloy it\\'s a smaller sized wheel which will not dwell into because it\\'s just a one one five ninety five \\nseventeen we\\'re tire sizes to be honest let\\'s shut this okay there is the manual placement there as a well \\ncharging socket as well this opens there\\'s a l ight placement here first aid kit and you can split out the \\nseat but you know there\\'s a gap here i don\\'t know why there\\'s a gap it\\'s kind of weird and awkward and \\nlet\\'s press this button to close the boot okay the warning triangle is right there there it s huts now they \\nhave this chrome line which is continuing throughout the car you can see this okay unfortunately \\nthough it\\'s not so fluid in certain areas there\\'s sort of a panel gap i don\\'t know how that happens oh well \\nthis is called british engineering ex cellence at its very best okay i am mocking and i\\'m taunting but yeah \\nthat\\'s a fact everyone keeps blaming indian cars for bad uh you know fit finish of the panels well the \\nbritish\\'s britishers are no less car is unfortunately locked so that\\'s about it tha t is a walk around of this \\ncar let\\'s start driving right away just kidding okay i have to unlock the car from here and also turn off the \\n\\nindicator which is making some noise all right you can see the dashboard design is actually quite nice \\nand this is actually a practical mini because of the long wheelbase there\\'s good amount of space on \\noffer there\\'s good amount of storage space as well lo ok at the storage bed that\\'s amazing okay quality is \\nnice it gets proper leather as well which the lower model does not get in fact the jcw inspired model \\ngets a lot of features like a bigger screen for the infotainment system and a lot of bits which shoul d \\nactually be standard in the non -jcw model as well you get isofix anchors and then you can recline the \\nseat like this and then it is upright why would it be so upright i have no freaking idea take some effort to \\npush it back into place and there it is com pletely into place now this can be moved ahead or behind but \\nyeah after some effort it has gone behind and of course now you can see the legroom has improved \\ndramatically that is the reason there was this gap in the boot now this is actually the lever to o perate \\nthis can\\'t operate with one hand at all inside there there\\'s good amount of legroom and nerman offer \\nscooped out seat back magazine holder where there\\'s something i don\\'t know anyways two usbc \\ncharging sockets ac vents here as well none here no heig ht adjustable seat belts and you get a hook \\nalong with a handle as well let\\'s shut the door at the moment okay glass area is decent enough because \\nthere\\'s a glass area here as well bringing in a lot of light and seat belt for the center passenger is here o n \\nthe top and the center passenger obviously gets a head because it\\'s a proper adjustable headrest and of \\ncourse there is a center armrest with twin cup holders too meanwhile there is a sun blind here for the \\nsunroof this one does not open there\\'s light pl acement here as well in the center now this obviously \\ndoes not open but they could have given a larger one piece unit but for this light they actually \\ncompromise on that it\\'s kind of surprising under the support though is a bit of an issue and headroom is \\njust about adequate as well so rear seat experience is actually quite nice i like it but there could have \\nbeen some storage here in the center but they\\'ve given massive storage on the door pocket so that\\'s \\nnot something you would really complain about love  the treatment on the seat seats are really very nice \\ndashboard looks fantastic thankfully with the latest generation of the countrymen they\\'ve got rid of \\nplastics but still quite a few of them here and there now this jcw inspired model obviously gets more  kit \\nincluding a harman kardon audio system and uh a lot of other things which should be standard like i\\'ve \\nbeen always mentioning minis have not been well equipped just because of the styling factor now you \\nget electric adjust for both the front seats how ever the driver also gets memory function you can save \\nup to google settings the best thing is under the support is not an issue because you can just press this \\nand open the i mean extend the seat base to improve under the support this is to open the boot of the \\nvehicle there\\'s good amount of storage space at the front chrome controls for the power windows and \\nthis is to lock i mean this is to retract or unretract i don\\'t know if that is a word the outside review \\nmirrors nice because nice chrome treatments lot of clone treatment but hard plastics are there and soft \\nones are there too now it gets these uh pedals which are very nice along with a dead pedal as well since \\njohn cooper works right there again a specific feature of the john cooper works inspired mo del these are \\nthe controls for the headlights of course and you get a headlight leveler this is for front fork this for rear \\nfog let\\'s step inside but look at the seats just so damn awesome really very comfy and below the front \\ncenter armrest there\\'s actua lly a wireless charging pad which is not very easy to use to be honest and \\nhere you can see there is some amount of storage space along with a usb charging socket now this is a \\nusb c charging socket electric parking brake control controls for the i drive s ystem and call the eye drive \\nonly thing is in bmw when you turn like this it goes down how you have to do it ulta i don\\'t know my \\ntool okay the glove box is decent size not really very big but hard plastic slow down that\\'s the ambient \\nlighting the light ac tually is fantastic in this car because this ring changes according to what you\\'re doing \\nso when you\\'re reversing and you\\'re about to hit an obstacle it turns red when you turn on the air \\nconditioning and when you turn this you can see the color is changin g when you\\'re operating the air \\nconditioning that\\'s also pretty awesome depending on where you\\'re taking the temperature so yeah \\nthis is a nice unit this is eight point eight inch meanwhile the lower trim actually gets six point five inch \\nor so switch into  into there\\'s a reverse parking camera which is on at the moment which gets adaptive \\n\\nguidelines as well and rear parking sensors can be seen here it\\'s a touch operated unit obviously very \\nnice very fluid to use and see the quality of the screen it\\'s so good now that even in bright sunlight you \\ncan see everything love the way mini does the controls which are sort of aircraft style there is a secret \\nlighter here a proper usb charging socket right there this is for the stop start system this is to turn on the \\nvehicle traction control and this is for the drive mode this is for air conditioning air conditioning controls \\nare given right there air conditioning actually works flawlessly well auto dimming inside rear view mirror \\nagain the toggle switches for the lights very much like an aircraft and this is to open the sunroof so now \\nhere\\'s the probl em the sunroof is opening but the sun line has to be manually retracted only yeah you \\nhave to manually retract the sunlight but i said once again it opens further hello everybody how are you \\nwhy am i shouting like stupid anyways let\\'s shut this and let\\'s s hut that as well so both should have been \\noperated simultaneously and why it operates like this now there of course is a mirror along with two \\nlights on this side same as the case here as well a mirror along with two lights and there is the mic \\nstructured properly so overall dashboard design is obviously very attractive you get a heads -up display \\nas well which shows you a lot of data in fact uh you know if you are having a bluetooth okay there you \\ncan see audio information also comes on the heads -up display  along with navigation data as well so this \\nis to lock the car this is unlock the car some of these controls a lot of chrome used inside steering feels \\nnice to hold gets the jcw batching so this is the jcw steering wheel plastic paddle shifters these are \\nactually the controls for the multi -information display this for voice command is to pick up a phone and \\nthis is for cruise control i love the red stitching i love how they\\'ve made the steering feels really very \\nnice fantastic attention to detail looks fant abulous without a doubt let\\'s get into reverse i\\'ve already \\nshown you the reverse parking camera but hey we can do that again any which ways now to browse \\nthrough this system it\\'s very easy because it\\'s very fluid and very nice i mean it\\'s very funky as we ll so \\nthis navigation which is inbuilt so you can see that as well let\\'s just get to the map so you can see how \\namazing the display is on this car that is so phenomenal totally love it it\\'s also telling me that i have my \\nmanaged 8.4 kilometers per liter th at\\'s kind of bad that\\'s not something which you should be showing \\nme and making me regret why i opted for a petrol one over a diesel meanwhile these are actually the \\ncontrols for the indicators this bc button is to browse through the lower screen so it\\'s s howing me a lot \\nof information there as well fuel efficiency real -time mileage whatever whatever okay indicator shut \\nyourself now this is a 5.5 inch screen it\\'s a digital one this is for the fuel meter and this is for the \\ntachometer here you get the speedo meter and lot of information on the top like what is the distance to \\nempty what\\'s the temperature like time clock blah blah blah and when you actually turn this on it shows \\nyou the mini logo when you turn it off it again shows you the mini logo it always k eeps reminding you \\nthat you\\'re in a mini why this thing does not do a good enough job of what obviously you get the \\nchrome surround as well now let me do one thing let me turn off the car so when you turn off the car \\nthere the heads -up display actually goe s back inside and when you turn it on obviously the heads -up \\ndisplay comes out let it shut itself there it is and now we turn on the car and there it come on it\\'s so \\nfreaking slow but it\\'s there whenever you need it and then you can see the information i d on\\'t think you \\ncan okay saying mini right there yeah there it is now let\\'s use the wipers right away good amount of \\nspray on offer yeah it\\'s actually a lot of spray on offer change the windscreen in no time at all and also \\ncleans the sunroof as well let\\'s use the rear wipers and there you see the spray is also nice here again \\nvery nice wipers on this guy i really like the vipers on this car very fast very smooth only thing is the \\nwasher fluid is so much a completely cleans the whole car now you can see thes e lights keep changing \\nas per its own mode as such which is pretty nice harman kardon speakers are fantabulous let\\'s listen to \\nan audio right away [Music] audio quality is very very very nice very impressive audio quality what do \\nyou think about the dashbo ard design i think it looks pretty dumb awesome air conditioning works nice \\ngood amount of features as well although it could have got a lot more features like ventilations because \\ni\\'m boiling at the moment i\\'m literally boiling with so much sweat coming o ut because it\\'s like what two \\no\\'clock and we are right in the middle with the sun shining brightly let\\'s do one thing let\\'s start driving \\n\\nright away first things first air conditioning off we get into sport mode we also get into sport mode for \\nthe overall settings of the car we turn on sport displays traction control off press it once it is dynamic \\ntraction control keep it pressed it turns o ff completely that dsc deactivated close this message we have \\nthe sports displays on left foot on the brake right foot on the actuator driving the motor doesn\\'t really \\nlive [Music] but then it gives you quite a bit of wheel spin and off we go so performanc e is actually very \\nvery very nice indeed this is a two liter turbo petrol engine known as the twin power turbo petrol \\nwhatever you want to call it it actually powers a lot of bmw cars and it is fantastic in the way it produces \\nits mid -range performance bec ause lower down it feels a little laggy although there\\'s no turbo lag as \\nsuch but it doesn\\'t have that grunt lower down but the mid range is very surprising around 1800 900 \\nrpm it pushes forward with a lot of enthusiasm and pulls very strongly indeed this gearbox is a seven \\nspeed dual clutch gearbox which is very eager and very fast with shifts only thing is sometimes it doesn\\'t \\ngive you the downshift which you\\'re looking for now this engine produces 192 horsepower and 280 \\nnewton meters of torque the result  is 0 200 kilometers per hour in a claim 7.5 seconds which is actually \\n0.8 seconds slower than the regular mini cooper s with the same engine but it\\'s lighter of course three -\\ndoor this is weighing around 1500 kgs but doesn\\'t feel its weight at all that is the level of agility on offer \\nthis engine super duper refined but becomes very sporty once you push it yeah that sporty sound is not \\ncourtesy of the exhaust unfortunately there\\'s some fake sound which comes in the cabin why are the \\nspeakers yeah that is a bit of a problem however most people don\\'t even recognize it because it\\'s so \\nwell calibrated this thickness as well pulls really nice and strong and there are four drive modes on offer \\nsorry there\\'s three drive modes which alter four parameters of the car so there is green which is \\nobviously for eco mode there is mid which is for normal mode and this sport which is for sport mode \\nnow the four parameters which are being altered is the engine the transmission as well as the steering \\nand the sound of this car okay there\\'s a b class which is going to fly by so the sound also gets altered \\nthere are two settings for the sound actually normal and sport same way the two settings for the \\nsteering wheel which is normal and sport however for the engine there are three settings even for the \\ntransmission which is normal eco and sport so in sport all the four things are in sport in eco two things \\nare in eco which is obviously the engine in the transmission and two things are in normal which is the \\nsteering as well as the s ound and in normal everything is in normal like all the four parameters are in \\nnormal indeed i love the way this car is so pinpoint accurate handling is super duper awesome okay \\nwe\\'re going to get into manual we are in manual mode it will hold on to again it will not up shift unless \\nand until i decide to do so there holding the red line close to 7000 rpm crossing 100 kilometers per hour \\nin third gear itself this is such an engaging and fun car to drive it\\'s absolutely stunning the steering \\nwheel is so pinpo int accurate you can feel exactly where the front wheels are pointing that is the level \\nof precision from the steering wheel body roll what is that there is no body roll here it has amazing body \\ncontrol the suspension is really very stiff that\\'s why ride q uality is very bad in fact it\\'s atrocious to say \\nthe least even on like normal roads like this you can feel the car moving around there is no flex in the \\nchassis but the suspension is like okay it\\'s just not comfortable enough for long journeys even for \\npassengers in the car they are not really comfortable in this vehicle because this car is not about \\ncomfort or practicality although the countryman dredged towards practicality by offering a decent sized \\nboot and space at the rear but hey there is no body ro ll so people would not feel that but people sitting \\ninside the car will definitely feel the stiff suspension and that\\'s the reason i would say if you\\'re buying a \\ncountryman for practicality please don\\'t if you\\'re buying a countryman for performance and fun  please \\ndon\\'t get the mini cooper the regular one the three door even the fighter for that matter but then again \\nin the fight or why would you see more people in the car they\\'re going to feel pukish for sure because of \\nthe stiff suspension the ride is real ly bad at low speeds it kind of gets better as you like speed up so it \\ncomes into its own element here we\\'re going to change this the mode so that you can see the different \\ncolors as well and this is the green green is basically efficiency made is like nor mal performance but in \\nsport mode is where it really gives you all those i mean all the punch it has and it feels really exciting to \\n\\ndrive in sport mode because the performance is really amazing it\\'s like fantabulous in fact top speed is i \\nthink around 230 kilometers per hour but you wouldn\\'t really care to go that fast in this car because you \\nhit one bump and then kind of gets unsettle d because of the stiffness and i\\'m talking about uncertainty \\nbecause of the expansion joint on the expansion like oh my goodness the suspension also can get quite \\nnoisy especially on this jcw inspired version the problem is okay hear this yeah the problem is that \\nthey\\'ve gone one big on the wheel which means the profile has also decreased and you can see the \\nresult for yourself right comfort not it\\'s 40 at all and this jcw inspired has a sportier version of the \\nalready sporty dual clutch gearbox still it\\'s not really fast with downshifts or eagle with downshifts as \\nsuch and braking performance is actually quite nice it stops in its track but i i feel that it requires even \\nstronger brakes considering the mad performance on offer from this mini cooper s countr yman john \\ncooper works inspired to lead a turbo petrol engine car ah stopped okay listen to this okay [Music] yeah \\nthere are modes for the gearbox as well and what are the modes for the gearbox well either you can be \\nin drive or you can mean sport or you c an be in manual and once you touch any of the paddles you \\ntrigger the manual mode and the best thing is it will hold on to again it will not up shift until and unless \\nyou decide to do something talking about expansion joint i was telling you about it and y ou can feel it \\nright now as well handling is just amazing okay just amazing the steering is so pinpoint accurate it is \\nactually on the heavier side at lower speeds but it is so freaking feelsome offers the right feedback \\noffers the right weight and just i mean it glides through corners you can feel exactly where the front \\nwheels are pointing there since there\\'s no body roll either it just feels amazing to drive nothing even \\ncomes close to this car other than other mini cooper motors of course there\\'s no fle x in the chassis just \\njust such an engaging and fun car to drive which reminds me there was also a diesel on offer earlier \\nbefore the pre -face lift i mean in the pre -facelift the problem is that they have discontinued diesel \\ncompletely on many models but t he pressleys or rather the brochure or whatever information about \\nthis car they sent me it had diesel mentioned and it had an sd mention in it i don\\'t know where that \\ndiesel is it\\'s vanished but a diesel obviously doesn\\'t offer the same level of thrill as a petrol engine but \\nhas that torque which it can this one kind of lacks lower down the reverse that\\'s why drivability is not its \\nforte at all it it kind of feels lacking lower down in the rev range and only to greet you with a stupendous \\nmid-range and of c ourse it\\'s a drinker okay it returns somewhere between seven to ten kilometers per \\nliter depending on your driving side obviously you can stretch that a bit by driving safely but if you want \\nto drive same way just get a bmw x1 it uses the same uk l2 platfo rm and this guy competes with the \\nvolvo xc40 as well as the bmw x1 and the mercedes gla and the audi q2 a lot of rivals but by far this is \\nthe best in terms of driving ability now this is obviously a front wheel drive car that\\'s the reason why it \\nspins its  wheels like crazy but still no tendency to understeer boss it is not having any understeer \\nalthough minion also offers all grip abroad that\\'s only going to add to weight and slow down the car but \\nyou know rear wheel drive is for the win but no mini model comes with your b drive either you get front \\nwheel drive or all four this is so much like audi has it light off listen to this it does have a tendency to \\nmake a lot of wheel spin sounds yeah depending on how you launch it it can make even more sounds \\nbut n othing close to the bmw x1 because the diesel engine obviously has a lot more torque as well so \\nthat two variants on offer there is the cooper s and there\\'s the cooper s john cooper works inspired \\nwhich is this one which is priced at rupees 52.5 lakhs four  lakhs cheaper is for the lower variant or the \\nentry -level variant or whatever you want to call it now the thing is all the prices i mentioned obviously \\non mumbai what you get is stupendous amount of equipment for a mini in the john cooper works \\ninspired m odel along with less practicality because of the bigger wheels of course and overall a very fun \\ncar to drive but then i just don\\'t understand why would i buy the countryman because it is not really \\npractical even though it\\'s practical when i can get the sa me levels of fun by being lesser with the \\nmeaning cooper regular model the cooper s three door or the five door or john cooper works or any of \\nthose cars maybe even the convertible for that matter of course this is a different flavor of suv or \\ncrossover fr om mini [Music] now another very cool feature of this car is when you\\'re driving in eco \\n\\nmode which i\\'m going to put the car in right now which is the green mode of course and now you just \\nnotice one thing the way the rpm meter is just observe the rpm meter how it keeps declining putting \\nthe car in the highest gear possible and then at one poi nt what it does is it kind of gets into neutral it \\ndisengages with the gearbox and decouples with it and there you see 1000 rpm that\\'s how it tries to \\nconserve fuel as much as possible and then you get on the throttle and of course it will pick up pace \\nreally fast but not as fast as when we are in sport mode because sport mode feels the most fun to drive \\nfor sure maybe adaptive dampers could have been offered to make the ride more comfortable so \\nusually you say you know they should offer adaptive dampers so  that the handling becomes even better \\nin sport but no no no handling is perfect so no chain needed there what we need is little bit less stiff \\ndampers at lower speeds or especially in comfort mode or in eco mode so you know it\\'s like ulta which i \\nmight ex pecting i want less 40 suspension option as well so guys this is my vlog of the meaning cooper \\ncountryman i think it\\'s fantastic it\\'s really fun to drive it\\'s a different take on doing an suv or a crossover \\nor whatever you want to call it and mini has that  jump but it is quite expensive as well and of course i \\nmiss diesel because yeah i have to fill up fuel right away bye  \\n \\nCar Model : 2022 Mini Countryman  \\nReview : the last term you ever want to use when you\\'re talking about a mini is large but yet you can\\'t \\nhelp but use that term when you\\'re talking about a countryman because well it is the largest of the \\nmodel lineup it\\'s a five -door crossover that is about a mere inch more than 14 feet long about six feet \\nwide and just over five feet tall to be honest with you next to our family car which is montero this thing \\nlooks like a little type it\\'s actually quite cute unfortunately the term large also is used to describe it s \\nprice kind of painful so the question is does this 2022 mini countryman s actually deserve the price it \\ncommands let\\'s find out [Music] [Music] do you need help purchasing your car insurance head on over \\nto autodeal.com dot ph slash car dash insurance he re you can compare prices and customize your \\ninsurance coverage from many of the philippines

and receive your policy within the next business day get the best \\ndeal on insurance without a deal i\\'m not sponsored or anything by carmen\\'s best i only thought about \\nthis skit right now because it\\'s quite warm today but much like  the ice cream i haven\\'t met a mini \\ncooper that i did not absolutely fall in love with and this this blue has got me floored now i did mention \\nthat it is a bit on the pricey side and that\\'s true but it\\'s really not the fault of the car not at all see in th e \\nunited states if you were to get this trim you\\'re going to spend roughly about 38 39 000 so you\\'re \\nlooking at about 2 million philippine pesos but because of all the tariffs that you need to pay when the \\ncar gets here and of course they import taxes say hello to three million seven hundred and fifty \\nthousand fifteen pesos but back to the original question is it worth it at its heart is a twin power turbo \\ntwo liter four -cylinder gasoline engine mounted to a seven -speed dct that produces 192 horses and 280 \\nnewton meters of torque now what all that mumbo jumbo means is that inside the city moderate traffic \\nwill return about 12 kilometers per liter but on the highway this thing is capable of 20 kilometers per \\nliter those figures are roughly the same as a subco mpact sedan that has only a 1.5 liter engine granted \\nthis is also four times the price but think of it this way this can achieve zero to 100 kilometers per hour \\nin just seven and a half seconds it\\'s got a top speed of 226 kilometers per hour and there is n o way a \\nsubcompact sedan sounds like this the 2022 revision introduced a lot of new changes and it essentially \\nmade its predecessor look well kind of old in a day paired with its iron blue color not only is it stunning \\nbut it\\'s still distinctly mini in des ign there\\'s hardly any chrome on here with the painted surfaces instead \\nof old shiny bits that we\\'re kind of used to in the previous iteration it\\'s an all led affair with projectors \\nand fog lamps found down below that have such an awesome throw and then th is brilliant drl that \\n\\nsurrounds the entire headlamp it\\'s so cool it looks like it looks like david bowie with eyeliner maybe not \\nas cool and the only thing though is that i wish that they would have hit the sensors just a little bit \\nbetter i don\\'t mind them they\\'re not botherso me but yeah a little bit more work on that would have \\nbeen nice so you got matching accents down the side roof rails and cladding at the bottom a black roof \\nwith matching mirrors that have repeaters and then 165 millimeters of ground clearance not much for  a \\ncrossover no but the 165 is helped by these large doors and smaller windows to give the appearance of \\na larger automobile then these are some of the biggest wheels i\\'ve also seen on the mini they\\'re two -\\ntone 19s on 45 series tires which to be honest wit h you add such a badass factor to this car and then \\nthese guys are in front of discs up front and discs at the rear some of the most robust brakes that i\\'ve \\never used in my entire life i mean they\\'re so strong it feels like they could stop the rotation of the earth \\nas if its size and shape weren\\'t iconic enough now you can really spot a mini from like miles away thanks \\nto these bright rear leds and the union jack pattern that you will find inside these guys are so bright that \\nif you\\'re stuck in traffic and you\\'re applying the brakes look at your rear view mirror and you\\'ll be like oh \\nmomolo it happened uh also since this is an s there are twin exhausts found down below now when you \\nopen it up with the power tailgate which is actually pretty fast by the way j ack noticed that you are \\nlooking at 450 liters of very usable space because this to know can actually 86. um at 450 liters of space \\nyou\\'re looking at about the category of the same subcompact sedans that i was talking to about talking \\nabout earlier uh and if you haven\\'t seen that review by the way i just shameless plug do click \\nsomewhere on the link because we have a comparable of the m grand the city and also the almera \\nwhich actually was a lot of fun to do if it\\'s the link\\'s not on the screen i\\'m sure it\\' s somewhere down \\nbelow now back to the mini it may have a little bit less space than the subcompact sedans because \\nthose guys were above 450 a little over 500 but when you fold the second row you are looking at a \\nthousand four hundred liters of space now t here\\'s no way a subcompact end has that and then also \\nobviously there\\'s a little bit more space when you remove the false bottom and then there\\'s also this \\ncool and nifty feature that you can stick out so you can hang out at the back of your mini without \\nscratching your car or dirtying your legs that is pretty darn cool i like that i wish all cars had that the rear \\nseats of the countryman s are a pretty large contrast from those uh front because well the bolsterings \\nback here aren\\'t as noticeable or as supp ortive as that in the front seats and quite in fact if you were to \\ngo around the twisties you\\'d actually be kind of sliding around back here which might be actually a lot of \\nfun uh toys back here include air vents found up front two of them i might add and  then two type c \\ncharging points then in the center armrest you\\'ve got two cup holders and then additionally you\\'ve got \\nbottle holders on either door with speakers space is actually pretty decent elbow room for two \\npassengers in the rear not an issue a thi rd passenger not so great because well there\\'s a tunnel and \\nyeah that\\'s gonna eat up a lot of elbow room so two adults actually not an issue uh legroom is actually \\npretty good because you can stretch your legs even underneath the passenger or rather the dr iver\\'s \\nseat because that\\'s well that\\'s my normal driving position so uh leg room is you\\'re looking at maybe \\nabout seven or eight inches that\\'s actually pretty big and then head room at least four inches man that\\'s \\na lot of space back there um it\\'s quite co mfortable and the air is actually pretty good back here as well i \\nhave sat back here while jack drove and the other time my wife drove and i got to tell you the air is \\nactually pretty good too because well since the cabin is not very big and there\\'s a to n o for the cargo \\nspace it cools the cabin off very very quickly and that i think is actually a pretty big plus now if you\\'ve \\nnever sat inside a mini before and partly because you\\'ve always thought that that car is basically for \\ncoco sized people that\\'s wher e you\\'re dead wrong check this out see the mini and its power chairs can \\nadjust so much so that i don\\'t think fitting quite much taller people would ever be an issue inside this \\ncar because not only can you move the chair this far back but you can also mak e it sink and then move \\nthe steering wheel as close to the dashboard as possible look at the amount of space i have i\\'m telling \\nyou right now from my foot to the accelerator it\\'s roughly about seven inches that\\'s seven inches of leg \\nroom and look at the he adroom look at that that\\'s now what is that is that another eight inches that\\'s \\n\\neight inches dude and look at the reach that i have to the steering wheel oh mind you that when you do \\nmove the steering wheel even if you are a taller passenger the instrument cluster actually moves up and \\ndown with you i am not the biggest fan of it simp ly because i just like the analog gauges more but that\\'s \\nactually pretty darn cool so truly i\\'m not saying that shaquille o\\'neal could fit back here no not that but \\nanyone above six feet tall possibly even six two six three even six four wouldn\\'t have an i ssue sitting or \\ndriving inside this car and then watching them getting in and out of it would actually pretty damn damn \\nfunny too on the well -appointed steering wheel you will have buttons for your audio and cruise function \\nwith a braking function it\\'s not  a full -on adaptive feature but it\\'ll be enough to keep you from rear -\\nending someone in front although wheel mounted paddles are available to keep your hands on the \\nwheel and your eyes focused on the roads thanks to a heads -up display which provides speed and select \\nmenu displays you\\'ve got an 8.8 inch touchscreen infotainment system which doubles as your reverse \\ncamera which can be controlled either via the touchscreen or the idrive system using the knob here at \\nthe bottom if you know the idrive system tha t means it\\'s basically a bmw which means it\\'s actually \\npretty darn snappy the good news is is that it has apple carplay and wireless apple carplay at that the \\nbad news is no android automatic air knobs found just above a few function buttons and then just \\nbelow that toggle switches that this century\\'s minis have been known for which include an eco standard \\nand sport driving mode and then some found on the roof one of which changes the ambient light inside \\nthe car which it\\'s no disco but damn that looks pret ty darn good the speakers inside the automobile are \\nharman kardon and they sound pretty great the base at the start needs a little bit of help but you can \\neasily change that in the settings of the automobile which brings me to the three things that i\\'d wan na \\ntweak inside this car or perhaps even change number one is that well there\\'s no android capability not \\neverybody\\'s apple so please include that number two these buttons here i thought they were \\ntouchscreen apparently not they\\'re actually buttons that yo u have to press actually quite hard and \\nnumber three it\\'s very cool that there is a charging pad found here on the center armrest which has a \\nclip unfortunately it can only hold quite small phones like it\\'ll fit jacks but mine is just too big what what \\ndo you mean what did i say something wrong the countryman is well equipped with a total of six airbags \\nabs with ebd parking sensors stability control traction control or reverse camera tire pressure \\nmonitoring and isofix [Music] ride height or not there is li ttle so almost no body roll inside this car even \\nwhen you\\'re taking corners which makes the mini just so fun to drive lane changes are immediate the \\nsteering is so quick that you\\'re in a turn even before you\\'re actually there it\\'s mind -boggling now for \\nthose that know what to expect from a mini that\\'s actually a great thing for those that don\\'t well it\\'s not \\nas if that you\\'re going to be questioning your life choices when you\\'re driving on edza because of the \\nrigidity of the chassis no not a month understan d that it\\'s not rules but the trade -off is is that it\\'s got a \\nvery go -kart feel to it and on paved roads wow this thing is just so planted oh and speaking of rolls -royce \\ni actually had the opportunity of meeting the ceo when he was visiting manila a couple  of years back \\ntorston mueller otvos god i hope i\\'m saying his name right the thing about him is is that when he\\'s not \\nballing in rolls guess what car he\\'s driving i\\'ll give you three guesses but you\\'re only gonna need one the \\nnvh inside this automobile is  actually quite superb you\\'d expect that when you\\'re on the highway it\\'s \\nalmost dead quiet really but inside the city it\\'s actually pretty darn good the most unpaved roads that \\nwe can think of would be like again edsa but even then it\\'s actually pretty dar n quiet and it starts when \\nyou close the door really because the car just feels like it\\'s built solid it\\'s so quiet and yet check this out \\nwhen we open the door you can hear the road and the cars passing by once you close it it\\'s solid and all \\nof a sudden it\\'s just so quiet it\\'s amazing granted the tire noise inside the city on more unbehaved paved \\nroads does creep in yes but i mean you\\'re rolling around on 19 and 45 so it is a bit expected the dct is \\nwell it\\'s kind of uncharacteristic of a dct granted beca use the dct\\'s that we\\'re normally used to is on \\nmuch more affordable vehicles where uh it\\'s trying to get rid of first and second gear as quickly as \\npossible and there\\'s a bit of a jolt here there is none i mean you can floor it on on on eco on sport or on  \\nnormal mode and the transitions are actually pretty smooth and i like it i think the best part about this \\n\\nautomobile is i like the fact that it\\'s so tiny and powerful at the same time that it can bring you to the \\nspeeds of going back to november 12 1955 in less than 10 seconds and at the same time it\\'s got breaks \\nthat can hold you in 2019 forever it\\'s kind of a deep reference but you\\'ll get it [Music] minnie has been \\ngetting a lot of flack and loyalists are right to say that it\\'s not the same car anymore it\\'s it\\'s either too big \\nit\\'s too expensive it\\'s too german and yeah i get all of that but the truth is for a nameplate to survive it\\'s \\ngotta evolve no matter what anybody says but at what cost okay so truth is you can probably get \\nyourself a bmw x1 for much less than you would spend on this countryman well this is essentially the \\nsame as a bmw because it\\'s a bm w underneath but i guarantee you that the x1 won\\'t make you smile \\nfrom ear to ear or as much as this countryman will so is it worth it maybe not to you and me but i\\'ll tell \\nyou one thing that the next time i see this on the road i\\'m gonna be extremely jeal ous of the person \\ndriving that\\'s a fact  \\n \\n \\nCar Model : 2022 Mini Countryman  \\nReview : g\\'day guys matt brandt here let me ask you a question let\\'s say you go out you well you want to \\ngo out you want to buy yourself a mini but you don\\'t want a mini you know you don\\'t want a small car \\nbut you want a mini you know but you don\\'t want a mini but you want a mini what do you do what does \\none do in that situation well that\\'s a great question and that\\'s what i\\'m here to answer you go out and \\nyou buy yourself one of these it\\'s a mini countryman but this isn\\'t just any mini countryman this is th e \\nmini countryman jcw john cooper works which means that yes under the bonnet is a fire breathing four -\\ncylinder it\\'s got a lot of power as we\\'ll get into and you get an all -wheel drive car that\\'s essentially a \\nfamily hauler today we\\'re going to be doing a full in -depth review of the new mini countryman i\\'m going \\nto show you the exterior the interior i\\'m going to launch this thing from zero to 100 kilometers an hour \\nto see if it\\'s really as quick as the manufacturer\\'s claim and of course we\\'re going to give it some source \\naround saucy corner because that\\'s what we do here at matt brown cars and you know what you do you \\nsubscribe so go down there hit the subscribe button hit that notification bell you know what to do all \\nright let\\'s just uh let\\'s get into the review baby don\\'t know what i say sometimes okay let\\'s start with the \\nfront of the mini countryman with what\\'s new so first of all you get a revised bumper up front and the \\nled headlights have been updated they are led now standard across the range and thi s one here is \\nmatrix led so it blanks out part of its beams for oncoming traffic because this is the top spec mini yours \\nthere are some things that i especially love about the front of the mini countryman i love the blacked \\nout badging you have to look the  john cooper works badge up front get this nice chilly red stripe here \\nand they extend across the rest of the car i don\\'t know how i feel about uh the amount of chilli red it\\'s a \\nbit too spicy for my liking get it i really need to reconsider my life choice s but yeah i mean it\\'s a pretty \\ngood looking car from the front especially for an suv and like any good v8 monster you get a a a bonnet \\nhood thing except this is not a this is not a v8 this is a four cylinder it\\'s alright bmw mini are still learning \\nfor th ose who don\\'t know it\\'s made by bmw all right let\\'s check out the sign what the whole the mini \\ncountryman doesn\\'t actually look that big right but once you actually see it from the side that\\'s when \\nyou start to notice that maybe this is an suv not a bad th ing because for an suv it is still quite small on \\nthe outside but on the inside as you\\'ll see it\\'s pretty massive so what do you get out here where you get \\nthese 19 -inch alloy wheels they are wrapped in eagle f1 rubber which is really good and look you get  \\nmassive brakes up front john cooper works branded though i think they\\'re brembos could be wrong but \\nof course you get the quintessential black plastic cladding and more chilly red chili red here here here \\nand on the roof look how massive that chilly red p aint is on the the roof i don\\'t like it i would get it in \\nblack but yeah look you get keyless entry and and go although the keys are inside we can cut that out oh \\nlook you get suv rails up top on this top spec mini yours you also get a double panoramic sun roof up top \\n\\nand we\\'ll come over here and um yeah i really don\\'t know what else to say about this there\\'s not that \\nmuch going on it\\'s pretty cool let\\'s take a look at the back and then there is the rear and biggest change \\nyou\\'re gonna notice are the union jack tail lig hts these are like a more 3d effect than you\\'ll find on other \\nminis and i love them they look especially cool at night you\\'ve got your classic little roof spoiler here for \\nmaximum aerodynamics and then you get more blacked out badging look mini\\'s blacked o ut the \\ncountryman badge is blacked out though it is a really cool look at bold and spaced out then of course \\nyou get fake diffuser down here but this is my favorite part these exhausts they sound amazing take a \\nlisten oh and how could i forget the john coo per works badge back there yay what about boot space i\\'ve \\nhad to over expose myself so you can see inside of here but look you press that it is an automatic \\ntailgate it opens up nice and automatically and you get a decent amount of storage in here it\\'s not  class \\nleading but it\\'s still pretty good look you get a little false floor and you get even more storage under \\nthere that\\'s actually really good you\\'ve got a little storage area here you got your your load cover there \\nit\\'s like a cardboard i\\'ve never felt  that before and of course you can get more space if you you come \\naround here and if you do that and yeah you find a button of some sort ah here it is it\\'s a pulley it comes \\ndown like that you could you could do the same for the other side oh and then we w e have one left up \\noh you get the picture that goes down somehow and yep something so actually storage space within \\nhere is surprisingly good it\\'s much better than in a standard mini which is why you\\'d go for something \\nlike this over something like that ha ve you ever thought to yourself huh what does the interior of an 83 \\n000 car look like well let\\'s go let\\'s go check that out okay let\\'s talk about the interior now because all \\njokes aside this is a really nice place to be a couple of weeks ago now i was in the mini jcw three door \\nwhich is only a few thousand dollars less than this but this comes with so much more in terms of its \\nengine and drivetrain and then interior space which is probably more important that\\'s definitely more of \\nlike a bachelor\\'s car this  is definitely more of a well a practical car the first thing that\\'s always struck me \\nwith the interior of minis and bmw really is just the quality it\\'s all really solid in here you got some you \\nknow strange interesting patterns on here but they\\'re not bad  and even the harder plastics like here \\nthey\\'re still soft i love this too you get alcantara here on the doors it\\'s a really cool touch i love alcantara \\nthen you\\'ve got the classic mini design touches like these toggle switches here they just feel so nice to \\nclick they\\'re also up here as well where you can also control your sunroof but we\\'ll put that back down \\nbecause it\\'s freezing today the other thing i love about mini interiors and this is the same of course is \\nthat you get these like interactive interio r led lights so when you change the temperature control it \\nshows up here when you change into different sport modes it changes the interior lighting or you can \\nuse this toggle up here to get the same effect it\\'s just really cool speaking of air conditionin g controls \\nthey\\'re really easy to use they work i like them too this steering wheel it\\'s a really nice steering wheel \\nit\\'s out of the bmw parts bin but that\\'s not a bad thing because it\\'s honestly one of my favorites it\\'s \\nsuper thick and chunky snap leathe r so it\\'s nice to hold on to the john cooper works badge down the \\nbottom and it\\'s just really functional and you can also control your adaptive cruise control which was \\nnew for the facelift so that\\'s cool the one thing i\\'m not so sure about is the digital instrument cluster the \\nmore i use it the less i like it it\\'s just really basic and competitors especially at this price point like the \\naudi q3 they just do it way better it\\'s functional enough but um the only real thing you can adjust on it is \\na tiny slive r of display right down the bottom but it\\'s cool party trick is that because it\\'s mounted on the \\nsteering wheel column when you move the steering wheel up and down it moves with it so that\\'s pretty \\ncool kind of same with the heads -up display it was the sam e issue that i had in the mini three door in \\nthat i can\\'t really see it at a lot of positions because the steering wheel would just block it maybe maybe \\nnext time bmw just projected onto the windscreen like you do in your other cars i think it\\'s a better \\nsolution one thing that\\'s stolen straight from bmw and i\\'m not mad about it is the infotainment display \\nnow it\\'s small 8.8 inches in today\\'s day is actually quite small you know hyundai\\'s are coming with 10.25 \\ninch displays are standard and they\\'re really g ood this is still very good it\\'s high definition really easy to \\nuse i prefer using the idrive controller down here though again it\\'s just like small things it\\'s just a bit too \\n\\nfar back so i\\'m finding i\\'m having to have my arm like that which is not comfortable but it\\'s still a very \\ngood system easy to use super high definition and very responsive too it\\'s pretty functional yet \\nnavigation digital radio wireless apple carplay but no android auto but otherwise it\\'s decent speaking of \\nwireless you get a wireless charger here and i\\'ve got a i\\'ve got a ginormous iphone 13 pro max thing and \\nand that doesn\\'t fit but of all the mini wireless chargers i\\'ve tried this is the widest so if yo u don\\'t have a \\nhuge chunk of a phone you\\'ll probably be able to use it unlike in the mini three door although you do \\nget a usb a port up front a 12 volt socket and under here you get a little usbc port so plenty of ways to \\ncharge your devices if they\\'re to o fat to fit in there the cool thing about this armrest is that it ratchets \\nand you\\'ve got a storage area under there you\\'ve got a storage area up front and a couple of cup \\nholders here oh i should mention you get pretty massive door bins and glove box it\\' s a pretty decent \\nsize what else oh the seats how can i forget the seats these are the mini your seats and unlike again the \\nmini three door they\\'re electric it\\'s amazing the 83 grand who could have expected electric adjusting \\nseats but they are really real ly good super super comfy and they\\'re quite well bolstered too they\\'re \\nheated too that\\'s lovely look you get little touches like the union jack on the side and of course the \\nheadrest is a massive union jack the germans really don\\'t want you to forget that you\\'re in a british car \\nnah it\\'s called design touches oh and you get a harman kardon sound system sounds really good i\\'m \\ntrying to think about what i i really don\\'t like in here and honestly it\\'s just nitpicking it\\'s a really nice \\nplace to be but even bet ter i think is the back seats because it\\'s super usable let\\'s go check that out okay \\nso the rear so on 5 foot 11 i have so much toe room so much leg room and so much head room it is \\nsuper spacious back here surprisingly so because the outside really isn\\'t that big the inside because this \\nis a giant square you do have so much room get little pockets back here you get your little air vents no \\nthird zone climate control but it\\'s good enough you get two usbc fast charge ports there the back seats \\nget their own sunroof again it\\'s just a really nice touch these seats these mini yours leather seats back \\nhere they\\'re just as nice as up front i really like them you don\\'t get an arm rest which is a bit of a shame \\nalthough you can just oh my god you can just do that an d have a pseudo arm rest but that\\'s effort oh \\nand a couple of party tricks look you can slide these leads back and forth like a real suv or if you find the \\npull tab thing you can you can you can recline so yeah that\\'s pretty good and really this is the big gest \\nreason why you would buy this over a standard mini because the mini is uh really mini and this mini is a \\nproper suv you have actual loads of room back here no compromises up front you don\\'t have to slide \\nthe seat forward to fit back here this is a tru e family car yet it\\'s still small and nimble enough to to be a \\ncity car so i i really appreciate that let\\'s talk about some specs before we talk about specs check this out \\ni love the way that this opens up and it leaves the headlights there i don\\'t know wh y it\\'s just really cool \\nso the whole range starts with the cooper that starts at just over 50 000 australian that will get you a \\n100 kilowatt three -cylinder turbocharged petrol engine it doesn\\'t sound like a lot i mean it\\'s not but it\\'s \\na pretty sprightly engine i actually really like it however what you really want is this just behemoth of a \\nof a hot suv because that will get you the bmw b48 four cylinder it is a turbocharged unit of course and \\nit pumps out 225 kilowatt of power 450 newton meters of torque  and as you\\'ll find out on the drive \\nyeah this thing is quick the whole range starts with the pure and that\\'s 70 000 australian dollars and this \\njcw mini yours that will set you back around 83 000 australian dollars that is a lot of money but it does \\ncompe te with cars like the bmw x2 m35i which i reviewed and you can click up somewhere there to \\nwatch that and as you\\'ll see this isn\\'t any ordinary car this is a true performance car and what better \\nway to show you that than by doing some launch control okay s o mini claim that this countryman jcw \\ndoes at 100 kilometers an hour in just 5.1 seconds but let\\'s see what it will actually do so we\\'ll put the \\ntransmission into s put the car into sport mode we\\'ll turn off the traction 1 so it puts on dynamic \\ntraction co ntrol and then all we need to do is break and floor the accelerator so let\\'s do that [Music] oh \\nman oh this thing is so fast so 0 -100 in 5.4 seconds that\\'s not the best but to be fair as i said it\\'s a wet \\nday still the all -wheel drive system here did a rea lly good job at hooking up and we\\'ll come back to \\ndriving in a moment i promise but yeah this thing is this thing is pretty quick for a for a family suv all \\n\\nright i think it\\'s about time we take this thing on the road okay so here we are on the roads and of \\ncourse it\\'s horrific weather but that\\'s not actually a bad thing because well this is an all -wheel drive and \\nso what better way to test out the grip of an all-wheel drive suv than by by flooring it in the rain so yes \\nthis has mini\\'s all four system as they brand it which really just means it\\'s a front -wheel drive biased all -\\nwheel drive system so it will send power to the rear wheels when it thinks it needs t o but most of the \\ntime it\\'s just front -wheel drive so before we get to the twisties let\\'s talk about how it performs on the \\nhighway and frankly really really well i was really expecting a car with extremely extremely stiff \\nsuspension but you don\\'t get that  right now i\\'m in mid mode which is like their way of saying normal \\nand so the adaptive dampers are at their slackers and so at these high speeds i\\'m super impressed \\nbecause it\\'s not crashy it\\'s not like jumping you around it\\'s really reasonable we can als o put the car into \\ngreen ooh that\\'s like eco mode and it kind of just dulls everything down but what we really want is sport \\nmode you can hear that the exhaust opens up the steering becomes quite heavy and it\\'s really good \\nbecause it\\'s only one and a half turns locked to lock so it feels a lot more nimble than it probably should \\nand of course our throttle response becomes much better and that becomes equally better when we \\nput the transmission into sport mode so let\\'s do that one thing i\\'ve noticed with a l ot of minis is that you \\ndo get quite a bit of road noise and wind noise and i presume that comes down to the fact that they\\'re \\nessentially rolling squares it also doesn\\'t help that these are on run flat tires and so they just create \\nquite a bit more noise when you add it with the 19 -inch alloy wheels you know it\\'s not the it\\'s not the \\ngreatest recipe for comfort and and and quietness but it does pretty well alrighty let\\'s give this thing \\nsome sauce [Music] oh yeah so power is sent through an eight -speed tor que converter transmission and \\nit\\'s it\\'s a really good transmission up shifts are really smooth and seamless as are downshifts but we\\'re \\nin the twisty so we\\'ve got to give this thing some twisty source and what i won\\'t be doing is turning off \\nthe uh tracti on control on a day like this uh i think you can all understand this is one of the things i \\nactually like more about this car than the three -door mini is that this is an all -wheel drive and that \\nmeans that it does have so much more grip than a front -wheel drive car in this kind of weather a front -\\nwheel drive or even a rear -wheel drive car they become useless i\\'m actually going to do a little test here \\nso as i said this is front -wheel drive bias it\\'s really wet outside right now let\\'s see how long it takes f or it \\nto send power to the rear okay so let\\'s do it that was pretty instantaneous as i said the weather \\nconditions right now are horrific so for it to be able to hook up like that i\\'m really impressed this is the \\nultimate test though ladies and gents saucy  corner let\\'s give it some sauce took a while to move there \\noh there we go okay so a bit of understeer but it hooks up really well it\\'s not scrambling for traction it\\'s \\ndoing a really good job that exhaust sound is so good too now some of that is pumped in  of course but \\nit\\'s not too obtrusive and the exhaust genuinely does have a few crackles and pop to it some things that \\nthis actually has over a standard countryman is it\\'s got a stiffer body you\\'ve got bracing up in the engine \\nbay and it just uses a bit m ore adhesives and you can tell because when you chuck this thing around the \\ncorner as i said even on a wet day like today it still does very well okay so we\\'re in a bit of a residential \\narea here let\\'s put the transmission into normal and the car into mid or normal and it really does just \\nbecome an entirely different beast this is where it really feels like any car on the road sometimes you \\nreally do forget that this car has as much power as it does until of course you put your foot down and it \\npulls hard t he other thing that really impressed me was braking because the brakes on these things are \\ntremendous for example if i do a full emergency stop god yeah it\\'s really really good it just stops really \\nquickly the brakes up front especially are absolutely enor mous so it\\'s really got the whole package it\\'s \\ngot everything i\\'m kind of shocked i didn\\'t expect much from this i\\'ll be honest with you but it surprised \\nme this thing is surprisingly good i\\'ve gotta give it source one more time one more time oh yes so wha t\\'s \\nmy final verdict on the mini cooper countryman jcw all for something in all seriousness i think that this \\nthing is is really cool even though it\\'s an suv i would probably buy it over the three -door because the \\nthree -door comes with way less power it\\'s front -wheel drive this is all -wheel drive it is a true sports car \\nin every sense of the word this thing is fully kitted out and yes it\\'s feeling a little bit old in a tooth maybe \\n\\nin some areas but mini have done a really good job at keeping everything updated i wouldn\\'t go for the \\nthe mini yours you don\\'t need to spend 83 grand on this car i think the pure at 70 grand is is a much \\nbetter buy and you get essentially all you would ev er really need anyway but i\\'m curious what do you \\nguys think of the mini cooper countryman jcw or4 i don\\'t even know would you buy one let me know in \\nthe comment section below just below that like button subscribe if you\\'re new to the channel i\\'d love to \\nhave you around and as always i\\'ll see you next week  \\n \\n \\nCar Model : 2022 Mini Countryman  \\nReview : let\\'s floor it off the land look at this kind of slow i can\\'t even beat this lexus es and there\\'s an old \\nwow i can\\'t make it up probably an 80 year old lady driving that and i couldn\\'t beat her off the line that\\'s \\nnasty today i find myself inside of a mini  cooper countryman and this is like a redemption video because \\ni actually filmed with this exact car just over a month ago and unfortunately that footage was corrupted \\nbut uh i\\'m back better than ever ready to make a video with the countryman final ly and i just want to \\nstart this video off by saying i will be comparing this a little bit to both my well to my clubman video to \\nmy bass mini cooper s video as well as to my x1 video which is actually the most similar car to this based \\non the exact same p latform so i will link all three of those videos down in the description box below and \\ni\\'ll also put cards up to them periodically throughout the video but yeah i will be referring to them and i \\nwill be comparing this a bit to the x1 again in particular bu t just to what else is available within either \\nthe mini range or just in general kind of in this price range for a small german british crossover so uh \\nremember to like this video if you enjoy the content and subscribe if you want to see more stuff like th is \\nand without further ado let\\'s get out onto the road all right so uh setting off here in the base \\ncountrymen first things first the most glaring characteristic and factor of this uh base countryman is the \\nengine so i want to knock that off straight off t he bat uh it\\'s a lethargic power plant at best it\\'s a 1.5 liter \\nturbocharged three -cylinder engine producing a whopping 134 horsepower and pound -feet of torque so \\nnothing to write home about and it is the weakest link i think of this particular car i mean overall decent \\nchassis built on a solid platform obviously front -wheel drive biased uh in this case just front wheel drive \\neven when you get the all four up to the jcw it only comes in all four uh it\\'s still front wheel drive biased \\nbut not a bad car excep t not a lot of power 0 -60 happens in nine seconds which again you know i\\'m not \\nsaying people are looking to buy this for the sake of driving a sporty car but i also understand that we\\'re \\nin a world now where a lot of basic suvs do zero 60 faster than nine seconds i think a jeep wrangler does \\n060 a couple seconds faster than nine seconds or at least around seven or eight seconds so this is a little \\non the slower side in that regard and i think if you want to cut two seconds off that 0 -60 time you \\ndefinitely should spend the extra money and go for the s model in fact i typically tend to believe that \\nthroughout the entire mini range those s models are kind of that sweet spot between options \\nperformance and price but nonetheless this happens to be an oxford edit ion so some of you might know \\nwhat that means and i\\'m going to explain what it means but basically before i explain i will say that it is \\na tremendous value proposition to get an oxford edition and because this particular car is an oxford \\nedition i\\'ll make  the claim to say hey you know what if you want to grab an oxford edition then maybe \\nyou should go ahead and get a countryman over say a countryman s or another model in the range so \\nwhat does the oxford edition get you well the oxford edition actually use d to be a package only \\navailable to either i think current college students or recent college grads and i think as of maybe a year \\nor so ago they\\'ve switched that to allow anyone able to buy one i know there are some caveats with the \\noxford program like or  the oxford edition program where you aren\\'t able to either get another any other \\nadditional discount on the car any sort of other incentive applied they\\'re used to not let you lease them \\ni think you can lease them now but again i think the price is what i t is but what does that mean so a base \\n\\ncountryman starts at just over 29 000 and the oxford edition gives you a credit of six hundred dollars \\nreducing the price of this particular car after options and destination to just over twenty seven thousand \\ndollars so that\\'s right two thousand dollars l ess than the normal starting price of a base countryman \\nthat\\'s fantastic and along with that reduced price you actually get led headlights up front with the drls \\nto go all the way around auto high beam it\\'s delightful great nighttime light performance you get the led \\ntail lights that give you the union jack insignia in them just like most of the mini in fact the entire mini \\nrange now at least has optional uh and then you get the larger screen here on the inside you get the \\npano sunroof you get the black hea dliner i mean blacked out wheels 18 inches uh the rubber this is a \\nbase countryman it\\'s 225 all season rubber another weak point but this is a slow crossover so i\\'ll give it a \\npass here but the point is you get a pretty solid package for the price for the money for sure in my \\nopinion [Music] now the thing is that base engine it\\'s paired to an eight -speed acen i believe is how you \\npronounce it automatic which is an okay transmission it\\'s not nearly as good as either any sort of zf8 \\nspeed or the dual clutch s even speeds in some of the other mini lineup or models in the lineup and i \\nfound that this level of power is really not enough to push a sub 3 000 pound car around very fast or \\nvery quickly and here at around 3 500 pounds it it does have a hard time and th ere are many points in \\nwhich i\\'m merging into a faster speed major road or onto the highway where i\\'m like oof this is really \\nnot enough power and i feel concerned the car behind me is gonna i\\'m not not gonna hit me but just \\ncatching up to me annoyed with me and that i don\\'t feel that in most cars i drive these days obviously i \\ncertainly don\\'t feel it in a fast or quick car but even in your typical say q5 you don\\'t feel that anymore so \\nthe fact that you\\'re doing this a little disappointing but this is kind of where i want to start comparing \\nthis car to the x1 because there are some pros and cons between the two again they\\'re built on the \\nsame platform but they have very different characters and a slightly different experience thus because \\nof those characters  so i drove an x1 which i\\'ll link up above or put a card to and i found it to be a decent \\nexperience but there were a couple big drawbacks the first one is price where this is 27 000 just about \\nthat was nearly 40 000. i think it was 39 and changed just und er 40 000 that\\'s a sizable difference in \\nprice now for that difference you do happen to get a good bit more power actually almost 100 more \\nhorsepower and also a little bit more torque so it\\'s not for nothing and that particular car actually \\nhappened to be an x drive i believe so it had that front -wheel drive bias all -wheel drive system that you \\ncan get in the all four version of the countrymeter country and s but and you get standard in jcw but uh \\nit was an option on that car so another advantage adds more weight but still um i just found that on one \\nhand the interior felt like the most disappointing bmw interior i\\'ve ever been in where this feels like a \\nreally nice mini interior my expectations are a bit less on the price is a bit less on top of that this i nterior \\nhas a bit more character you have that light that goes around the central screen everything is circular \\nyour gauges are a little funky which i want to get into in a second but you have the funky gauges you \\nhave this gray colored trim midway across your kind of center stack area so you get some charm in here \\non the exterior you get the mini cooper look and provenance that maybe you\\'re into i\\'m guessing if \\nyou\\'re buying one of these you\\'re into or considering one of these you\\'re into it\\'s polarizing b ut for \\nthose who like it they do like it a lot in fact love it and those who don\\'t well it\\'s another story for \\nanother day but the thing that i found that i really didn\\'t like about the x1 was that almost any time \\nsomeone pulled up alongside you in another  bmw they were in a nicer bmw than you because there\\'s \\nsomething to say about the badge appeal of a bmw over a mini obviously bmw owns mini but having a \\nbmw badge on your steering wheel having one up front on your hood people some people like that they \\nwan t to say hey i have a bmw but when you have an x1 and then someone has an x3 or an x5 or an x7 \\ni\\'m not saying you should care but sometimes you think well that must be even nicer where in a \\ncountryman i\\'m not saying this is better than any other mini but i t\\'s more equal to the rest of the range \\neven a hardtop s doesn\\'t really seem like this superior car to this although of course a more sporty fun \\nexperience and i did drive one of those too which i\\'ll link up above i love that that\\'s like my bread and \\nbutte r mini cooper experience is a ideally a manual s hard top actual hard top coupe whatever you want \\n\\nto call it no convertible but you know two door but i\\'ll still i still take the even the seven speed dual \\nclutch i\\'ll take that over this but that kind of explains where my head space is at it\\'s not that i\\'m against \\nthe x1 it\\'s just that i feel like for 12  000 or less i\\'m okay with this being a little slower having a bit more \\ncharming character and uh still offering you most of the amenities you still have the led headlights and \\ntell us you still have a decent screen here the one thing i did notice is reall y really really really sucky in \\nhere is the audio system it\\'s really bad very poor and it\\'s not nearly as good as a base bmw system so i \\nthink that car i drove it\\'s been a while so i don\\'t remember if you had the harman kardon or if i had the \\nbase system b ut even the base system in that x1 is better than the base system here where the harman \\nkardon audio is deeply deeply missed and the clubman i drove which i can also link up to at some point \\nthat did have the look let\\'s floor it off the land look at this k ind of slow i can\\'t even beat this lexus es and \\nthere\\'s an old wow i can\\'t make it up probably an 80 year old lady driving that and i couldn\\'t beat her off \\nthe line that\\'s nasty in a 2014 lexus es350 but yeah the point is very slow um but the clubman had t he \\nharman kardon audio system and i really really missed that also that club menace had a jb4 piggyback \\ntune which gives you very minimal power gains but about 30 40 horsepower and puts you right around \\nwhere the jcw models used to be in the 220 230 range so that feels a lot faster than this when they\\'re \\nabout the same weight maybe that weighs 50 pounds more than this 100 pounds more than this \\nbecause of the bigger engine but boy with nearly 230 horsepower at the crank versus 135 it\\'s a \\ndifference it\\'s a di fference you really feel someone who wants a brand new mini cooper with some nice \\namenities this large screen on the inside the sunroof the led headlights you\\'re getting a lot of value out \\nof the oxford pack but i do want to mention one thing which is that  the mini cooper countryman was \\nface lifted both in 2021 which is actually this car\\'s model year as well as in 2022 the models that are now \\nhitting dealers although scarce and hard to find in the current car market with the chip shortage but i \\nwanted to ex plain what the facelift in general brought and what the slight second facelift within one \\nmodel year\\'s prop so this 2021 car on the exterior is identical to a 2022 car you get the exact same \\nrefreshed front fascia with the new headlights you get the new ta il lights a couple other little tweaks but \\nreally that front fascia has been a little bit revised to keep up with the rest of the mini cooper lineup on \\nthe inside you get the new screen here that\\'s a little bit more flush and that\\'s kind of and you get the  \\nnew shifter here for the automatic transmission and that is all again in line with 2021 and 2022 \\nmechanically identical the only difference and i have driven the 2022 hardtop s so you can check that to \\nsee the footage maybe i\\'ll inlay it here is that a 20 22 model would have a different steering wheel and \\ndifferent gauge cluster which would be that semi semi -digital cluster in the 2022 and the steering wheel \\nwithout this weird engrave and it\\'s a bit thicker chunkier and it has well the button layout is the same \\nbut the buttons are flat um actually as much as i like that new steering wheel i don\\'t like this engrave \\nand i like the chunkier component the buttons are a little bit more inset here and i don\\'t find myself \\npressing them by accident where on that ste ering wheel in the hard top s especially with some spirited \\ndriving i was constantly pressing them and it was driving me crazy now before we wrap the video up we \\ngotta jump into a quick tall boy test and discuss some of the practicality of this car and we\\' ll be done so \\nhere\\'s the tallboy test [Music] so to wrap the video up some of the strengths of the countryman in \\ngeneral and this would be true regardless of engine although the clubman only comes in the s and the \\njcw but still nonetheless some of the adva ntages are you do have a much larger greenhouse here while i \\nlike that low wide kind of long look of the clubman more than this certainly and i even like the driving \\nexperience that slightly different dynamic it kind of provides you get better visibility o ut of this no \\nquestion about it that rear window is much larger your side windows are a bit larger again you just have \\nmore of a greenhouse some more space you feel a little bit more spacious or whatever comfortable you \\nsit higher up so you feel like you\\'r e in a crossover or even an suv actually more so than even the x1 but \\ncertainly a lot more so than either a hard top or a clubman even because the clubman\\'s about the same \\nheight as a hard top so you get that extra size and feel but that also translates to  a bit more legroom \\nand headroom in the back so someone i would say some of my size at about six two would feel much \\n\\nmore comfortable sitting in the back of this than the clubman and there\\'s not even a question about \\nhow uncomfortable the back of either a two -door or four -door hardtop is in comparison other than that \\ni mean this is a car that i like i know some people di sagree and think it\\'s a goofy car and i would take a \\nclubman over this and then i would take a hard top over that and so on and so forth but if i had to pick \\nbetween a an x1 or a mini cooper country i would probably go with the countryman for the character  \\nand charm it provides and if you want to kind of hit that middle price point between an x1 and a base \\ncountryman it\\'s a countryman s it gives you almost the power output or basically effectively the \\nperformance of the next one still going to cost less mon ey and it\\'s going to have a bit more charm and \\nquirkiness which you might as well have you\\'re driving a small crossover you\\'re not driving some sort of \\nbig luxo suv and you\\'re not driving some sort of sporty rally type vehicle like a gla 45 for instance so  you \\nmight as well buy in have some fun this is a cool car for what it is just very slow but i\\'ve enjoyed driving \\nit and if you guys enjoyed the video please remember to like comment subscribe new videos are \\ndropping every single week on fridays comment do wn below let me know what you guys want to see i\\'ll \\ndo my best to make it happen and as always this is rio peace out  \\n \\nCar Model : 2022 Mini Countryman  \\n \\nReview : [Laughter] [Music] do [Music] what\\'s going on guys and welcome back to the hungry road my \\nname is eric and thank you again for tuning in i appreciate you sticking around with me this week\\'s \\nrental is the 2022 mini cooper countryman this is the all four so it is all wheel drive but we\\'ll get to some \\nof those specs later so i did something a little different this week i actually drove the car to my site \\nusually i fly in and i get the rental car at the airport but this week i was in connecticut and tha t\\'s why i \\npicked this guy up at the bradley international airport and there were these available there was this \\nbeautiful ice blue metallic one and a british racing green one i like the blue better so i got the blue so \\nlet\\'s go over some of the features so me of the cool things uh some of the things that i would like to talk \\nabout and show off and um yeah let\\'s see let\\'s get started so let me give you some brief history here the \\nmini corporation made its debut in 1969 but the name mini had been using other m odels up to 10 years \\nbefore that until bmw purchased the rover group in 2000 which included the mini corporation as well as \\nland rover which was then sold off to ford and we don\\'t know what happened with that currently on the \\nmarket mini offers seven diffe rent varieties the two -door mini the four -door mini the countryman mini \\nthe clubman mini which is like an elongated station wagon version of this car here then there\\'s the two -\\ndoor convertible then there\\'s the electric car and there\\'s the john cooper works  editions of all of those \\ntrims but this one here again is the countryman an ice blue metallic with the all four and signature \\npackage so the all four gives you all -wheel drive and this signature package gives you heated seats gives \\nyou touch screen interf ace for your infotainment system gives you the bigger 18 inch wheels up from 17 \\ninch and dual zone climate it costs you about an extra 3 000 but i think it\\'s absolutely worth it but you \\nonly get the measly 132 horsepower if you don\\'t have the s or the john  cooper works edition engines so \\n1.5 liter three cylinder turbo if you get the s model or if you get the john coop works edition you get a \\nbigger engine you get a two liter single turbo three cylinder which gives you a lot more horsepower so \\nthe s model wi ll give you 192 horsepower which gets your zero to 60 up from 9.6 seconds to 7.6 seconds \\nthe john cooper works edition will give you a 4.9 second zero to 60 and that\\'s much faster and feels \\nmore like a regular car than this one does here but like many cars  these days you do have the hands -\\nfree option of getting into the tailgate here kick your foot very quickly underneath the middle of the car \\nand the trunk will open all by itself it is fully motorized but inside the trunk it\\'s not that big so on the \\nwebsit e they advertise like i said earlier seats for five and all your luggage pretend i\\'m all your luggage if \\nyou watch a tesla video you will know the unit of measurement i use is an arab d weaver so now i\\'m in \\n\\nthe trunk here and i\\'m pretty sure it won\\'t close let\\'s see as you can see five pieces of luggage does not \\nfit in the mini cooper and if you\\'re stuck in here it won\\'t shut on you to close it do the same thing or you \\ncan press the buttons up here so you hav e an option to close the trunk without locking it or you can \\npress the lock button here and it will close the lid and lock it to open the hood pull the lever on the \\ndriver\\'s side foot well wants to unlock the hood again to unlatch the hood then you can wal k around the \\nfront of the vehicle and lift the hood right up without having a fumble looking for latches and all kinds of \\nstuff so this is your key here it\\'s a very simple key fob i do love the design of it it\\'s very different very \\nrounded like the rest of  the car is mini logo on the back there unlock button at the top mini logo in the \\nmiddle is the lock button trunk button is the third one down here but if you happen to battery dies and \\nyou get locked out your car there\\'s a silver button on the side press that silver button and you can \\nrelease the hard key here put this key into the slot down here in the bottom all the way in that\\'s in and \\nyou can just take off the silver panel here remove the key stick your key in turn counterclockwise you \\nwill see the loc king mechanism rise up here remove the key and then you can open the door i would call \\nthe interior a very modern retro if that makes any sense at all so what i mean is that we have things like \\ntoggle switches you know from like old school airplanes and ma chinery back in the day but we have this \\ngiant led ring around the outside and an eight -inch touchscreen here which has your hazards up here at \\nthe top parking features right here you can turn off and on some of the features there turn it back off \\nget back  to the home menu we have our radio stations down here in the bottom volume control there \\nclimate control right here and watch what happens to this led ring when i start to adjust the \\ntemperatures right now it\\'s at 60 degrees if i turn it up the ring now d isplays a cute color combo and as i \\nturn the temperature up to 81 degrees the white light over here is over there on the hot side turn it \\nback close toward the medium and the blue over here say this happen to the passenger side over there \\nyeah same thing n ow just the fan speed it gives me a different sort of uh display here i mean this is just \\nso cool it\\'s so responsive it\\'s just so unique i haven\\'t seen any of the car that does anything like that i hit \\nthe heated seats no nothing okay but to start the car you put your foot on the brake and you flick this \\neither down hope to turn the car off or flick it up to start it auto stop start here click that and it should \\nlight up there let you know auto stop start is off and you can just flick it back if you want it  on charging \\ncontrols right here to put the car in gear put your foot on the brake press the thumb in on the left side \\nhere and pull the knob all the way back so now the car isn\\'t drive with the green light illuminated by the \\nd you want to go into neutral just pushing forward one time goes into neutral then you get a message \\nhere about securing the vehicle before it rolls and if you want to put it in reverse hold the button in \\npush all the way forward then we have the reverse light lit up next to the r to p ut it in park or press the \\np button but first we\\'ll check out the reverse camera pretty pretty cool one more thing i did want to \\nshow you that i noticed earlier let\\'s back up into these trees and watch what that screen see the screen \\nstarts to freak out wh en you get close to stuff so he\\'s orange orange red yeah so i want you to stop but \\nwe\\'ll drive back out of this mess i don\\'t want to have any problems here and to put the car in park foot \\non the brake press to pee and it goes in the park i must admit as cu te as this car is these door handles \\nare a little weird i\\'m used to being able to put my hand through and pull something and then pull the \\ndoor open but instead you have to reach and pull backwards to open the door so you can kind of see \\nthe mechanism ther e just looks a little strange so i\\'m used to grabbing it my wrist is all twisted and stuff \\nand pulling it open but and you would get used to it up top here we have some more cute toggle \\nswitches the two on the far left and right will control your lights yo u just click it once the light comes on \\nclick it again the light goes off if you click this one here all the lights come on so one two three clicking \\nfor it to go off and we see these green dots right here this one controls your ambient lighting settings s o \\nif you scroll through them it\\'ll change blue a deeper blue almost indigo purple fuchsia red orange yellow \\ngreen yellow orange green i mean there\\'s so many colors here and the ambient light is reflected down \\nhere in the door well so there we go that\\'s a b lue light blue you can just kind of scroll through these \\nseemingly forever but obviously it looks much better in the night time so here\\'s a better look at the \\n\\nambient lighting we got the red got the orange yellow orange yellow [Music] lime green green super \\ngreen blue purple and all the colors are here so you can kind of cycle through these at will but it\\'s really \\ncool the last taco switch in the middle here doe s control your panoramic sunroof so you do need to \\nopen the moonroof first and slide the netting back manually but then if you toggle this one more time \\nthe roof does slide back on its own now the rear roof back here isn\\'t motorized or anything as you can \\nsee the top roof slides over that one so you open that when they would run into each other but you do \\nget plenty of air coming in through here you have a diffuser up here to block the wind or make you \\nknow reduce the noise that comes with the car but if yo u want to close it press it forward the roof will \\ncome back press it again to lower the moon roof and seal it there we go the seats in the mini cooper \\ncountrymen are not motorized you can get a motorized if you option up for the iconic pack which is \\nanothe r seventy eight hundred dollars which comes with a lot more features but that\\'s neither hit right \\nthere we do have a lever in the front to move the seat forward and back you pull up here and you slide \\nit while you\\'re sitting in the seat we have this guy he re if you pull it up it raises the seat if you push on it \\nit lowers it back down i mean it\\'s a little cumbersome and tedious but it gets the job done how often are \\nyou really moving your seat so we just have a fairly versatile armrest here hold the button lift up on the \\ntop half of the armrest we have facing two ketchups 75 cents there\\'s a nice rubber mat down here so \\nthings don\\'t slide all around everywhere close this and now you have an adjustable armor you have \\nmore space down in here you put several pho nes no pads pins whatever but i can always like this is too \\nlow a little bit now it\\'s sit up here or somewhere in the middle so we are inside the 2022 mini cooper \\ncountryman as i said before i\\'ve already put about a thousand miles on this car here so i can  give you a \\npretty quick synopsis of what i think about it so i do have a little uh stretch of road here i\\'m gonna be \\nable to punch it or feather it because that\\'s all the power this engine has all right i\\'m at a stoplight i\\'m \\nfoot is to the floor foot is bought is pedaled to the metal right now 45 miles an hour 49 52 55 finally 60. \\nlike that\\'s terrible but if you\\'re not out here to be driving fast and whipping it like a race car then you \\nmay not need all that power but i do because it\\'s more fun a wise phi losopher once said all those who \\ndrive fast are not in a hurry i said that i\\'m the wise philosopher but aside from that the ride it\\'s like a car \\nit\\'s a little softer than a car but it\\'s not giant ford f -150 floating above cloud type saw you do feel the \\nbum ps the suspension is moderate like everything\\'s fine the steering is decent rather tight i love the feel \\nof the steering wheel it\\'s nice and thick unlike my ford taurus i have at home it\\'s a lot thinner it\\'s always \\nweird when i get in and grab it but yeah this is a comfortable steering wheel the ride\\'s decent like you \\nknow this is an average car but you\\'re paying kind of for like the background bmw name because you \\nknow bmw makes the mini well yeah the features are here you know it\\'s a decent ride all right  we got a \\nbetter pov angle here let\\'s roll these windows up over here they are all automatic foot on the brake \\npress a little button and we pull out and let\\'s get this going so as we\\'re coming to a red light here one of \\nthe uh more annoying things about th e car is the stop start feature so yes it\\'s economical to have it on \\nor whatever so now we are at a red light my foot goes all the way on the brake as you can see the rpm \\nhas dropped to the ready section so the engine is off right now but i\\'m gonna turn th e auto stop start \\noff and you can hear the car kick back into life but i don\\'t feel the engine moving and when i go to \\naccelerate or take off it still feels like the auto stop start is still on i don\\'t know if that\\'s because of the \\nlack of horsepower or th e way the engine is set up or if they really want you to have an auto stop start \\non but it just doesn\\'t feel like the engine\\'s on when i go to take off and you\\'ll see here in a second all \\nright see what i mean like there\\'s that hesitancy of when you go to put your foot on the gas from the \\nbrake and just doesn\\'t feel like the engine\\'s on and still feel like the engine had to start up and then then \\nyou could continue on but that is one thing i i am annoyed with this car i mean granted yeah i got great \\ngas mil eage average about 30 miles a gallon on the way here from connecticut 16 gallon tank did 500 \\nand it felt like 550 miles or well over half the trip on one tank of gas and i think that\\'s pretty good but \\nyeah i mean that little stop start it\\'s not you\\'re not saving that much gas it\\'s the three liter 1.5 cylinder \\nengine that saves the gas another thing that bugs me about this car is the way the cruise control and the \\n\\nspeed limiter are set up so if you look at my left hand here the middle button is cruise control i\\'m going \\nto turn it on for 55 miles an hour and i\\'m going to press the positive sign which sets it so now it\\'s set at \\n60. let\\'s say i want to decrease it i ca n press the bottom button down one click is a mile per hour if i give \\nit a good click it goes down five miles per hour but let\\'s say i want to speed up which i usually do on a \\nhighway i give it a couple good clicks but the speed limiter button is right her e to the right of the cruise \\ncontrol so there have been many instances of on the drive here from connecticut where i\\'ve tried to \\nspeed up and i\\'ve pressed the limiter button and as you can see i just did it so now my speed is limited \\nat 60 miles an hour bu t i really want to go 65 so now i\\'m trying to increase the speed so now i\\'ve set the \\nlimiter to 80 miles an hour but cruise control has been turned off so now i need to go back turn the \\nlimiter off press cruise control and it gets set back down to what i w as just doing so i got to click it up \\nagain and then we have this this be you know this it says i\\'m nitpicking a little bit but it happened \\nnumerous times maybe because i got fat fingers people you thin fingered people out there it might not \\nhappen to y\\'al l but it happened to me numerous times so that\\'s just one thing i didn\\'t like is the limiter \\nis right next to the cruise control who even wants a speed limiter like what is even a point i guess if \\nyou\\'re a speed demon not in this car though you can\\'t be a speed demon in this car here\\'s p demon and \\nyou gotta limit yourself then you can put the limiter on but whatever so let\\'s talk more about this led \\ndisplay right here so in your display menu you have what\\'s called the center instrument option that is \\nwhat t his is here you click on it and there\\'s different ways you can have it set up so there\\'s different \\nevents that will trigger this thing to move the heartbeat is a little red pulsing thing right here when you \\nfirst turn the car on your parking assistant is w hen i demonstrated the car backing into something your \\ntelephone so you have a phone call it will react to your phone call i mean all these different things are \\nthe climate which i mentioned earlier that had the uh turning this right here this is your clim ate and \\nyour tone which is the volume it does the same thing for that so it\\'s really cool but then there\\'s the basic \\ndisplay which you can leave on ambient lighting which i have right now or you can go down to color \\nscheme and you can turn it to uh like re d for sport mode and there\\'s another one called uh blue for \\nlounge but you can also turn it off or if you want the engine speed to be displayed here you can do that \\nso right now the car is in auto stop start off but i have my red line over here and the res t of this right \\nhere is going to be the rpm so get ready to leave the light right now energy kicked in so here\\'s a little \\nwhite thing here let\\'s mash it look how cool that is i love this little display and if that\\'s no not enough for \\nyou or too much for yo u you can just put it on engine speed and now your speedometer is here this is so \\ncool i think my favorite one would be the ambient lighting especially at night or the engine speed \\nbecause you\\'re getting like a little tachometer right here in the middle of  your screen or your dashboard \\nin conclusion this car sunroof is big enough to fit me through it and that\\'s a hefty sunroof and i got \\nmoon play around but i was left unimpressed with this car i loved the styling loved the color loved the \\ninterior loved the  features i love how retro modern it was the toggle switches and the led lights and the \\nambient lighting and the sound system and the leather i love all those things i was just missing the \\npower so maybe i got the wrong model maybe the s model or the john cooper works editions would be \\nbetter fit for me because i need the power and the luxuries now you\\'re looking at a 40 45 000 price tag \\ncompared to this one here it\\'s in about 35. so i enjoyed the car if you guys guys get a chance to rent one \\nyourself or te st one out please do so let me know what you think but remember there\\'s never an empty \\ntank or an empty stomach on this road i\\'m getting really close to my subscriber goal of 500 i\\'ll be giving \\naway your 101 or one of you who\\'s paying attention stay safe g uys and thank you again for [Music] \\nwatching [Music] [Music] wanna see something satisfying  \\n \\nCar Model : 2021 Mini Countryman  \\n\\nReview : when you make an investment on an automobile you want it to be able to do everything but \\nunfortunately there are limitations for instance well you can\\'t expect the same automobile to be able to \\naccomplish say carry an extra thousand kilos of weight corner like it\\'s a tron light cycle and still be as \\nluxurious as a rolls royce so let\\'s be practical say you\\'re looking for something stylish uh a little bit on the \\nluxurious side definitely sporty and well something that\\'s kind of practical this is the 2 021 mini cooper s \\ncountryman sport now i know it\\'s german and english at the same time but it\\'s aiming to be the swiss \\narmy knife of crossovers aiming to do everything with enough versatility to be the perfect daily drive \\nand more importantly a lot of fun on the weekends [Music] they\\'re that strong up front on the \\ncountryman it has a very familiar mini face though it does ditch the round lights that are found on other \\nminis down the range but it\\'s still undeniably a mini touches of chrome add a little razzl e dazzle so to \\nspeak now i\\'m not the biggest fan of chrome trim but here it fits the upscale vibes this crossover gives \\noff it\\'s got a very aggressive front bumper that house led fog lamps as well as slats located here and on \\nthe other side that actually w ork no faker here another aspect that drives home the sport name are \\nthese 19 -inch two -tone jcw wheels which look absolutely great unfortunately it does provide for well a \\nstiffer ride but we\\'ll get to that a little bit later ground clearance is at a healt hy 165 millimeters \\ndefinitely more than enough for conquering the urban jungle but certainly not confidence inspiring \\nwhen it comes to much much rougher terrain this also is only a front -wheel drive so paired with that \\ndon\\'t expect to be dominating the dak ar rally autodeal.com.ph can connect you to get the best quote \\nfrom multiple dealerships and near you you can request and compare quotes from any dealership in the \\nphilippines get the best deal with autodeal yes it\\'s got a small frame but if you open the b oot with either \\nyour kick assist or power tailgate you\\'re looking at 450 liters of space now that\\'s a lot and it can even \\nmaximize itself to almost 1 500 liters when you fold the second road down there is no lift to speak of so \\nloading heavy things is not a problem and then there\\'s also this it\\'s a cheap thrill but i love it so darn \\nmuch space in the rear cabin of the mini is actually plenty decent you\\'ve got space definitely for two \\naverage the large size adults a third one would be a problem because the t unnel is actually quite high \\nand elbow room is nothing great the seats themselves are firm and supportive but i wish they had a bit \\nmore bolstering because this is a minion you\\'re definitely going to be sliding around during your \\nweekend warrior sessions c omfort is okay when it comes to leg room because that\\'s my normal driving \\nposition even if jack were sitting and driving up there i definitely have enough leg room luxury back here \\nit\\'s actually not bad you\\'ve got your own yes your own sunroof and then you \\'ve got air vents you\\'ve got \\ncharging points that are type c and you\\'ve got a center armrest with two cup holders coupled with ball \\nholders on either door now i did mention that this is a practical automobile and it goes to show you that \\nby folding over so  you have access to the rear which is actually pretty darn cool the front space of the \\ncountryman is actually pretty great it\\'s actually pretty exceptional it\\'s got a lot of character and makes it \\nwell very unique you\\'ve got for instance a lot of toggles i nstead of buttons which include your ignition as \\nwell then there\\'s also your drive mode selectors sunroof control and others these toggles really make \\nfor a unique experience in here another quirk in the automobile that you can\\'t miss is the round housing \\nthat you find in the center for its infotainment screen now it\\'s not just all lights and display they actually \\nhave a function for instance the lights change color and come on when you\\'re in reverse and you\\'re \\ngetting close to uh certain obstacles on the r oad then it also changes depending on your drive modes \\nwhether you\\'re sport or in eco and then there\\'s also one of the lights that turn on when it\\'s well you use \\nit as a tachometer it\\'s not the most accurate but i guess it\\'s just fun to look at the downsid e though is \\nthat the screen is a total of six and a half inches which is at this price point really you expect much more \\nfrom the automobile i mean even an anova has got a larger screen but it does serve its purpose inside a \\nvery tiny cabin and the functio nality of it is actually great in here though you get a system based on \\nbmw\\'s idrive with the quirky touch of mini here and there the main menu echoes other elements of the \\ninterior by being well a circle i guess going through the menu is quick and snappy there\\'s definitely a \\nlearning curve for sure but it\\'s no rocket science navigating the system there is unfortunately no carplay \\n\\nor android auto but connecting your phone to the system through usb or bluetooth and it allows you to \\nsearch and choose what you want to listen to through spotify and other music apps speaking of music \\nthere are harman kardon speakers in here which make fo r a great listening experience though the eq \\ncontrols leave something to be desired in contrast another highlight up here are the leather seats the \\nleather is very darn good with some alcantara -like material on the side and the bolstering to support \\nyou wh en you\\'re going through turns is actually pretty good you\\'ve also got an extension that you can \\nbring out for much taller passengers for thigh support i can\\'t relate but i thought i just mentioned that in \\nterms of cubby holes well you\\'ve got two cup holder s and bottle holders in either door space for one \\npossibly even two phones down there and then you\\'ve got space here and a center armrest with all of \\njack\\'s stuff ah and another touch is the ambient lighting in here you can change it to match whatever \\nmood  that you\\'re in hopefully blue when you\\'re stuck in traffic keep chill keep chill [Music] very unique \\ninside and out i\\'m happy to report that the drive of the countryman itself is also as unique uh depending \\non really what you\\'re looking for it can be good  or bad allow me to explain for starters or rather for \\ninstance would be the steering it\\'s uh it\\'s a very good steering it\\'s very weighted it\\'s very direct the \\ninputs are very sharp and you\\'ll notice that it\\'s very easy to drive inside the city the thing a bout it is \\nregardless of its size you\\'re still thinking that you\\'re purchasing a crossover which you are essentially so \\nfor more people that are looking for a more relaxed drive yeah this might not be for you however if you \\ncan bear with the weighted steer ing and it\\'s something that you\\'re looking forward to especially when \\nyou get out of town and to have a little fun and if you\\'ve got the coin well yeah pick one up immediately \\nthe countryman does weigh a little bit more than 4500 pounds which is a bit on t he heavy side but it is \\npowered by a 2 -liter twin turbo that produces 192 horses and 280 newton meters of torque now to put \\nthat into perspective it would be like putting the fight of a great white shark into a goldfish imagine that \\nthat being said it\\'s no t exactly the kind of power that will tear your face off as you\\'re going back or \\nrather forward in time i get that thing confused what i\\'m trying to say is that the power kicks in roughly \\nat the top end of the rev range so it\\'s smooth till about to get the re now getting off the line if you\\'re \\npunchy and you\\'re in a bit of a hurry it does tend to well slide a little bit because it\\'s not an all -wheel \\ndrive it\\'s a front -wheel drive but the transmission i gotta say is actually pretty smooth whether you\\'re \\non sp ort or eco motor green whatever it is that they call it it\\'s actually very seamless i like the way that it \\nchanges gears without ever having to bother you and knocking on your door and saying excuse me \\nwould you like to go up or down up or down no it just keeps going it drives like a proper crossover it \\nreally does now the suspension does help mitigate the body roll by a lot i gotta add though that if you\\'re \\na person who is much older in their days more seasoned shall we put it and you\\'re not looking for \\nsomething that\\'s a bit bouncy because you obviously want to get yourself a proper crossover then this \\nmight be the kind of car that you will want to skip because well it\\'s not exactly a jcw works car out right \\nbut the suspension and the 19 inch tires with th e 45 series on them yeah that might get old really fast \\nreally really quick if you\\'re looking for a much more comfortable car now for those that are more uh \\nshall we say spry and want to get out there and carve some twists and turns on the weekends or mayb e \\neven on a daily basis yeah look no further technology in here is actually pretty darn good you feel like \\nyou haven\\'t been left behind by science and technology but that being said it\\'s like you\\'re spending so \\nmuch on this automobile and yet it kind of cu ts a few corners for instance we made mention that the \\ndisplay is not the biggest thing on the planet it\\'s only six and a half inches while the housing is just so \\nmassive another is that it does have cruise control but it\\'s not adaptive and i\\'m thinking fo r the price \\nthat i\\'m paying for this guy well darn it i should be spoiled right we should be nvh is not well particularly \\ngood i\\'d give it about an eight out of ten because the wind and tire noise definitely creep in the engine \\nnoise not a problem regardle ss of how much you\\'re pushing it or how deep you\\'re putting your right \\nfoot down on the loud pedal but the wind noise and the road noise yeah that might start getting to you \\nso basically nvh or the noise vibration and harshness in here can be quite harsh a ctually depending on \\nhow you push the car the other thing that\\'s quite harsh but in a good way are the brakes man do they \\n\\nbite and they\\'ll catch you off guard too very surprising because when you step on it it\\'s like it\\'ll stop the \\ncar like there\\'s snow tomorrow it\\'s as shocking as let\\'s say for example answering back your mother \\nwhen you do it you\\'re like oh man that\\'s a bit  scary maybe i shouldn\\'t have done that they\\'re that strong \\nnow when it comes to field economy if you\\'re thinking that it should be good in a car like this you\\'re \\nspot on because in traffic inside the city you\\'re doing 10 kilometers per liter good even bet ter on the \\nhighway double it at 20 kilometers per liter thanks obviously to its 8 -speed automatic transmission \\nthat\\'s just awesome man anyway that you put it we\\'re gonna be very critical about this automobile for \\ntwo things number one is because well of it s price and number two it\\'s because well it\\'s a mini saying \\nthat it\\'s a crossover let\\'s not mince words when you get this yes sure it definitely is a crossover i mean it \\nfits the bill but it\\'s still definitely a mini and you\\'re gonna buy it simply because well it\\'s a go -cart with an \\nair conditioning system with a radio and a boot to boot so you\\'re still gonna expect that roughness from \\nit that those sharp turns the engine that revs really high and a bit of a bouncy ride with 45 series tires \\nbecause well tha t\\'s why you\\'re getting it it\\'s all of that and a bag of potato chips to the right buyer so it \\nseems that the countryman is targeting a very specific fire one who wants all the amenities and the \\ndrivability of a mini and yet still have the capabilities of a  crossover essentially trading off passenger \\ncomfort for driving performance so i guess the question is is it any good one to the right person it\\'s not \\njust good but it\\'s actually great because well it\\'s full of character inside and up and despite being fu ll of \\ngerman handiwork all over the automobile it also has the charm of dry british humor to be honest with \\nyou it\\'s brilliant the mini cooper countryman sport comes in at three million eight hundred and fifty \\nthousand philippine pesos i didn\\'t make a mist ake that\\'s really its price and i know what you\\'re thinking \\nat that figure you can get yourself already a cx -9 which is a hell of a lot bigger more ground clearance \\nand much more comfortable inside so really it\\'s practicality like a swiss army knife is you  know that\\'s out \\nthe window but i will tell you three definite things about it number one is that it\\'s absolutely fun to drive \\nno doubt about that number two it\\'s obviously an object of desire every single person that i\\'ve met well \\nmost of the people that i\\'ve met definitely want a mini and number three it\\'s as sharp as a razor\\'s edge \\nno doubt [Music] you  \\n \\nCar Model : 2021 Mini Countryman  \\nReview : it\\'s nimble it\\'s quick it\\'s entertaining to drive oh me the mini okay we have the countryman and \\nit\\'s one of those vehicles that kind of gets under your skin and once you own one you want to own \\nanother one we\\'ll tell you why looks like the camera is so fa r away the windshield is so far away from \\nwhere you\\'re sitting it\\'s like so we\\'re wait this is actually the top of the the dashboard yeah all right \\nthat\\'s crazy so you\\'re in a mini countryman the least mini of the minis the least minis it\\'s getting  bigger \\nexactly what\\'s under the hood of this thing a two -liter four -cylinder turbo engine with an eight -speed \\nautomatic transmission 189 horsepower and 207 pound -feet of torque it\\'s all -wheel drive so that\\'s \\nwhat\\'s under the hood but what do you get with the key standard features the cooper s countryman \\nbase model comes with an 8.8 inch full color screen 6 -way manual front sport seats side bolsters and \\nthigh extension 3 spoke leather steering wheel led headlights dual exhaust tailpipes 18 -inch wheels all \\nfour all -wheel drive dynamic stability control and cruise control there\\'s some buttons here it looks kind \\nof like bmw\\'s idrive what do we have to put it in we\\'ve got to put it in s for subscribe and if you can

description below no andrea we\\'re going to \\n\\ntalk a little bit about reliability but we have two sets of friends that are mini diehards people that own \\nthese they love them and they keep coming back for more do they ever love them we have friends who \\nhave traded it in got a new one others have purcha sed it they\\'ve crammed into a two -door with a family \\nof four and they keep coming back for more they just don\\'t care about reliability they just think it\\'s such \\na great looking vehicle yeah so the one set of friends they had a cooper for 12 years both daug hters \\nlearned to drive on them they used them when they went to school and so so on and they just traded it \\nin recently and got this exact car the country means so they went to the biggest of the minis yeah \\nsomething a little bit bigger for them it is grea t for a family of four in here there\\'s plenty of space i mean \\nit\\'s really the x1 platform so reliability is an issue i mean you\\'re not going to get the same kind of \\nreliability you get with a lexus definitely let\\'s just be honest here but i call it the pai n pleasure matrix so \\ndoes this vehicle give you enough pleasure with the driving dynamics the fun factor the sporty engine to \\nput up with some misery having to take it back to the dealer once in a while are you willing to put up \\nwith that to have this car yeah i think a lot of people are for sure i mean our friends who have this mini \\ncountryman also own a range rover and they\\'re heading to the shop for that one too obviously there is \\nsomething to that zach for sure and this car obviously that kind of person ality obviously thanks to the \\ndriver they\\'re into the pain part maybe they\\'re the sadists maybe maybe there\\'s something to that i just \\nthink it\\'s a really kind of an exciting drive to it it has plenty of power it\\'s good so we\\'re just giving you \\nanecdotal i nformation on this you have to decide for yourself but there really isn\\'t anything on the road \\nthat has this combination no and this got a bit of a refresh nothing too exciting but it does have a little \\nbit more of a rugged look it has a bigger grill black  accents throughout and then it also has the cool \\nlooking taillights which is a bit of a nod to their british heritage well they call these typically facelifts i \\nwouldn\\'t call this a facelift i would call it maybe a botox injection with a little bit of wit h a few fillers it\\'s \\nnot really a phase lift right inside there\\'s a few changes as well now under the front row seat you get a \\nlittle bit more room for your feet so in the back you can really stretch out the back seat slides front and \\nback up to 13 centime ters and the cargo space has 450 liters of space in it so it\\'s a pretty good size this \\ncountry man so don\\'t think of this as a mini like a small car this is the fastest growing segment in the \\nauto industry the new small suv class so so many people buy the x1 it\\'s you know pound per pound \\ndollar for dollar it\\'s about the same right yeah but cooler cooler so we went through the key standard \\nfeatures and you might notice that something is missing a heated steering wheel is not available on any \\ntrim nor is andr oid auto no android auto are you kidding me it\\'s canada people we need a heated \\nsteering wheel apparently bmw mini are listening because uh heated steering wheel is being added for a \\nmodel year 2020. oh good stuff why would you take that out so you don\\'t g et a lot with the base model \\nbut one up from the base model it\\'s the classic trim and that\\'s where you get heated seats the \\npanoramic sunroof and the premiere one up from the classic you get keyless entry the automatic trunk \\nelectric front seats otherwise it\\'s manual and apple carplay you know what andrea bmw and mini they \\nwant you to part with your money a lot of those things honestly should be included in a premium brand \\ni think it\\'s kind of cheeky now the one thing i really dislike about this car is that  digital instrument cluster \\nlooks like somebody bought it on amazon for 49.99 just stuck it it\\'s just the cheapest crappiest looking \\ndigital instrument cluster you just think about what kia is offering in their cars oh unbelievable the \\nkoreans are offering  gorgeous digital instrument clusters they\\'re offering beautiful touch screens i think \\nwe both agree the interior needs some sort of a refresh but the exterior i think is good the way it is you \\nknow who needs a refresh zork time now for questions coffee an d cars your questions from instagram \\nlove the color by the way it\\'s sage green did you get a chance to drive the previous gen countryman s if \\nso do you see any big improvements that stick out in terms of performance and drivability um i don\\'t it\\'s \\nlike a m ini yeah it drives like a mini drives the same there\\'s just been a few tweaks mostly to the exterior \\nof this oh by the way this looks great to me um people because i\\'m colorblind people always ask what \\ndo you see i don\\'t see green in this at all no there\\'s  a little bit of a gray undertone but it\\'s green all i see \\nis all i see is gray this is one expensive mini how well does the infotainment function the center stack \\n\\nlooks crowded and the display screen looks small does it have a touch screen yes it has a touch screen \\noh they did make a point when they when i picked it up they said oh it\\'s got new soft touch buttons so \\nwhen you hit the buttons now oh stop that we don\\'t  want to we don\\'t want a copyright strike yeah \\nsomebody had it on chill that wasn\\'t you no i don\\'t like chill i am chill here\\'s the problem with mini in my \\nopinion they are handcuffed to this design you know whenever they have a new reveal at an auto show \\ni don\\'t need to go and look because they know exactly what it\\'s going to look like it\\'s going to look like a \\nmini yeah and then on the inside it\\'s got this big you know retro inspired dial in the middle i don\\'t love it \\ni like it but i think as you said it\\' s hard to make a change when everybody expects a mini to look like this \\ni love the exterior but if you want a more modern interior i\\'m not sure a lot of mini buyers would love \\nthat maybe they like this retro lot so back to the question this is owned by bmw  you basically get the i \\ndrive functionality from bmw in that so that is good yes is there better value with the x1 or this many \\ncountrymen well the x one starts at just under forty thousand dollars but the thing is the base model \\ndoesn\\'t come with a lot s o you have to get the premium neither does this no no not the same with this \\nyou have to get the premium package which has the panoramic sunroof and the heated seats but i think \\nyou\\'re coming in at around the same price to be honest with you probably aroun d 45 46 000 so you get \\nmore power with the bmw but yes this has a different look and a different vibe the bmw is kind of plain \\nlooking this one is at least funky so you have to decide what you want go figure why there hasn\\'t been \\nan electric version of thi s yet so the mini does come with an electric version the regular cooper the right \\nregular cooper and it gets up to 177 kilometers of electric range the countryman does have a hybrid \\nversion up to 40 kilometers of electric range not a whole lot on either of  them but my bat is this \\ncountryman is going to be all over yeah just wait everything\\'s going to be electrified for sure and that\\'s it \\nfor us thanks for your questions all right if you want to get a question or follow along make sure you \\nfollow andrea\\'s in stagram it\\'s motormouth underscore andrea and because you hear the music lots of \\npictures at night time it\\'s night life [Music] no andrea i know you like to drive it and subscribe but i\\'m \\ngoing to put it i\\'m putting it inside oh my gosh it sounds pretty go od and your butt is very low to the \\nground yeah i mean it\\'s the most unsuv suv you can buy i like it though it\\'s so nimble quick fun what an \\nentertaining drive so if you are somebody that likes to have fun behind the wheel you\\'re like a nimble \\neasy to thro w around little package and um you don\\'t want to give up the driving dynamics of a car this \\nis about as close you\\'re going to get i think it\\'s terrific i\\'m really enjoying it it\\'s been fun and i would \\nactually be happy with this vehicle just because of the  drive the interior why do you do that to me i\\'m \\ngoing to put it on yours on max you know what he does to me sometimes he puts it on the ventilated \\ncooling and i\\'m like oh why is it so cold only on cold days he tries to trick me i don\\'t like it it sounds \\nreally good for 189 horsepower 207 pound -feet of torque you might not remember but many this is true \\nmini used to have cvts no oh crap hola they were not good oh my god so this is crisp you you don\\'t get \\npaddle shifters you have to slide it over and yeah an d do it manually in the center but i actually don\\'t \\nmind that it reminds me of driving like a regular manual sure but some people might miss the paddle \\nshifters but here\\'s the thing andrea for similar money do you want 228 horsepower or do you want 189 \\nin this well you know i always like more horsepower and torque of course can i introduce you to an uh \\nbmw x1 we can get you into this for low monthly payments yes i like the look of this better i kind of \\nagree with you this is just a real standout exterior on  the road it just has a cool vibe to it i take this now \\nin questions coffee and cars we reference the price of the x1 so how does this one compare for your \\nconsideration four categories and four vehicles for you to consider the obvious first competitor is the \\nbmw x1 with a turbocharged 2 -liter 4 -cylinder engine and an 8 -speed automatic transmission 228 \\nhorsepower and a starting price of just under 40 thousand dollars next up the audi q3 it comes with a 2 -\\nliter turbocharged 4 -cylinder engine and an 8 -speed a utomatic transmission it also has 228 horsepower \\nit runs on regular gas and has a starting price of 39 250 dollars the mercedes -benz gla has a 2 -liter \\nturbocharged four -cylinder engine also with an eight -speed automatic transmission 221 horsepower \\nand a st arting price of 42 and a half thousand dollars so the non -premium alternative we\\'ve gone with \\n\\nthe new mazda cx -30 turbo 2.5 liter turbo four -cylinder engine only a six -speed automatic transmission \\nhowever this has 250 horsepower and a starting price of just over 36 000 so there are four vehicles for \\nyou to consider so this does share components wit h bmw so let\\'s see how much this one costs the \\ncountryman cooper s base model is almost 36 thousand dollars the classic trim is just over thirty eight \\nthousand the premier 40 690 dollars and the premier plus forty three thousand three hundred and forty \\ndollars price has tested just over forty seven thousand when it comes to fuel economy the countryman \\ngets 10.4 liters per hundred kilometers in the city 7.5 on the highway that\\'s 23 miles per gallon city and \\n31 miles per gallon highway now andrea we talked ab out how fun this thing is to drive but it does come \\nwith some downside it\\'s not quiet no and it\\'s a bit bumpy and a bit bumpy yeah so you have to like that i \\ndo like a bumpy ride as we know i do and it\\'s nice to hear it doing something right yes i think th ere\\'s \\nsomething about it it\\'s kind of special i would be happy with one i don\\'t know if you would be i would \\nlike it as a second car yeah i really love the drive of the countrymen but they could work on the \\npackaging a little bit the price goes up pretty f ast and they\\'re handcuffed by this design how do they \\nmove out of this shape how do they move away from this interior it\\'s going to be interesting to see what \\nthey do in the years to come this video is

is in the description below  \\n \\nCar Model : 2021 Mini Countryman  \\nReview : so some of you all remember a while back i did a video where i compared the bmw x1 to the \\nmini countryman and i said why i felt the countryman was far superior to the x1 well i didn\\'t compare it \\nto the x2 yet so i figured it\\'d only fair that i actually get  my hands on an x2 so that i could do this video \\nand baron bmw was kind enough even though i\\'m going to be very critical of their car to let me use one \\nof their bmw x2s so there it is there\\'s the countryman in question and this is a comparison of the bmw \\nx2 to the mini countryman [Music] so it seems only fitting that i would park the x2 in the shadows of the \\ncountrymen as i find the countryman far superior but i figured it only appropriate that i actually get \\nthese two together to show you all why the count ryman is still better than the bmw counterpart now \\nboth of these vehicles ride on the uk l2 platform they are both front -wheel drive biased all -wheel drive \\nsystems whereas the bmw is using the x drive system while mini is using the all four system they are  \\nbasically the same drive system yet as i\\'ve stated these two cars cannot be any more different and the \\nreason why is the way they are engineered bmw touts themselves as being the ultimate driving machine \\nmini doesn\\'t do that but these two vehicles are bas ically the same car is the x2 better than the \\ncountryman or is it the other way around so let\\'s start under the bonnet where these two cars are \\nvirtually identical this is the 2 -liter 4 -cylinder turbocharged b -46 motor in the mini countryman it puts \\nout 18 9 horsepower this is the same b46 2 -liter four -cylinder turbocharged motor except in the bmw \\nthis puts out 228 horsepower okay so the bmw already has a slight advantage over the countryman the \\nengine bays look virtually identical so when i say they are vir tually identical i mean that the air box is the \\nsame this strut brace is the same this brace right here is the same now why do i say that this is the bmw \\nand here we are in the countryman the same brace the same air box the same frame so it\\'s amazing \\nwith engineering and automobiles when they share platforms that parts on these cars are really quite \\nsimilar and can transfer over from vehicle to vehicle these engines are basically identical but why is the \\nbmw have more horsepower the reason for that is bmw o wners want more horsepower they don\\'t have \\nthe same horsepower as a mini so they bumped it up the 228 horsepower on this b46 is actually the \\nsame horsepower that\\'s on the john cooper works hard top as the john cooper works hard top from \\n2020 onward uses th e b46 engine now inside the cars they use the same transmission they both use an \\neight speed sport automatic however how they execute the interior fit and finish is of course quite \\n\\ndifferent so this is the interior of a 2021 mini countryman typical mini fare you have the nice black pearl \\ncloth interior you have the navigation system you have the eight speed automatic and you have a jcw \\nsteering wheel the new digital dash now as this is my first foray into a bmw let\\'s see what we have in \\nthe x2 you get in here we have very similar styled seats actually a little bit more bolstering on the sides \\nthan you\\'d get in the countryman same power seat functions in fact they\\'re pretty much identi cal now \\nof course you\\'re all saying that\\'s complete sacrilege how can the bmw be identical to the mini well \\nthey\\'re not obviously the styling of the seats is where it was similar the interior of the x2 is very very \\ndifferent for one this ipad looking scree n that pops up out of the dash okay we got a nice menu here we \\ngot navigation simple control panel no cd player much like the mini very similar i can see some buttons \\nthat look like they\\'re very similar to the other cars gauges are analog but this is a 201 8 model so \\nobviously it\\'s going to be slightly different back seats of course are going to be very different so we\\'re \\ngoing to get into the bmw first and uh notice their excessive use of the bmw badge there are four bmw \\nbadges on this car two on the sides and one on the front and back but anyway this is the back seat now \\nthe seat cushion looks similar to the countryman in a way but let\\'s see what it\\'s like to actually sit in this \\ncar okay so i\\'m now sitting in the back seat of the bmw x2 now it\\'s not bad al though the ceiling of this \\ncar if i sit upright is um [Music] maybe a couple of inches from my head and that\\'s a little claustrophobic \\nfor me so closing the door is not going to make it much better but it is very very tight back here i mean \\nit\\'s just it fe els very very tight i don\\'t know why other than the fact that\\'s the styling of this car it is very \\nvery tight back here and i don\\'t necessarily like that feeling on top of that look at that rear window now \\nthere is barely any visibility back there i mean b arely any visibility i mean that is a really small rear \\nwindow conversely climbing into the back seat of a mini countryman i have a lot more space there is at \\nleast four inches three or four inches of height between me and the roof of this car on top of th at look \\nat that rear window lots of visibility out there there is a lot of light coming through it\\'s a lot easier to see \\nthe whole interior of the mini feels very very open very very spacious which is kind of odd given that \\nthese two cars ride on the same platform and share the same mechanicals but the styling is of course \\nwhere things are completely different we\\'ve gone around the styling the only thing to do next really is \\nto drive the um bmw x2 so uh let\\'s do it so far so good now i can\\'t see the fuel ga uge down here so i \\nhaven\\'t i can\\'t even see my odometer really unless i tilt the steering wheel completely down into my lap \\nthen i can see it just fine but i want it right about there so if you have the steering wheel all the way up \\nyou\\'re not going to see  your odometer which is something the mini doesn\\'t have an issue with we\\'re \\ngoing to take it on a quick loop around onto i -35 okay lane keep assist that\\'s rather nice not that i need \\nlane keep assist and onto the highway we go not too enamored with the bli nd spots at the back corners \\nbut my mirrors are adjusted just so and i don\\'t think i have an issue there turn that off even in sport \\nmode the acceleration feels very slow now in the countryman when you put the car in sport mode it \\nactually adjusts the thro ttle response and the throttle response makes it more quick and this doesn\\'t \\nseem to be doing that now i apologize for the light flare in the corner that\\'s because of where the \\ncamera is mounted that was the only place i could actually mount the camera in this car as it\\'s a little bit \\nlower profile it makes it a little bit difficult still can\\'t see my odometer down there we\\'re going to hop \\noff onto antioch road so far my overall impressions are it drives fairly decent for a bmw it doesn\\'t feel \\nlike a mini o bviously but it does drive nicely now it\\'s still not one of my favorite models but it\\'s not bad \\nwe\\'re back off the highway we\\'re on a main city street it\\'s kind of smooth very comfortable just as \\ncompliant as the countryman would be feels about the same re ally although the bumps are a little bit \\nsmoother it\\'s really strange i\\'m not a fan of all bmws but i am a fan of some bmws i don\\'t know how i \\nfeel about the x2 i really don\\'t know how i feel about this car because it\\'s just different given the fact \\nthat i t\\'s almost too many to be a bmw and what i mean by that is this car is so much a mini that it \\nalmost isn\\'t a bmw it is a mini cooper countryman in bmw clothes which is really interesting and it is \\nsomething that bmw people have said about the two series gr and coupe is the fact that it feels very \\nmuch it feels very much like a mini and not so much like a bmw now i closed the sunroof because we \\n\\nwere getting some glare in here and it wasn\\'t very comfortable it\\'s not bad but the steering does feel a \\nlittle bit more numb compared to the countryman the countryman it feels very responsive even though \\nit\\'s a similar electric style steering the x2 not s o much now we\\'re going to get on to this last leg of the \\nmiriam loop to go back to the dealership and do something that i normally do with my countrymen and i \\ndon\\'t feel nearly as confident going around these corners in the bmw than i do in the mini that r eally did \\nnot feel pleasant to me that felt very nerve -wracking i don\\'t know why and what\\'s funny is this car has a \\nslightly lower center of gravity and the fact that it has a shorter height in its body it sits shorter than the \\ncountryman so the fact that it feels less planted than the countryman is really saying a lot that was \\ndefinitely an interesting feeling to go around that corner in a car that\\'s built on the same platform and \\nnot feel like you\\'re in total control the steering feels very responsive in sport mode but it also feels very \\nelectric it doesn\\'t feel necessarily like it\\'s actually connected to anything i know i know it\\'s actually \\nconnected but it just feels very very different compared to the mini so basically what exactly is the bmw \\nx2 this is  bmw\\'s version basically of the countryman even though the countryman was basically built by \\nbmw so it\\'s kind of an interesting scenario i think this is the car that was created because there were \\nbmw customers that liked the countryman but didn\\'t want to drive a mini and i\\'ve encountered this \\nbefore that there are bmw people out there who despise minis for some strange reason so they had to \\ncreate this car to cater to those who liked driving the countrymen but didn\\'t want to drive the \\ncountrymen so they cr eated the x2 it\\'s a very nice vehicle it\\'s definitely not as boring as the x1 is but is it \\nas fun to drive as the mini countryman yes and no styling is a little bit different the drive feels about the \\nsame although the steering doesn\\'t quite feel as precis e as the countryman does which is really strange \\nthis has more horsepower you can also get a lot of horsepower in the countryman if you go for the john \\ncooper works variant which is basically the same as the x2 m35i i think the mini is still far more fun t o \\ndrive but i\\'m gonna have to say this it\\'s pretty darn close between the two cars i mean the x2 definitely \\nfeels about the same as a mini countryman aside from a few details and the countryman feels very \\nmuch like the x2 in a way as far as how it drives t he styling is obviously different the engines are the \\nsame the drivetrains are the same it\\'s basically the same car but in a way it\\'s not and i feel like there\\'s \\nsomething special about the x2 i think that if many had wanted to they could take the x2 styli ng make it \\nmore mini cooper and you would have the mini paceman this could basically be a mini paceman if you \\nmade it a two door and kept this low slung roof so in conclusion here i have this mini countryman and i \\nhave this x2 around me what did i think of  the x2 when compared to the countryman well great car \\noverall very nice very very nice it\\'s still very fun to drive however my money is still on the countryman \\nbecause i still think the countryman\\'s a better vehicle i still think it\\'s more fun to drive an d i just can\\'t \\nwrap my head around the fact that they put four badges on a bmw and the fact that the head room in \\nthe back is so cramped effectively they are siblings or maybe cousins we could go either way which one \\nwould you pick if you had to pick betwe en these two cars i\\'m asking you this because my opinion is \\nobvious that i\\'d go with the mini and that\\'s a very biased opinion but there are those of you out there \\nwho would go with the x2 i hope you enjoyed this video if you did leave a like below don\\'t f orget to \\ncomment subscribe to the channel if you haven\\'t already done so and as always before i let you go i\\'m \\njust gonna remind you that life is too short to drive a boring car so well you know exactly what i\\'m \\ngonna say drive a mini absolutely drive a mi ni

the countryman well great car \\noverall very nice very very nice it\\'s still very fun to drive however my money is still on the countryman \\nbecause i still think the countryman\\'s a bet ter vehicle i still think it\\'s more fun to drive and i just can\\'t \\nwrap my head around the fact that they put four badges on a bmw and the fact that the head room in \\nthe back is so cramped effectively they are siblings or maybe cousins we could go either wa y which one \\nwould you pick if you had to pick between these two cars i\\'m asking you this because my opinion is \\nobvious that i\\'d go with the mini and that\\'s a very biased opinion but there are those of you out there \\nwho would go with the x2 i hope you enjoy ed this video if you did leave a like below don\\'t forget to \\ncomment subscribe to the channel if you haven\\'t already done so and as always before i let you go i\\'m \\njust gonna remind you that life is too short to drive a boring car so well you know exactly wh at i\\'m \\ngonna say drive a mini absolutely drive a mini i\\'ll see you on the next video [Music] you  \\n \\n \\nCar Model : 2021 Mini Countryman  \\nReview : hey guys and welcome to petrol ped now imagine you\\'re in the market for a small to medium -\\nsized family car maybe you\\'ve had a mini in the past and you\\'re after that go -kart feel but you need a \\nlittle bit more practicality so the obvious question is mini clubman or maybe mini countryman now \\nbehind me is my 2019 mini clubman jcw and thanks to mini uk i\\'ve got the latest 2021 countryman jcw \\nso i thought it would be really interesting to compare and  contrast these two cars in a number of very \\nimportant criteria okay first up let\\'s consider looks and size and i know this bit\\'s very subjective [Music] \\nnow i know styling is very subjective and we all have our preferences so i\\'ll keep this bit reasonably  \\nshort i really like what they\\'ve done on this facelift of the countrymen they\\'ve improved it in lots and \\nlots of areas and i think this car looks an awful lot better than the outgoing model obvious difference is \\nthere\\'s no bonnet scoop on the countryman w here it there is one on the clubman even though that\\'s a \\nfake unless you open it up like i\\'ve done on mine wheels -wise many of you will know i\\'ve changed the \\nwheels on this car to ozed racing wheels but originally it had the same wheels that the countryman  is \\nrunning and i really like those lovely diamond cut wheels they look really really smart and then the only \\nthing i\\'d probably change on this from a styling point of view as you can tell i\\'m a big stripes fan so i put \\nsome red bonnet stripes and maybe si de stripes and i think this car would look absolutely perfect for me \\nbut the most important comparison i think between these two is going to be size and weight and my \\ninitial thoughts would be this is going to be a significantly bigger car it certainly loo ks bigger but it\\'s not \\nactually that much bigger both cars are about 4.3 meters long and about 1.8 meters wide but the \\ncountryman is only 33 millimeters longer and 22 millimeters wider so it\\'s actually not the footprint of \\nthe car isn\\'t that much bigger th e difference however is height you can probably see it from there but \\nthis car is 116 millimeters higher than the clubman so that\\'s going to raise the center of gravity and \\ncertainly affect things like the handling when we\\'re out on the road and then final ly both cars are in the \\nregion of 1600 kilos this is 1625 kilos and 1675 kilos so only 50 kilos difference between the two and i \\nfound that really interesting so the rest of it the styling you guys make your own mind up which one you \\nprefer but from a size  point of view actually there isn\\'t a great deal in it just checking to see if i can fit \\nsome flaps now there\\'s a very good chance you\\'re going to want someone sat in the back of one of \\nthese so what\\'s the rear passenger leg room and general comfort like y ou know what it\\'s not bad there\\'s \\n\\nnot masses of room in here but i am a very tall six foot three with a 34 inch inside leg so i\\'ve got very \\nlong legs and this seat is as far back as it\\'s meant to go so leg room is is okay could be better however \\nwhat is really good in here is lots and lots  of headroom this higher raised ceiling height or raised roof \\nline just gives a bigger more airy feeling here not bad so i wonder how that compares to the clubman all \\nright oh hold on a minute this isn\\'t happening no i\\'m not getting in there and this seat is in my driver\\'s \\nposition so exactly the same position my legs haven\\'t shrunk or grown or anything it\\'s the same it\\'s very \\nvery limited i wonder if i could hold on maybe if i put my leg in differently to start with it there all splits \\nout no that\\'s not ha ppening so i think it\\'s safe to say the countryman wins that one by a countryman \\nmile now then family car means practical and carrying stuff around boot space the all -important boot \\nspace what\\'s the difference [Music] now firstly when we\\'re talking boot sp ace there\\'s a very big \\ndifference between these two cars one has a traditional tailgate and the clubman has the barn doors \\nnow you either love them or hate them we\\'ll get to that in a minute let\\'s talk about the countryman first \\naha an eager volunteer yes we need to talk about dogs first of all now before anybody asks darcy is \\ninside she\\'s been to the vet this morning she\\'s feeling very sorry for herself nothing too majorly serious \\nbut she\\'s certainly not feeling the love for the camera right now but you al ways are aren\\'t you mate so \\nyeah perfect amounts of room for the dogs it is a slightly raised car so it\\'s maybe a little bit more \\ndifficult getting stuff in and out but the big question is can you fit a bike in the boot without taking the \\nwheel off what do  you reckon dude you wanna get a bike so i need a bike bear with me pass the shelf \\nout and a little bit of fast music still got my turbo tire on apologies for that it\\'s coming off this weekend \\nnow then can we no not quite long enough however if i took the front wheel off that would be okay for \\nme i would also probably struggle the saddle is a little bit tall so it\\'s not quite big enough to get a bike of \\nmy size in but that\\'s fine because i put bikes either on the roof or for 200 quid you can get bike prep a t \\nthe back of this car to allow you to put a tow bar mounted uh rack on for normal bikes or you could get \\none that\\'s suitable for an e -bike so not quite big enough this doesn\\'t bode well for the clubman but we\\'ll \\ngive it a go anyway right let\\'s just put th is on the ground here or up against this wall let\\'s go and have a \\nlook at the club now then i\\'ll tell you straight away that the size of this boot is clearly much smaller than \\nthe countryman but the aperture is also smaller so getting big stuff in and out you\\'re going to struggle a \\nlittle bit more you can drop the seats now a couple of interesting things we\\'ve actually got a boot liner \\nin the car because we carry the dogs in the back and that\\'s one of the reasons i love this car so much is \\nit\\'s just so easy  when you\\'ve got a couple of dogs if we\\'re going to the beach we stick them in the back \\nwe\\'ve got the ball wanger in here and it just means it doesn\\'t ming up the boot you can take the liner \\nout or hoover it\\'s it\\'s just so easy to keep clean if you have bi gger dogs you might want to fit a dog cage \\nor you know a dog guard so it is much much more practical than a standard mini but not nearly as \\npractical as the countryman and i\\'m not going to try and get my bike in the back because i tell you for \\nnow i have t o take both wheels off and it\\'s a real tight squeeze so when i\\'m transporting my bike in this i \\nuse a roof mounted bike carrier now one of the things that you probably need to make sure you either \\nspec or look for if you\\'re going to buy one of these are th e roof rails you can\\'t retro fit the roof rails so if \\nyou\\'re thinking about carrying a roof mounted bike rack or a roof box you\\'ve got to make sure you spec \\nthe roof rails there is no difference in width between these two cars in roof rails so in terms of what you \\ncan put on the roof so my roof box is quite wide so i can either carry a roof box or i can carry two bikes if \\nyou had a narrower roof box you might be able to carry kind of on half you could carry the roof box and \\non the other half you could carry  a bike so if we\\'re going away for i know one or two weeks normally \\nwe\\'ll put the roof box on the roof and that just gives us that extra amount of stowage space so for \\neveryday use plenty of room if you want to go away for a longer trip or if you\\'ve got ki ds in the back and \\na family you might find that this even the clubman being a little bit more practical isn\\'t quite practical \\nenough and you might need to then go and have a roof box on but they\\'re super easy to fit the mini roof \\nbars look really smart and  then you can fit any kind of accessories onto the top of those next up for the \\ndriver anyway the really important bit driving position and general driver creature comforts yes a very \\n\\nfamiliar place i love the driving position of this car but in comparison to the countryman the most \\nimportant thing probably to state is the fact that you sit much lower down in the car and you kind of \\nthat envelops you into the car and for me it gives you  a far more engaging driving experience now i\\'ve \\ngot the 2019 model so i\\'ve got the analog clocks in front of me and i if you watch my countryman review \\nalready i really don\\'t like the new electronic display i would much rather have the analog clocks howev er \\nwhat i do like in the countrymen is the way that they\\'ve upgraded the central nav screen so when you\\'re \\nusing apple carplay it\\'s now full screen instead of two thirds screen which totally does my heading \\neverything else in here very very similar it\\'s ju st a little bit you you sat in lower you feel a bit more \\nenveloped in the car and for me that makes you more engaged in the drive but let\\'s head on over to the \\ncountryman and have a look at that now then instantly sat higher up no great surprise there but the \\nroof line or roof height is higher but the just general cabin position is much higher up the road you have \\na much more elevated driving position which i know many people like what that does do though is it just \\ndisengages you from the car a little bit you feel sat on it rather than in it everything else in here \\nmentioned the tft screen in front of me don\\'t like that but i do like the swoop of the dash um it just has \\na i know a very different feel but i like it a lot and i like the red accents and the ki nd of piano black work \\nit\\'s a really nice cabin now in terms of driver room clearly we\\'ve talked about the clubman having \\nslightly less room for a passenger in the back but in terms of driving there is plenty of room for the \\ndriver i\\'ve got actually probab ly a little bit of travel left in the seat if i wanted to go back a little bit \\nfurther there\\'s plenty of adjustment to the steering wheel you can kind of move it up and down and in \\nand out so you can get a nice driving position but yeah not bad for me thou gh i\\'d have the clubman \\ndriving position just because you feel sat far far more into the car and it just for me makes the driving \\nexperience that little bit better now then it\\'s time to take these two cars out on the road so the first \\nthing i want to consi der is ride quality [Music] now i must say the ride quality in this countryman is \\nexcellent grown up and mature is how i described it in my review but i think that is the best way to \\ndescribe it it\\'s actually quite unmini -like minis have a tendency to be q uite firm in the suspension \\nespecially the jcw variants and this car really isn\\'t like that actually it\\'s a pleasure on a b road even when \\nthe road surface isn\\'t all that good now in terms of ride quality my car is hampered a little bit because of \\nthe upgr ade i did to wheels and tires so the countryman was running on 19 -inch rims but two two five \\nforty -five profile tyres i\\'m still running 19 -inch rims on this but the clubman has two four five thirty \\nprofile tires much much smaller profile and what that mean s is a much much firmer ride um and it\\'s \\nbeen quite a while since i\\'ve driven a clubman that isn\\'t mine that has normal tyres but from what i \\nremember the ride did feel a little bit more firm than the countryman so ride quality wise i\\'d probably \\ngive it to  the countryman now then i\\'ve got the two sporty versions of the clubman and countryman \\nbehind me the jcw it\\'s a very important question is what\\'s the noise like now i am cheating a little bit \\nhere with my car because i have a remus race exhaust on my car which does sound really good but it \\nwill be very interesting to compare a stock jcw exhaust on the countryman with a remus race exhaust on \\nthe clubman [Music] now what about noise well when you used to buy a jcw back in the day they were \\nknown for uh burbl es and pops and crackles on overrun i remember when i bought my little roadster it \\npopped a lot don\\'t expect it when you buy one of these so this countryman\\'s just running the standard \\njcw exhaust and honestly i haven\\'t heard a pop or a splutter or anythin g like that since i\\'ve had it in fact \\neven at startup it sounds like this once you\\'re on the road however if i just drop it into sport box and \\naccelerate away a little bit that piped in noise sounds just like my car but it really doesn\\'t deliver the \\naudito ry drama and pleasure that i\\'d like but that\\'s just the world we live in today manufacturers just \\ncannot make cars sound as good as they used to now noise wise i\\'m sorry but there\\'s no comparison \\nand i am i guess playing unfair it\\'s like taking a machine g un to a knife fight this remus exhaust really \\ndoes sound nice when the car starts and it\\'s stationary rev it sounds like this [Music] so yeah loads more \\nburbles and popples and cracks now you don\\'t get so many of those when you\\'re driving if you come \\ninto a corner and you change down from maybe third to second you will get some pops on overrun but \\n\\nnot as bad as something like my roadster which is frankly ridiculous so if you want that extra \\nengagement you\\'d get from the noise then for me getting an opf back exhaust upgrade is something \\nwell worth doing because you\\'re just not going to get that from a stock exhaust as i\\'ve mentioned \\nalready these are the performance variants of both cars same engine same drivetrain 306 horsepower \\n450 newton meters of torque whopping great big brembo brakes on the front so it would be rude not to \\ndo a naught to 60 and back down to north test side by side [Music] [Music] three [Music] and finally for \\nme these two cars are all about driving enjoyment and driving engagement so let\\'s find a decent bit of b \\nroad and give them both a good spanking [Music] driving enjoyment th ere\\'s only one place gear stick to \\nthe left manual gear change petrol pedal climb [Music] oh complete hero going up the hill i\\'m gonna \\nhave to slow down for him oh man now let\\'s resume shall we [Music] see now it really shouldn\\'t be able \\nto do that it\\'s ac tually pretty competent in the corners it\\'s got a bit of body roll but so much traction and \\nthe gearbox and the drivetrain just feel so familiar to me so similar to the clubman but it\\'s got the go \\nand the pool to overcome that extra 50 kilos actually in th e corners it\\'s a really really exciting really \\nengaging car to drive and even the higher driving position doesn\\'t really give you too much of a penalty \\nand it still has the mini go -kart feel and i really don\\'t understand how the steering\\'s nice and it\\'s no t \\nquite as twitchy and quite as direct as some of the minis but it\\'s not bad not bad for a car of this size and \\nthis weight driving enjoyment in the countryman is pretty good now i\\'ve driven up this hill many many \\ntimes in my car so i know what\\'s about to happen i still love doing it into second and then give it some \\nbeans now there\\'s a couple of things working in favor of this car a lower center of gravity 50 kilos less \\nweight lower profile tires better tires i\\'m running michelin pilot sport 4s tires perha ps the best tires \\nthere are instead of the p0s that are on the countryman [Music] and this car\\'s just well it\\'s just brilliant \\noh god i love my car so yes um it\\'s it\\'s probably an obvious thing to state but the clubman performs \\nbetter on a road like that t han the countryman and to me in terms of driving enjoyment it therefore \\ndelivers a higher level of driving enjoyment it doesn\\'t mean to say however that it\\'s not fun driving the \\ncountrymen but the clubman it\\'s lighter it\\'s lower and it just drives better i \\'m afraid to say so if pure \\ndriving enjoyment is your deciding factor there\\'s only one choice it\\'s got to be the club so there you go \\nhopefully you found that an interesting comparison road test side by side to be honest i love both of \\nthese cars my clubma n is perhaps the best car i\\'ve ever owned i love her to bits in every way brilliant \\nperformance really good practicality and i like the looks as well and i know it\\'s not a mini it\\'s quite a big \\ncar but i really do love the clubman so when the countryman ca me along and it is a significantly bigger \\ncar and a different segment as well but so many of the underpinnings are the same i knew that the \\nperformance the straight line performance anyway is going to be very very similar you\\'d spot the \\ndifference on a sto pwatch but when you\\'re driving the car they\\'re very very similar it\\'s very difficult to \\nfeel the difference in speed between the two but what i wasn\\'t expecting with the countryman was that \\njust the dynamics of the driving experience it belies its size it\\' s super nimble it goes through the corners \\nreally well it doesn\\'t wallow and roll like you think it would and actually it delivers that that that mini go -\\nkart like feel driving experience however it\\'s got that extra bit of practicality a little bit more pa ssenger \\nroom a bigger boot the ability to carry more stuff and that makes it for me a really interesting \\nproposition if you just have that little you know bigger family a couple of kids more stuff to carry around \\nif i was buying one and i had a choice betw een the two i\\'ll be honest with you i\\'d still take the clubman \\nevery time however the countryman really really interesting anyway i hope you enjoyed that one i\\'d \\nlove to know which one you choose put it in the comments below but if you enjoyed that one ple ase \\ngive me a thumbs up comments below are always welcome and if you haven\\'t done so already please \\nsubscribe to petroped for plenty more content to come i want to say a massive thank you to minnie uk \\nfor letting me play with the countryman for the last we ek it\\'s been a really great experience i\\'m so glad i \\nfinally got one on the channel but that\\'s it for me i hope you enjoyed it i\\'ll see on the next film you take \\ncare drive safe foreign  \\n \\n\\n \\nCar Model : 2021 Mini Countryman  \\nReview : [Music] this behind me is the 2021 mini cooper countryman all 4 s and today i\\'m going to \\nreview it for you show you everything you need to know about it and how does it compare against the \\ncompetitors such as the audi q3 the bmw x1 as well which is technic ally engineers under the bmw \\numbrella today we\\'re going to talk about what does it offer we\\'re going to take it for a test drive i\\'m \\ngoing to talk about how this thing handles on the road and what kind of tech features and if it\\'s actually \\nworth ov er the competitors the mini cooper is quite a quirky vehicle it offers quite a lot of interesting \\nfeatures and it has its own unique design especially on the outside and it follows the same thing on the \\ninterior the beautiful thing is that you got a couple  of options to choose from in terms of trims and \\nengines there are two engines you have a three cylinder and a four cylinder there are four country man \\nmodels to choose from starting with the base which it is a turbo three cylinder cooper all four that sta rts \\nthe 32 000 canadian moving up to the turbo 4s and topping out with the plug -in hybrid sc all4 which it is \\nat 44 000 doors you also have the high performance jcw all four at 43 000. the model we have for \\ntoday\\'s video with the premiere plus package it i s more than forty seven thousand dollars and that is of \\ncourse in canadian you have three trims to choose from you have the classic which starts at twenty one \\nhundred dollars canadian you have the premiere at forty seven hundred dollars and the premiere pl us \\nwhich is the one we have today\\'s video at 7 300 canadian some of the features of the classics like the \\nled headlights a panoramic sunroof keyless ignition and heated front seats the premiere adds power \\nadjustable front seats you get dual zone automatic climate control gps and a navigation a power liftgate \\napple carplay and more you also get a premium audio system with a premiere plus and a heads -up \\ndisplay and of course the navigation system with the real -time traffic information and an eight -point \\ninch collar touchscreen with a full digital instrument cluster this model that you see in here of course \\nhas a bit more performance looking not the same as the jcw the hood it\\'s sort of more performance \\ndriven you have the center area the front area the same th ing with the grill and the bottom part as well \\nso overall this is actually quite a good looking vehicle i\\'ll say it all comes down to taste of course and \\neveryone has a different opinion about it but i think this package it\\'s actually quite interesting the  way \\nthey\\'ve put them together from the actual grill the side profile and so on now how does it compare to \\nthe bmw x1 and the audi q3 the q3 technically looks smaller than this it actually looks more like a \\nsportback the x1 feels almost the same in terms o f the size the difference is that in here this has more of \\na boxy style and a bit of a curved area in the front but i do like the overall exterior it makes it feel unique \\nand very different from let\\'s say the bmw or the audi q3 this is much more different than any vehicle out \\nthere on the road and that\\'s what i love about the mini cooper now let\\'s talk about the rear end first of \\nall that signature design on the front continues all the way to the back with the special tail light union \\njack style tail lights  and you have the countryman blacked out badge at the back a very unique design to \\nthis and with this package you get a single exhaust on each side that gives you that rumble noise which i \\nlike it especially when you put in sport mode you get a bit more of  that it makes it more interesting tech \\nfeatures what do we have led tail lights most importantly you do get a backup camera as well and with \\nyour key fob in your pocket this little cute key fob that i absolutely love you can slide your foot under \\nand bang  on it would open the tailgate so you have a hands -free tailgate option with this premiere plus \\nand of course through the key fob and most importantly you have the buttons over here the first thing \\nyou recognize with this these buttons the fact that they\\'r e technically bmw buttons and very familiar \\nnow let\\'s talk about underneath you got more space under here most importantly you can add more \\nstuff so you got quite a lot of cargo room for the size of this vehicle in terms of the cargo space you get \\nabout 17 .6 cubic feet of space in total with the plug -in hybrids you don\\'t get the same amount if you \\nfold the second row seeds it stretches all the way to 47.6 cubic feet of space and most importantly you \\nhave this cover here which you can open it and then put mo re stuff underneath so it\\'s not better than \\n\\nthe average just below the average on its own segment okay into the second row first of all i\\'m six two \\nso i\\'m average i\\'m taller than the average individual which means i should feel uncomfortable here and i \\ndon\\'t because it actually is comfortable inside  very spacious i have quite a lot of head room leg room is \\nstill comfortable the seat in the front is positioned away as if i was the driver so that way we make a fair \\nuh comparison to other models now compared to the q3 which i have reviewed this does fee l more \\nspacious inside and most importantly had room and in terms of visibility in the front too in terms of tech \\nfeatures we only got two usbc ports at the bottom vents but we have no heated seats in the back but \\nyou do get a full panoramic roof now it is  split in half so you get the one in the back which you can close \\nit manually with the actual filter and then we have one in the front the same thing it\\'s split in half so it\\'s \\nactually not full panoramic roof but both sides get a bit of a sunlight from he re you can\\'t open the back \\none but you can open the front sunroof it\\'s nice and comfortable inside beautiful leather interior i love \\nthis headrest they have that signature mini cooper this is what i love about the mini cooper it\\'s it\\'s \\ndifferent than any o ther vehicle that you review in most vehicles you get in you get to see the same kind \\nof steering wheel maybe the infrastructure display is a bit different but this is like completely different \\nfrom anything you\\'d see out there and it all comes down to whe ther you like it or not because the \\ndesign overall whether it\\'s inside or outside it\\'s slightly different compared to an average subcompact \\nsuv okay let\\'s talk about the mini cooper first of all the interior it is quite interesting how different this \\nthing  is inside compared to any standard vehicle for that matter so i\\'ve reviewed q3s i\\'ve reviewed the \\nbmw x1 they\\'re very different but also similar at the same time the mini cooper has a complete different \\ndesign from all of them and that\\'s what i love about  this so let\\'s start first with the actual the heads -up \\ndisplay it\\'s like a fighter jet style i love that because it just pops out it\\'s hidden inside the actual \\ninstrument cluster in here the digital cluster it is attached to the steering column so every t ime you \\nmove the steering column it actually moves with the cluster as well very different the actual \\ninfotainment display here is of course touch screen you have a backup camera as well you have apple \\ncar play but you don\\'t get any android auto from the d ocument that i was given this packed out this is \\nthe premiere plus which technology is the higher trim it is not available with this package you only have \\none usb port the other problem as well the actual center console has the armrest underneath has the \\nwireless charging pad my phone is apple a iphone 12 pro max it can\\'t fit in there it\\'s too big even with \\nthe case out taken off it\\'s still too big for the phone the actual case itself it\\'s not big enough and that is \\nthe problem now the next thing that i fin d interesting with this vehicle is the area here you see it\\'s like \\nthe signature of mini cooper the circle here it changes light uh it changes the light itself based on \\ndifferent color it also changes based on the driving modes as well which is very unique  to the mini \\ncooper for this specific area like i understand most vehicles have interior lighting this has a uniqueness \\nin there the whole design inside in my opinion is so different from any vehicle out there it\\'s it\\'s unique \\nto the mini cooper some thing s that i like about this the sitting position it\\'s nice some things that i don\\'t \\nlike about it the space for the driver in the front someone that is six to i don\\'t feel as comfortable here \\ndo i feel as comfortable in the q3 not really so it\\'s not bad in te rms of space here leg room it is spacious \\nas a driver you get to enjoy a lot of the space inside here but it someone that is 6 -2 the lag room it\\'s not \\nthe best and if i move further back the passenger in the back won\\'t have more space unless it is \\nsomeone that is shorter than i in terms of the steering here i love this area i love the steering wheel \\neverything is right in front of me they\\'re not too far you have the heads -up display the cluster right in \\nthe center i can see clearly they have made the cluste r big enough so you can see that it doesn\\'t bother \\nthe steering wheel because you have this center area the points at the top for grip they don\\'t impede \\nthe visibility off the digital cluster the actual sunroof you can open in the front it has a sunshade a s well \\nand most importantly you can open the sunroof completely let\\'s talk about the noise inside how quiet \\ndoes it feel is it quieter than the audi a3 is it quite on the audi q3 and the bmw x1 um now really i do \\nhear a bit of the wind noise in here and i do hear the cars passing by but if you are two people inside \\nyou can have a decent conversation or have to raise your voice um it\\'s still very very well isolated i \\n\\nwould say it\\'s not the best in the market but it\\'s definitely isolated inside and you can have a decent \\nconversation with the passenger even if you have two people in the back visibility that\\'s the next \\nquestion it\\'s pretty wide in the back and the third w indow as well you have a third window which is \\nmassive gives you great visibility of the door on my right side same way with this package this doesn\\'t \\noffer any blind spot assist that\\'s something that it\\'s weird like every car has it i\\'m not sure why they \\ndidn\\'t offer with the premium plus it could be potentially maybe offered as an extra charge that could \\nbe the reason because i don\\'t see any blind spot assist in this area and no 360 camera with the premier \\nplus for that price it\\'s a bit expensive i must s ay it\\'s a very um it\\'s a bit expensive compared to the audi \\nq3 which could offer a little bit more than that and on top of that we don\\'t even get ventilated seats in \\nhere so that\\'s the disappointing part with this vehicle now let\\'s talk about the power del ivery let\\'s put in \\nsport mode [Music] you have two options when it comes to driving modes you have the sports and the \\ngreen the power delivery it\\'s nice but it\\'s not the most exciting out there i think if you want some power \\nyou want to go with the jcw tha t could make the experience definitely far better in terms of driver \\nassistant package we have gap assist you have cruise control advanced cruise control as well um we also \\nhave lean assist with this package and as you can see from the button here we have the pedestrian \\nwarning front uh frontal collision warning as well there\\'s some safety features let\\'s turn on the cruise \\ncontrol it\\'s not actively steering for you to keep you within the lanes but it\\'s making sure that you don\\'t \\nbounce left and right when y ou turn the signal it switches of course off so that way you\\'re able to move \\ninto the middle lane or the lane that you want to merge overall the mini cooper is is great but i feel a bit \\npricey but then you have the fans that love a vehicle like this that i s different from any other sub \\ncompact suvs i think it\\'s a great vehicle for the what it offers but i the price is something that i\\'m not \\n100 convinced with this car overall it looks nice it has a bit of a power you can enjoy the driving in here \\nyou can dr ive the driving experience but i think overall just a bit pricey other than that the vehicle is still \\nstill where it should be in terms of competition and it comes down to taste in my opinion whether you \\nlike this kind of design or not i\\'m i\\'m a big fan of  this vehicle i love the the smaller version i don\\'t like the \\ncountryman as much but i love the mini cooper the standard mini cooper it\\'s a fun vehicle to drive and a \\nlot of fun this is the same but if that was me i would definitely go for the jcw because i love a bit of \\npower and love a bit of that performance looking style for the vehicle overall this it\\'s still well capable \\ngreat on the road comfortable ride suspension system changes a bit from eco mode green mode to \\nsport mode uh it\\'s not as stiff it is  comfortable overall it doesn\\'t have a boat ride but it it\\'s still very \\nenjoyable overall overall i think the vehicle it\\'s a good choice but i think it just slightly overpriced \\ncompared to other vehicles like the q3 and the x1 even the volvo for that matte r stay safe cheers  \\n \\nCar Model : 2021 Mini Countryman  \\nReview : this is the mini five -door look it\\'s got rear door more practical version of the normal mini \\nhatchback and mini has made some changes to this car recently so they\\'ve tweaked the look slightly \\nthey\\'ve rated the suspension a bit they\\'ve done some changes to the engine i\\'m going to talk you \\nthrough all the changes and upgrades and tell you what this car is like to drive and to live with in this \\nvideo i\\'m matt watson and you\\'re watching car wow buying a new car then head to car wow and my \\nteam will help  you find your next car at a fair price car wow your one stop car buying comparison site \\nlet\\'s start this video by talking about the price so the mini five door starts from just over 17 000 pounds \\nso you can save an average of just over 2 000 pounds of one  through car wow now if you want to see \\nhow much money you can have a new car click on the pop out button up there just popping out the top \\nright hand corner of the screen you can go directly to car wow alternatively after this video you can just \\nsimply go ogle help me car wow my team and i help you choose the right car for you and get it for a fair \\nprice from one of our trusted dealers right let\\'s talk about the design because that\\'s what the mini is all \\n\\nabout it\\'s a very designed some might say over designed car it\\'s got a new rear bumper design \\ncompared to the previous version that\\'s what they\\'re going to look like this is the cooper s so it means \\nit\\'s got performance engine in it but you can also get an  even higher performance car the john cooper \\nworks and two lower power versions the cooper and then the slowest version which is the one but then \\nyou can make them look different depending on if you have the classic trim the sport trim or the \\nexclusive tri m this is the sport trim and so you get this diffuser which is fake as are these vents here \\nwhat i do like is the rear fog light it\\'s a little led strip used to be round lights and the sunlight feature this \\ncar very recognizable union jack style tail lamps  and a sporty roof spoiler which looks a little bit over \\ndesigned as well here at the side the five -door version of the mini just doesn\\'t look quite as cool as the \\nthree -door it\\'s just a bit elongated to make space for these rear doors a bit more rear pass enger space \\nwe\\'ll get to that in a moment now some of the changes they made here at the side slightly different real \\narch cladding did you spot that you probably didn\\'t they\\'ve also changed the alloy world designs as well \\nthis has the john cooper works 18 inch alloys though as standard the car starts off with 16 inches those \\nlook like they\\'d be very easy to curb it\\'s a distinctive car from the side and this is quite distinctive as well \\nthis piece of plastic this stuck on there i\\'m not just sure about that h ere at the front the car\\'s got a \\nredesigned grille there\\'s quite a lot going on here vents there that are real then some that aren\\'t and \\nthat one definitely isn\\'t now i used to have a mark one new bmw mini if that makes sense which had a \\nsupercharger on it  and that vent actually fed air into the engine bay not now in fact the whole car\\'s \\ngrown in size and i used to love the look of the mini but i\\'m liking it less and less but what do you think \\nlet me know in the comments below what you think of the styling of this mini i think it\\'s definitely a love \\nit or loathe it kind of car now i think the exterior design of the mini has got worse as it\\'s moved through \\nthe generations i think the interior design has improved i really do like the interior it\\'s quirky it\\'s very \\nwell made feels solid you would not mistake this car for anything else this big central screen here which \\nincidentally they\\'ve updated the screen made it bigger they\\'ve improved the infotainment system as \\nwell so it\\'s just easier to navigate and use a nd it\\'s all very very simple you can get a digital driver\\'s \\ndisplay as well the steering wheel feels nice though it is rather fat comparing my hands around it but it\\'s \\ngot good quality feel to it the driving position is pretty nice there\\'s lots of adjustme nt in the steering \\nwheel i also like the fact you can get the seat quite low in this car which helps with the sporty feel now if \\nyou\\'re tall you might find headroom a little bit tight but if you\\'re short you\\'ll be thankful that you can \\njack the seat up qui te a long way so you can sort of get a view out over that bonnet in terms of \\npracticality i\\'ll just look at this here with me the glove box is actually a good size you\\'ve got a couple of \\ncupholders there but then if you have a normal sized bottle it\\'s fine  however you have a bigger bottle \\nwell it\\'ll fit in there then you get in the way of your buttons then that\\'s where your stop start button is in \\nyour sport mode button down there and you\\'re going to want to put a bigger bottle in there because \\nthere\\'s no w ay that\\'s fitting the door bin this is not as practical as something like a volkswagen polo and \\nif you\\'d like to see my four independent review of a volkswagen polo if you click on the pop -up banner \\nup there you can watch that video i\\'ll tell you what thou gh i do like these sports seats which come as \\npart of the sports pack they hold you firmly in place quite a lot of the design as well now the main \\nreason you\\'re buying the five -door version of the mini rather than the three -door is because it\\'s more \\npracti cal because you\\'ve got these rear doors however as small cars with rear doors go it\\'s one of the \\nleast practical for instance these doors don\\'t open all that it\\'s difficult to get if you\\'re an adult kids will \\nbe fine once you\\'re back here knee room isn\\'t t oo bad actually look the car in the seat does help foot \\nspace is a little bit cramped headroom\\'s tight i\\'m sitting up straight and i\\'ve got about that much room \\nso liveable if you\\'re over six foot you will just about be able to coat back here technically y ou could carry \\nthree people in the back there\\'s a third seat belt but there is this big thing in the center it\\'s actually a \\ncup holder you can easily fit that but i think everyone has to fight over this cupholder maybe you just fill \\nit with water or someth ing just fill it with water there we go and then people can dip a straw in and \\ndrink out of that anyway let\\'s continue so if you have to carry through in the back at once this is no fun \\n\\nat all it\\'s tantamount to torture really i\\'ve got that at my bottom and about that much space to sit my \\nbuttocks on look at that i\\'ve got a small bottom and even i don\\'t fit on there oh dear another thing that\\'s \\na bit awkward let\\'s fit in a chance in the b ack of here because they haven\\'t got that much room to \\nmaneuver it\\'s hard to get the seat in thankfully though there are easy access ice fix anchor points and \\nyou\\'ve got lift up covers so you\\'re not going to lose those so it\\'s not all bad news another bene fit of the \\nfive-door version of the mini over the three -door is that it has a slightly bigger boot bigger by 67 litres so \\nnow you have 278 liters of space which is still a little bit on the small side for instance a peugeot 208 \\nboot capacity is 311 liters and if you want to see my full in -depth video review of that car click on the \\npop-up button up there you can go check out that video however this boot does have quite a lot of \\nfunctionality for instance check this out right you\\'ve got a false floor and you  can like store things under \\nthere if you want or if you need to carry taller items in the boot you can just prop that bit up like that \\nand then have suitcases piled up suitcases one or two maybe hold up here in the boot and then when \\nyou fold the seats do wn you might be thinking oh my god look there\\'s a big ridge what happens if you \\nwant to slide something heavy to the front it\\'s going to be annoying well you can\\'t actually lift this up \\ni\\'m going to demonstrate it now with perfect ease come on come on look  at that almost seamlessly but \\nthere you go look then you have a continuous floor and you can just slide things out of the back of the \\ncar quite easily as well you\\'ve got some tie down hooks there and there\\'s a 12 volt socket but there\\'s \\nsomething i\\'ve not iced it\\'s a bit frustrating and that\\'s the fact that this bumper does protrude quite \\naway so you end up leaning on it and if it\\'s dirty like this it seems to catch the dirt the design of it you \\nend up with very dirty trousers that brings on to five or nine  things about this mini depending on where \\nthe sun is you can get terrible glare off these dars so you can hardly read them and look at this look as \\npart of the navigation plus pack you get wireless charging the only problem is that it doesn\\'t fit larger \\nphones such as my galaxy s20 ultra and if your phone does fit as soon as it\\'s enclosed and while it\\'s \\ncharging it can then overheat and switch off media\\'s fitted this car with a petrol particulate filter as part \\nof the update the only problem is is that on this cooper s version which is supposed to be sporty it\\'s \\nreduced the power by 13 horsepower compared to the previous version this armrest gets in the way of \\nthe manual handbrake so when you put it on you know you have to fold this out of the way and yeah \\nthere we go got the brake on now and then when i want to leave i have to pull that down and then fold \\nthat down like that there we go that\\'s annoying as well this dual sunroof is a 700 pound option \\nannoyingly though it\\'s manually operated no problem here i n the front but if you want to stop some \\nglare coming in from the back it\\'s hard to do that when you\\'re driving thankfully this car has plenty of \\ncool features to help make up for all this here\\'s five you get the car with interior ambient lighting and if \\nyou want to switch to colors you don\\'t have to mess around by going through menus in the \\ninfotainment system in the button there you just press it and you can cycle through all the different \\ncolors it does sport models of this car come with a new type of da mper when you hit a sudden jolt the \\ndamper opens up a valve to let it move more freely so you don\\'t get that shot going through to the \\ncabin like you would have done on a standard damper now you can get that system as an option on \\nother trim versions of th e mini there are various wired charging options depending on how old you are \\nwhich is kind of important considering mini it\\'s quite a wide range of customer for instance for the old \\nvogue is there\\'s a 12 volt socket there for mid laser you\\'ve got the norma l usb for the youngsters there\\'s \\nusbc and like with some other manufacturers the car gets a contrasting roof as standard though if you\\'d \\nrather have it the same as the rest of the body you can do optionally you can now get the car with a tri -\\ncolor roof and  the way it\\'s sprayed means that each one is completely unique check it out look we\\'ve \\ngot our car play without having to connect a wire if only there\\'s android auto then it\\'d be perfect it\\'s not \\nthere now let\\'s talk about the engines so it\\'s quite simple there\\'s three to choose from so there\\'s the \\nmini one it has a three cylinder 1.5 litre turbo petrol with 102 horsepower then there\\'s the cooper \\nwhich has the same engine but it\\'s tuned up to 136 horsepower then there\\'s this cooper s version which \\nhas a two  liter four -cylinder turbo petrol with 178 horsepower all cars are front -wheel drive but you can \\n\\nhave a choice of either a manual or an automatic gearbox now let\\'s see what this mini is like to drive \\nstarting off with what it\\'s like in town because it\\'s relatively small it\\'s quite decent for nipping through \\ngaps in traffic and the responsive steering means that you can change direction pretty quickly what\\'s \\nnot so good though is this big blind spot you get here in fact the view out is limited compared to other \\nsmaller cars it\\'s just the way that the windscreen is quite shallow and the back window isn\\'t  the largest \\nit\\'s all to do with the character of the car you sit quite low in it and that means that you see quite a lot \\nof dash in front of you rather than road it\\'s not a problem though what can be is a suspension the \\nchanges made to the suspension have  made it a bit better than it was before but you still do feel the \\nbumps way more than you\\'re doing something like an audi a1 in fact if you want to see my fort index \\nvideo review of that car put a link popping down the top right corner of the screen click  on that you can \\nwatch that video if you want to it\\'s not terrible though and it is slightly improved after they\\'ve made the \\nrecent changes to the car one thing you might want to think about though is the wheel size because the \\nsmaller wheels you have the better the comfort will be the only problem is smaller wheels don\\'t look as \\ngood and the reason you bought a mini is for the looks right it\\'s the whole reason to have this car it\\'s the \\nquirky styling another reason to have the car is driver enjoyment in th at respect i will go for the manual \\ngearbox because it is very nice to use this is the automatic and actually to live with every day it is easier \\nespecially for when you\\'re just mooching around in town or in traffic because you don\\'t have to faff \\naround wi th a clutch or changing gears however what\\'s this car like when you get out onto the open \\nroad well what i\\'m going to do is show how well this gearbox kicks down when you\\'re driving a long in \\nsports mode and you floor it it\\'s a little bit slow but then it\\' s off and here we go 70 miles an hour so this \\ntwo liter engine it picks up all right it makes a bit of a noise when you\\'re revving it out listen not sure \\nthat\\'s a good noise like it\\'s not enjoying it so much and it doesn\\'t really rev out hard at the end of  the \\nrev range either it\\'s all a bit lethargic at the top end a bit of a shame really because that\\'s the whole \\npoint of having the keeper is the performance anyway i\\'ll come back to the performance in a moment \\nbecause i will launch this car to see how quic k it is for not 60 miles an hour but what i want to tell you \\nabout is the main problem with this car for longer journeys and it\\'s the noise you get from the tyres this \\ncar is so noisy when you\\'re cruising along at 70 miles an hour once again the bigger the  wheels the more \\nnoise you get however none of this matters does it because you\\'ve bought a mini for that go -kart \\nhandling for the fun factor and it does have a dirty feel to it once it sets up in the corner this guy doesn\\'t \\nleave much at all in the benz i t stays nice and flat but it\\'s just not quite as much fun as you think it might \\nbe in fact if you want a fun handling small car get a ford fiesta handle\\'s better than this i don\\'t think this \\ncar is particularly bad at handling it\\'s more that it\\'s getting o n a bit now and other cars just do a better \\njob of it i think this is more of a car that you buy for its looks rather than how it drives it\\'s all about the \\nshow less about the go speaking of which let\\'s launch this car so it does not 6d mini says his keepe r s \\nversion should do naught to 60 in 6.8 seconds for the automatic gearbox 6.9 for the manual to launch \\nhere you have to have the stability control in sports mode the gearbox in sport therefore on the brake \\nfloor the throttle launch control active it\\'s ho lding the res at one and a half thousand rpm i don\\'t know \\nthis is gonna be good anyway let\\'s go oh did our eye on the traction there what\\'s the naught to 60 what \\nare we gonna get two six click in the middle says am i brave enough to do the standing quarter  mile \\ncome on clock it up running out of road running that road i\\'m gonna have to break now got it 14.71 oh \\nmy god i don\\'t know if you saw that seven one oh my god when i was breaking this car was just all over \\nthe place just moving around wasn\\'t stable on  the brakes at all it was quite frightening oh dear idea \\nmaybe that\\'s how he does have go -kart handling because that\\'s what little go -karts do [Music] so then \\nwhat\\'s my final verdict on the mini five -door should you avoid it should you consider it should y ou \\nshortlist it or should you just go right ahead and buy it well i reckon you should consider the mini five -\\ndoor it\\'s the kind of car that you\\'re either gonna like the look of or not and either gonna wanna buy it or \\nnot and it\\'s quirky it\\'s just that it\\'s  also very compromised hey if you enjoyed the video please give it a \\nlike also let me know if any other videos you\\'d

underrated \\nelectric cars on sale in australia now and i think that because it takes on challenges that other electric \\ncars don\\'t it doesn\\'t brag about its range it does n\\'t brag about its sustainability or how many recycled \\nmaterials it uses this car focuses on driving and that makes it quite unique in the ev world now you can \\nread our full written review over at carsguy.com dot a u and it\\'s on our ev guide site section w here we \\nanswer all of your ev questions that you might have so let\\'s get into it first things first pricings and specs \\nnow it\\'s impossible to talk about pricing and specs for electric cars without also talking about range and \\nwell on that front the mini is  not exactly good value you see it\\'ll only travel just over 200 kilometers on a \\nsingle charge which isn\\'t great by any measure but many would argue that\\'s not the point and i\\'m \\nactually inclined to agree with them let\\'s look at why wearing a before on -road s price tag which starts in \\nthe region of 55 000 and tops out at well over 60k for the limited resolute edition we\\'re driving for this \\nvideo the cooper se is competing on price with cars like the base tesla model 3 pulsed r2 and even the \\nnissan leaf all of  which have significantly more range for the same money even combustion hot hatches \\nare significantly cheaper in this price range while its driving range is very limited for what you\\'re paying \\nit\\'s worth remembering that minis are generally in the realm of  premium pricing anyway and will attract \\na customer seeking a niche experience the equipment list is relatively healthy for a mini with the electric \\nversion being based off the high spec s trim from the combustion range you\\'ll get standard equipment \\nlike s ynthetic leather seat trim an 8.8 inch multimedia touchscreen with wireless apple carplay \\nconnectivity as well as built -in sat -nav and a wireless phone charger a 5.5 inch semi -digital instrument \\ncluster led headlights 17 -inch alloy wheels and dual zone cli mate which feels a little overkill for such a \\nsmall cabin of course a key part of the mini experience is customization and this is more what its range \\nof variants allow all share the same motor range and battery specs but the base classic variant makes do \\nwith more limited trim choices while the more expensive mid -grade yours and limited edition resolute \\nwhich we tested for this review allow a more diverse set of color and interior trim options now what can \\nwe say about design when it comes to minis it\\'s no t as though the brand has revolutionized things year \\non year although the one we have here is in a special edition resolute trim which means you get the \\nsignature green color and the white roof which i love because every other brand does contrast roofs in \\nblack let\\'s take a closer look i will say though the mini is aging well at least on the outside it\\'s almost \\ntimeless and classic looks betray its age and it\\'s been brought up to date with a few tweaks here and \\nthere particularly in those led headlight clus ters and more contemporary wheel choices now you might \\nhave seen mini electrics with the kind of like three prong plug design wheels and yeah they\\'re kind of \\nfun and over the top electric -y but i kind of like it when the cooper sticks to the formula and th ese are \\nmy favorite wheels that the car comes with these are called the tentacle wheel and they\\'ve got the little \\naccents in there to remind you that it is the electric version which i love inside is less of a good story \\nwhile there\\'s certainly an element of this car hiding its age with the caricatured style it\\'s easy to tell \\nfrom its dated multimedia offering and somewhat simple digital dash that it\\'s not the latest offering on \\nthe market there are a few bits of older bmw switch gear in the interior too fr om the touch based \\nindicators to the shift stick but it\\'s still a funky space to be in which ultimately is the goal interestingly \\nand even from the outside there is next to nothing to indicate the cooper is electric which i actually \\nthink helps it rather t han hinters it as customers aren\\'t faced with having to stick with a particular \\n\\naesthetic as they might have to be with versions of the hyundai kona or mgzs which are electric alright \\npracticality does anybody buy a mini for practicality i really hope not because well just have a look at the \\nboot i don\\'t have our signature cars guide luggage set but you can probably see straight away there that \\nthere\\'s just not much boot to work with so what\\'s it like in the cabin well if you\\'ve never driven a mini \\nbefore i\\'ll show you okay up front it\\'s kooky because it\\'s a mini there\\'s just a lot goi ng on there\\'s a \\nmassive center dial thing which will be familiar if you\\'ve been in any mini before but currently it houses \\na multimedia screen and it\\'s got kind of clunky old bmw software which isn\\'t the best to use it\\'s still a \\ntouch screen but you can op erate it with a little center dial as well so there are kind of multiple ways \\nyou can go about that i like the steering wheel and i like the funky little digital dash fitting in here which \\nboth has a digital piece to it but also it has like an actual analo g dial that shows you how much energy \\nyou\\'re putting down and your regen as well it\\'s kind of quaint i like it if you\\'re any taller than me it\\'s \\ngoing to feel a bit squashed in here too so it\\'s worth keeping that in mind and these seats while they \\nlook rea lly cool they\\'re manual adjust which is a bit of a tall order for a car that costs this much money \\nokay this doesn\\'t look good i know what you\\'re thinking and to be honest with you it wasn\\'t graceful to \\nget in here either but actually i\\'m impressed that i fit it all because minnie said one of the things that \\nthey changed when they made this car electric was that actually raised this rear bench up a little bit to \\nfacilitate batteries underneath so the fact that my head isn\\'t touching the roof and the fact th at if i slot \\nmy feet in i can actually sit behind my own driving position it\\'s not as bad as you think it\\'s going to be to \\nsum up them this little car is mini by name and many by nature preferring to stick to its stylistic roots \\nthen try and change things to make it bigger on the inside no matter which trim level you pick the mini \\nelectric is powered by a single 135 kilowatt 270 newton meter electric motor which drives the front \\nwheels it doesn\\'t sound like much but it\\'s a punchy little thing in a small car  which helps the electric mini \\nlive up to that cooper s promise sold by its exterior in fact it will still sprint from zero to 100 kilometers \\nin 7.3 seconds which while not necessarily impressive for an electric car isn\\'t too shabby by warm hatch \\nstandards  okay let\\'s cover off our range charging and our battery so the mini cooper electric has a \\nbattery which is a smidge over 30 kilowatt hours and that\\'s not a whole lot it only grants the car a range \\nof just over 200 kilometers and that\\'s not great either bu t again that\\'s not the point of the car having a \\nbattery so small keeps it really light so that\\'s really neat and also having a battery this small means that \\nyou can charge it up really quickly so on a dc charger at 50 kilowatts you can charge it up in jus t over 30 \\nminutes but importantly on an ac charger and this is where this car really comes into its own it has what \\ni would consider an over spec ac charger so it charges at a rate of 11 kilowatts on on one of those plugs \\nand that means that you can charge  it up in just over two and a half hours from virtually nothing on an \\nac plug that\\'s a grocery shop\\'s worth of charging to get a full charge a small advantage of having a small \\nbattery and mini could have easily given this car a 7.2 kilowatt charger which still wouldn\\'t have been \\ntoo bad considering the battery size or worse still a 3.6 kilowatt hour charger which is what many \\nbrands with cars batteries this size do so i\\'m really impressed with that that\\'s probably one of the \\nheadline specs for this car the  fact you can charge it so fast on ac it makes charging really convenient \\njust a quick word on kilowatt hours to 100 kilometers that new energy efficiency standards many would \\nargue that the battery pack is relatively light and therefore allows the car to maintain its signature \\ndriving experience look if that\\'s true in a moment but its electric consumption is rated at 17.5 kilowatt \\nhours to 100 kilometers now while that consumption number doesn\\'t sound amazing for such a small \\ncar i achieved a much more rea sonable number of 14 kilowatt hours to 100 kilometers in an earlier \\nweek -long test that\\'s not bad at all okay so all the specs and style in the world is great but for me the \\nreal selling point of the mini electric is the experience behind the wheel because  it really nails all of \\nthose mini cornerstones it\\'s light it\\'s connected it\\'s firm you feel everything that\\'s going on at the front \\nwheels at the road and that\\'s something that so few electric cars have tackled let alone nailed there\\'s \\nsomething about thi s car which makes it truly fun to drive and it\\'s one of the few cars that gives you a \\nbit more hope that the electric future can really be fun the power figures aren\\'t amazing but it is bloody \\n\\nquick when you put your foot down in sports mode it\\'s just a little bit unhinged how quickly that torque \\narrives and the same could actually be said for the regen the regen is actually really good in this car you \\ncan recoup a lot of energy by using it with  the only mild issue being that in the full regen mode it can be \\nquite abrupt when you let your foot off the accelerator it\\'s good because it\\'s saving you as much energy \\nas possible but it can just be a little stilted around town sometimes to give you an i dea of how this car \\ncompares to its rivals on the road take a look at the model 3 for example that car is firm like this mini is \\nbut it misses a little bit of that connection to the road because of its weird steering tune and it\\'s over \\ntechified interior a nd then there\\'s other electric cars like the mx -30 which is also a light electric car like \\nthis but you\\'re sitting too far off the ground to be as connected as this car feels in the corners again one \\nof the major downsides of this car is that multimedia su ite it is feeling a little old the nav has some \\ninteresting ideas about which direction you should go when you put an address in and the dial system \\nhere is cumbersome and like many old bmws which is where this system comes from there are just too \\nmany men us so it\\'s not the easiest system to use while you\\'re on the move i find myself wishing even \\nfor something like tesla\\'s massive touch screen as flawed as it is the little dash here though is clever and \\nquaint and it suits the character of the cast so well with that little analog dial flying up when you put \\nyour power power down and down when you put your regen down it it\\'s just it\\'s such a great little \\nfeature of this car that speaks to its character and look yes the ride is quite firm maybe too firm for \\nsome especially since it\\'s a car best suited to driving around cities and if you live in a major one in \\naustralia like sydney you\\'ll know how rough our roads can be so you might get batted about a little bit in \\nthis car but it\\'s not as bad as it could be esp ecially since it\\'s got quite a few lithium batteries under the \\nfloor and it weighs significantly more than the combustion version it leaves you with a funny conundrum \\nbecause this car is actually so much fun to drive on a curvy road you actually kind of wa nt to seek those \\nout you just have to hope that they\\'re within distance of your limited range and just a word on \\nadjustability because i do like an electric car where you can sort of change it around and customize it to \\nyour own driving preference and in t he mini you\\'ve got a little switch down on the dash here that \\nadjusts either a low regen setting mode which is quite unobtrusive um so if you\\'re more used to driving \\na combustion car maybe you\\'d like to use that mode or there\\'s a heavier regen mode and as i said \\nbefore that can be a little bit stilted if you set that to max so keep that in mind as well there\\'s also \\nmultiple driving modes there\\'s an efficiency mode uh called green plus which is quite handy to have \\nalthough you have to do without some of this  car\\'s luxuries if you put it in green plus mode it turns the \\naccelerator response all the way down and it even switches the air conditioning off so i think you\\'d \\nprobably need to be wanting to make the absolute most of this car\\'s range to have to use that  function \\nbut it\\'s nice that it has it despite its relative age the cooper comes with some of the key active safety \\nitems that we like to see on all cars read about them on our written review at carsguy.com but it is \\nworth noting this little hatch only has  a four star and cap safety rating on the one hand it achieved this \\nbefore it had been updated with some of these key safety items but on the other hand it is to a very old \\n2014 standard so who knows how it would perform in an up -to-date test mini sits und er the bmw \\numbrella a brand which is a famous laggard for its three -year warranty it covers unlimited kilometers \\nand does include roadside assist and the battery components are covered by a more industry standard \\neight year and 160 thousand kilometer warra nty but it would still be nice to see improvement here on \\nthe topic of servicing minis have condition based intervals which means the car will tell you when it\\'s \\ntime to visit a workshop service costs are interesting a basic pack covering six years costs j ust 1280 or \\nsmidge over 200 a year this includes filters fluids and checks meanwhile the much more expansive plus \\npack costs over four grand for the same six year period but it does include expendable items like brake \\npads and discs as well as things like windscreen wipers okay time for a verdict i think the mini cooper is \\nreally surprising it\\'s fun to drive it sells that mini promise it feels really lightweight and it takes on that \\nissue of drivability so well no other electric car is doing that this is ge nuinely a fun little car to drive most \\nof its drawbacks are the same as the rest of the cooper range that old multimedia system it\\'s tiny on the \\n\\ninside i mean it is a mini but all in all that\\'s not the electric car\\'s fault and this is probably the best \\nversion of the cooper you can buy it and as i said at the beginning possibly the most underrated electric \\ncar on sale in australia you  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 Mini Cooper SE  \\nReview:  today we\\'re going to review the 2023 Mini Cooper Electric the most disappointing car I\\'ve \\nreviewed so far in this channel here\\'s all the topics we\\'ll discuss in this video let\\'s get started okay let\\'s \\nget real here why the hell am I comparing a subc compac t to a midsize sedan here\\'s the kicker there\\'s \\nonly a $1,000 difference between the Mini Cooper Electric and the base model 3 like seriously I wouldn\\'t \\nblame you for clicking away right now are you gone but if you\\'re still here seriously drop a com ment on \\nwhy the would someone buy this mini all right so the wheelbase is attached shorter than the model 3 \\njust 15 in maybe that\\'s their excuse for a smaller battery this Mighty Mini Cooper Electric is equipped \\nwith a 32 KW battery pack granting it a laug hable 112 M of range do you grasp what2 Mi of range \\ntranslate to in cold weather it\\'s a measly 80 Mi of real world range factor in that these Mini Cooper \\nElectric comes in with lithiumion batteries that shouldn\\'t be charged Beyond 80% or so for daily drivi ng \\nyou\\'re left with about 64 M of range that\\'s barely enough to and from work and maybe you can run a \\nfew errands why subject yourself to such torture in contrast the model 3 bols a 60 Kow battery pack \\nalmost doubl that of the mini and delivers about 428 k m of driving range plus thanks to the lfp battery \\nyou can utilize the full 100% daily without battery degradation not just the 80% like the mini and with \\nthe cold weather that we get up here in Canada you\\'ll be able to get about 250 to 300 km of drivable \\nrange every single day the sole perk with the Mini Cooper Electric perhaps is basically the front wheeel \\ndrive while the base model 3 is a rear wheel drive sure the mini might have a little bit of better traction \\njust because it\\'s frm wheeel drive but the m odel 3 isn\\'t really slacking let\\'s remember we aren\\'t really \\nracing so this minor Edge doesn\\'t really make up for the mere $11,000 price drop in my book the Mini \\nCooper Electric retains the iconic and unmistakable mini design reminiscent of its predecessor s the car\\'s \\nfront Sports the signature round headlights synonymous with the Brand\\'s Timeless character however a \\nnotable departure from the classic Mini is the absence of the traditional Grill instead we have a Sleek \\nuninterrupted curve hinting at its elec tric nature taking a look at the back of the Mini Cooper Electric the \\nfirst thing that grabs your attention is the unique tail lights with the unmistakable Union Jack design \\nthen there\\'s the well -placed Cooper S Insignia hinting at the car sporty nature wi thout any exhaust pipes \\nit\\'s a clear reminder of its electric Sole and the solid bumper gives it a grounded sturdy look it\\'s clear \\nthat BMW track to make this mini blend in and have that classic charm with Modern Electric Vibes I just \\nwish they did a bette r job with pricing opening up the rear end of the Mini Cooper Electric surprisingly \\neven though the mini boasts a hatchback design its storage capacity is significantly smaller than the \\nmodel 3 it\\'s quite the contradiction considering hatchbacks are often louded for their versatility in cargo \\nmanagement with the mini it seems your trading off utility for that iconic design a choice po potential \\nbuyers especially here in North America should seriously contemplate I guess the second advantage of \\nthe mini is t hat you do get a mobile home charger you have a Nema 515 which is basically 120 volt \\nOutlet which you can use to plug in anywhere or you have the more powerful Nemo variant which can \\ncharge a little bit faster you do of course unless you\\'re in the UK you n eed to install a 240 volt Outlet in \\nyour garage again this included charger still does not excuse the price $1,000 difference this charger \\nonly cost about $315 Canadian dollar at the Tesla store also Tesla did provide mobile chargers \\npreviously with their cars but they decided to stop partly of course to reduce costs but they also saw in \\ntheir data that a lot of people weren\\'t using these mobile chargers personally I only need the j1772 plug \\nI don\\'t even use the mobile charger that came with the car and Tes la vehicles right now does not come \\nwith the mobile charger anymore but it does come in included with the j1772 plug which you can use to \\n\\nplug into any public Chargers and a lot of Manufacturers here in North America converting to NS \\nadapters this will not be an issue in the upcoming future stepping into the Mini Cooper Electric there\\'s \\nan uncanny sense of deja vu the interior is strikingly identical to its gasoline counterpart one might \\nexpect some distinction given its electric nature but it\\'s hard to discern any it feels like a Mist on \\nopportunity to truly differentiate and modernize the cabin for its electric era and I guess another \\nadvan tage of this mini is that it is a BMW after all the interior quality is much much better than the Tesla \\nI\\'ll show you guys the rear seats here I have no idea who would fit into those bucket seats maybe \\nsomeone can cramp in there for a short short drive or you can just put a child seat back there I don\\'t see \\na grown human being being fitting and being comfortable on those seats again I understand that the \\nmini is a mini car it\\'s a subcompact car but I only say this because it\\'s a $1,000 difference and the le g \\nspace in the model 3 is amazing I do understand that it\\'s a bit unfair comparing a sub compact car with a \\nsedan but Tesla doesn\\'t have a subc compact car yet and also the 1,000 price difference I feel like this is \\na quite fair comparison what do you guys  think let me know down in the comment section while while I \\nmay have reservations about the interior it\\'s undeniable that it appeals to a specific audience the Mini \\nCooper Electric presents a circular Centric design that\\'s distinctive and might resonate w ith purists for a \\ndedicated Mini Cooper Enthusiast the transition to this electric version might feel seamless given the \\nlack of drastic changes in the design language the start button here and the gear shifting knob is exactly \\nthe same with its gas counte rpart in the Mini Cooper Electric you of course have the premium Harmon \\nGarden speakers delivering a crisp and immersive audio but the Tesla Model 3 isn\\'t really lagging far \\nbehind in the sound Department its audio system although not branded provides a ri ch and clear \\nlistening experience making both cars feel quite competitive in terms of audio Tesla rather shelling out \\nthe big bucks for the Branded audio systems they made a strategic decision instead of Licensing they \\nredirected those funds to their engin eering team tasking them with crafting the highest quality in -house \\nsound system this decision not only speaks to Tesla\\'s Innovative Spirit but also their confidence in \\ndelivering a top tier audio experience without relying on external brand names if you h ave ever been on \\na Tesla yourself you know that their speaker and sound quality is not too far off from the name brands \\none other area and this is probably the last one where the Mini Cooper has a slight Advantage is that \\nthe turning radius as if it wasn\\'t  obvious is a little bit better than the model 3 the model 3 has a turning \\nradius of about 19 ft in contrast the Mini Cooper outshines with a tighter radius of about 17 ft the \\nadvantage in the turning radius might make the Mini Cooper Electric a viable cho ice for those in the UK \\nor other densely packed cities where tighter Maneuvers are essential but for the sprawling Urban \\nlandscape of North America the model 3\\'s 19 ft turning radius is more than sufficient it\\'s challenging to \\njustify choosing the mini esp ecially considering the mere $1,000 and that\\'s Canadian dollars price \\ndifference with the model 3 to my viewers in the UK or similar Urban settings does that twoot turning \\nradius Advantage truly make a significant difference for you I\\'m honestly genuinely curious when you \\ntalk 0 to 60 the Mini Cooper Electric clocks in at 6.5 seconds while the Tesla Model 3 beats it slightly at \\n6.1 seconds for the Zera 60 many Cooper is $1,000 Canadian dollar cheaper but you\\'re only sacrificing \\n0.4 seconds of the 0 to 60 bu t hey you have a better turning radius it comes included with home \\ncharging and a better interior quality speaking of 0 to 60 the Mini Cooper Electric has a neat little \\nfeature worth mentioning engage sports mode and watch as the center console and the amb ient \\nlighting immediately shift to an intense red Hue all right are you ready for the 0 to 60 here we [Music] \\ngo there is no denying that the Mini Cooper Electric is a fun to drive car its maneuverability arguably has \\nthe slight Edge over the model 3 at th e price point of $330,000 Canadian I genuinely believe manyi \\nwould see these cars flying off the Lots especially among urbanites who don\\'t really Venture on lengthy \\nroad trips like I do and predominantly navigate on city streets given that Tesla hasn\\'t tap ped into the \\nsub $330,000 market yet mini had a golden chance here they could have positioned the Cooper Electric \\nas a go -to option for those shopping in that price bracket mini had a clear window to capture a \\nsignificant market share but it feels like the y let that opportunity slip through their fingers that wraps up \\n\\nmy review for today I genuinely hope you found it insightful if you\\'ve stuck around till now chime in \\nbelow if I\\'ve overlooked something or if you\\'ve got reasons to justify the $52,000 Canadian price tag on \\nthe mini just a grand shy of the model 3 drop you r thoughts

hatch which means that it\\'s mini it also means \\nthat parking it no problem Lane waves just like this one not a hassle but just because it\\'s a small car \\ndoesn\\'t mean that it doesn\\'t have a big personality b ut with an electric motor instead of a petrol engine \\nis it still the true mini that we all know and maybe even love in this video we\\'re going to find out if this \\ncar is still iconically fun foreign the Mini Cooper Electric has been around for quite  some time now it\\'s \\navailable in two trim grades the mini yours and the Resolute this one is the Resolute Edition with this \\ntrim you get a bunch of additional nicenies including the Resolute Bonnet strikes mini yours leather \\nlounge and carbon black Resolut e Nappa leather steering wheel panoramic sunroof seat heating for the \\nfront row and Harman Kardon sound system to name a few this Mini Cooper EV will set you back 65 325 \\nplus on -road costs there\\'s an electric motor powering the front wheels via a one -speed  automatic \\ntransmission plus a 32.6 kilowatt hour lithium -ion battery generating maximum outputs of 135 kilowatts \\nand 270 newton meters the mini electric has a claimed driving range of 222 kilometers in the front of \\nthe mini and you\\'ll notice that that per sonality on the outside continues to the inside straight up one of \\nmy favorite things about the interior of this car is this right here are the circular infotainment system in \\nit houses an 8.8 inch touchscreen and it\\'s really cool because whenever you adju st the dials with your \\nheating or your cooling or your music track and change the volume it lights up in different colors around \\nthe outside then you\\'ve got the oblong digital instrument cluster which doesn\\'t have a whole heap of \\ninformation in there but i t\\'s actually really tidy really easy to use so some people might jump in this car \\nand think oh yeah okay it looks like a mini nothing\\'s changed maybe it\\'s aged a little bit yes they have \\nkept it quite the same but I actually still think it feels quite plus h and I\\'m going to use the word cute in \\nhere lots of circular fun features there are circular features on the door handles and around those \\nHarman Kardon speakers something else to note is these seats Nappa leather seats really comfortable \\nreally supportiv e you\\'ve got a leather steering wheel and I think the build quality in here is actually \\nreally good so all up here on the dash that\\'s actually really quite soft you don\\'t really see any hard \\nplastics until you go further down on the dash and on the doors i n terms of storage you\\'re in a hatch so \\nyes there\\'s not a heap of room but you\\'ve got more than enough to get the job done I can fit my large \\ndrink bottle in here so two cup holders and then you\\'ve got a little storage compartment down here \\nwhich does fill  up pretty quickly some storage here too because this is raised so you\\'ve got a nice Gap \\nthere for larger items and then funnily enough I don\\'t usually fit my phone in a mini this is a wireless \\ncharge pad and it is quite small so if you\\'ve got a larger pho ne that probably won\\'t work well for you but \\nI\\'ve got a newer smaller iPhone and it fits perfectly and charges that works this also does have wireless \\nApple carplay but doesn\\'t support Android auto you\\'ve got some really cute looking dials around here \\nyour  stop start button as well and they\\'ve stuck with some Shortcut features so they do get buttons you \\n\\ndo get dials which I\\'m really happy with because we see a lot of that coming out of new cars now and all \\nbeing thrown into the touch screen you\\'ve got your steering wheel controls and just like a BMW you\\'ve \\ngot your rotary dial here as well and plenty of s hortcuts so everything is really easy on the go the only \\nthing that I had to get used to with the changing your tracks on the steering wheel rather than just \\nclicking right or left you actually have to click down and then select your song so I end up turni ng my \\nmusic up really loud sometimes instead as a mistake but no problem with that this has a premium \\nHarman Kardon sound system so all in all it\\'s really lovely in here and you get a nice big summary of two \\nokay so getting into the back of the mini I can\\' t believe that I used to own a three door and used to have \\nto go through all of this but there you go you got your latch there so how easy is it to jump in that\\'s fine \\nplenty of room good door aperture I have to mention though those front seats while they\\' re heated \\nthey\\'re actually not electric so you\\'ve got a manual adjustment there I would have expected electric \\nseats for this price point all right in the back here I\\'m going to move that there okay so that would be my \\ndriving position I\\'m 173 centimeters so yeah it\\'s not really built for tallies I mean there\\'s not heap of leg \\nroom and toe room but the Headroom is pretty decent I don\\'t think this car is built for families you\\'re \\nnot going to use this as a family car they are isofix mounting points though if  you did want to use it as \\nthat and in the way of nice it is while you\\'ve got your summary for as I said you get a cup holder here \\none cup holder on either side you\\'ve got those speakers back here as well the seats are still really \\ncomfortable obviously yo u\\'re not getting that recline but as I said nipple leather seats lots of bolstering \\nand that that\\'s really all you get back here so yes you can fit two adults back here it gets the job done \\nbut it is still yes a very mini hatch now I just need to try and g et out so okay the latch and push does it all \\nin one motion so it\\'s pretty easy [Music] okay so let\\'s check out the boot no power tailgate when you \\nclose it that\\'s a really really loud alarming noise but anyway opening the boot and there\\'s 211 liters of \\ncargo space a little bit down on some of its competitors something like the Cooper born has 385 but you \\ndo get some underfloor storage here too which is really handy for a small car and that\\'s where you can \\npop your charging cable which comes with this mini now once you expand those seats because you can \\nfold down these rear seats that gives you 731 liters just do the luggage test my cool funky luggage \\ncoming on this review with me that one fits there perfectly but I\\'m going to fold down the seats and try \\nand fit both in which I\\'m sure we\\'ll be able to do thank you in you could easily probably fit two of those \\nin quite easily as well so there you have it Bang [Music] one of the first things that you\\'ll notice about \\nthis car when you\\'re behind the wheel and hav e to get used to is the music note that comes from this \\nmini because a lot of electric cars you\\'d think are completely silent but that isn\\'t the case with this card \\nhas like a bit of a jetsonsy noise it sounds like it\\'s ready to launch so certainly somethi ng that you need \\nto get used to but that\\'s not to be confused with cabin noise because it\\'s actually quite a silent cabin no \\ntire noise coming into this car which is good so other than the synthesized noise or the music that\\'s \\ncoming from that amazing Harm an Kardon sound system it is actually a really nice enjoyable silent tissue \\nDrive I think with electric cars a lot of the time they Venture quite far away from their petrol \\ncounterpart and they\\'re not as familiar so that can be a bit of a turn off for peop le but one thing that I\\'m \\nhappy to say with this mini is that it remains true to its roots so yes in the way of handling in that go -\\nkart feel this is still a true mini and still a lot of fun behind the wheel so yes it still has that mini handling \\nthe steer ing is a lot firmer something that I had to get a bit used on it love firmer steering and a firmer \\nride but it is a sporty cast that\\'s something that you can expect but the steering is really responsive ride \\nquality is great over those rougher surfaces it just Glides over speed humps so no complaints there one \\nof the great things about driving this car is that it feels quite plush I know that yes the minis interior it \\nhasn\\'t changed for quite some time people say that it\\'s aged but for me I have everything that I need \\neverything is really simple in a good way and easy to use on the Move including the infotainment system \\neverything connects really well and the seats are incredibly comfortable they\\'re a Napa leather very \\nsupportive and in the way of safety it does have a bunch of standard safety features adaptive cruise \\ncontrol works perfectly on the freeway it does however miss out on Lane keep assist and blind spot \\n\\nmonitoring which I think I would expect those features to come standard for this price point so let\\'s talk \\nabout the range of this car around 222 kilometers claimed which no that is not a lot when we talk about \\nelectric cars these days all the new cars are  coming out with closer to 400 there is a new version of this \\ncar coming that will be over 300K is closer to 400. so a real competitor of this car is probably the fee \\nwhich unfortunately yes has more range and is cheaper mini claims 15.2 to 17.6 kilowatt h ours I have \\ncertainly been over that at one stage or is it 19.2 right now I\\'m at 18.8 so it kind of depends how you\\'re \\ndriving it as well I\\'ve been in sport mode on occasions I haven\\'t been driving at all in green mode and I \\nhave had it in you can switch i t in between high energy and low energy depending on what sort of \\ndriving you like to do if you\\'re into the low pedal driving for me it\\'s a little bit intense so I have actually \\nkept it on low energy for most of my drives work for me is only around 15 K\\'s away so when I arrive I \\nprobably had it sitting no more than 120 kilometers really I haven\\'t gone to a DC fast charger and \\ncharger this week I\\'ve just been plugging it into the outlet at work so I\\'ll get to work at around 90 K\\'s and \\nthen over the seven eig ht hour period I\\'ll get around 30k so that has been plenty for me and that is \\nexactly the sort of driving that the buyer of a mini EB I believe is going to be doing so a second car or an \\nurban Runabout it works perfectly for that situation okay I found som ething else fun in the mini now \\nonce your car is in green mode you can play a game we\\'re calling it The Fish game James 40 Ward \\nactually introduced me to it and it essentially judges your driving there\\'s a little fish in a bowl and it \\njumps up when you get  another star you need to get to five stars and it\\'s based on your anticipation and \\nacceleration I\\'m just going to preface this by telling you all that James did not clock this game so we still \\ndon\\'t know what happens when you actually clock it I don\\'t kno w if Minnie send you a gift who knows \\nso let\\'s keep driving along and see if I can actually win this game [Music] [Music] okay I\\'ve been driving \\nfor around 10 minutes playing this game stuck on four stars I need to pull up soon and I think it actually \\nrebo ots when you turn off the car so obviously mini does not believe that James and I are fantastic \\ndrivers we don\\'t get the ticket approval but anyway if anyone knows how to clock this game please let \\nus know in the comments below foreign the Mini Cooper S EV  doesn\\'t remain loyal to its roots so I think \\nI\\'ve already answered that in saying that it looks like a mini it acts like a mini it is lots of fun to drive as \\nwell a few downfalls I\\'ve already mentioned in the range and yes it is a bit pricier but if those  don\\'t \\nmatter to you and you want to make a statement this might just be the car for you if you\\'re stepping \\ninto an electric vehicle if you want to know anything more about this car or anything mini be sure to \\nhead on over to drive.com today you and if you  want to see more videos just like this one be sure to \\nclick the Subscribe

when many decided to return to North American Shores with the all -new \\nCooper it instantly won the hearts of many American fans because it had all of the same character of \\nthe original Mini Cooper that left the us all those years ago now o f course with the industry continuing \\nto move toward electrification many cannot Escape that fate either which is why I\\'m standing by this \\n2023 Mini Cooper SE technically the company introduced his car back in 2020 but they have made some \\nchanges t o the vehicle since then which is why we are testing one out for a full week so we can put it \\nthrough our usual battery of tests but the big question I want to answer at the end of this video has \\nmany continued to capture all of the charm and Charisma of t he gas versions in the electric model stay \\ntuned to find out [Music] now before we start talking about the styling of the 2023 Mini Cooper Electric \\nlet me go ahead and pop the hood because the million dollar question with a lot of EVS does it have a \\nfront and as you can see the mini begins life as an internal combustion vehicle so it does not have a \\nfrunk instead we have a single electric motor powering the front wheels now underneath this big plastic \\n\\nshroud you\\'re going to find one electric motor like I said that gives this vehicle front wheel drive it\\'s \\nessentially a motor that was taken out of the old BMW I3 the number is pretty impressive in terms of \\npower for just one electric motor 181 horsepower and 199 pound -feet of torque those output figures \\nbasically match the gas powered Mini Cooper S which is why this is called the Mini Cooper S E the E \\nbeing it stands for electric and this vehicle also has a 32.6 kilowatt hour lithium -ion battery pack that \\nlines the floor that essentially will give it up to 114 miles of Eva only range it all goes out through a one \\nspeed reduction Gear transmission and mini says that this vehicle should get to 60 in around 6.9 \\nseconds we\\'ll test it out with our equipment and this vehicle has a top speed of around 190 or I\\'m sorry \\njust 93 miles an hour not 193 miles an hour so just under 100 miles an hour that\\'s technically govern \\nlimited and compared to the gas powered mini this is about 200 pounds heavier but it\\'s still among  the \\nlightest ever for an electric vehicle at just over 3 200 pounds but let\\'s go ahead and close the hood \\nwhich I love by the way how the headlights stay in place and it goes kind of over the hood now unlike \\nthe 2020 model that I showed you guys last time  for the Cooper SE many gave this car the updated front \\nfascia a couple years ago that they introduced on the gas powered mini you can see the signature \\ncircular bug eye headlights are apparent I don\\'t like however how there\\'s still this fake hood scoop he re \\nbecause again this is not an internal combustion vehicle we have the updated front end with the larger \\nGrille with this kind of bar that is now body color that was in introduced on the pre on the refresh model \\nyou can see full LED headlights are standar d on all the Cooper SES I like the Halo LED daytime running \\nlight and turn signal LED low and high beams no fog lights on this vehicle you do have some functional \\nair vents there that allow air to pass through along with more functional vents at the front which again \\nnot really necessary for this vehicle you can\\'t really tell from this angle that this is the electric model \\nthere\\'s just a yellow s badge here that\\'s going to let you know that this is the electric version now \\nlooking around the side profile yo u can see the Cooper SE only comes as the hatchback two -door mini \\nalso makes a four -door they also make a convertible sadly you can\\'t get the electric version to any of \\nthose other body styles they only offer it in this there are rumors of them offering a convertible version \\nof this but that has not been confirmed by many uh just yet now looking at the overall proportions at \\nthe side this is among the smallest vehicles that you can buy at 151.7 inches long it\\'s about an inch \\nshorter than the gas model surpr isingly I wasn\\'t expecting that it has like a 98 inch long wheelbase and \\nthen minis offer several different choices of Wheels the base Wheels 16 inch wheel this is the 17 inch \\nSparkle Sparkle Silver tentacle wheel not my favorite in terms of a wheel design  they also offer a black \\nfinish on it and other different black wheels you can also see there are these unpainted wheel arches \\nover there along with the unpainted side skirt you have an S badge over here with an LED daytime or \\nLED turn signal over here yel low painted side mirrors which goes really nicely with the yellow cloth and \\nleather red seats you can see my tester also has a black roof which you can also get a white roof or a \\nmulti -colored roof it also has an opening panoramic glass sunroof as well whi ch is nice some more \\nChrome along the Belt Line and overall this car is certainly distinctive I just think this particular spec \\ndoesn\\'t speak to me I would probably get this car in British racing green with black wheels and a black \\nroof just make it look a  little bit more aggressive a little bit more masculine the rear I never really \\nwarmed up to the rear end styling of this third generation Cooper when it came out in 2013 it\\'s just got \\nthese huge tail lights I don\\'t like how big they are they are an LED de sign you can see the British flag is \\nkind of Incorporated in the actual tail light modules with more Chrome and then you can see here this is \\nthe electric badge along with the yellow Cooper S badge and then obviously being the electric model \\nthere\\'s no vis ible exhaust tips you\\'re not going to need that when you have it on an electric vehicle now \\nopening up the trunk area the two -door is very small in terms of the cargo space you only get around \\n8.7 cubic feet of space you can see it probably just has enough  room for my 21 inch roller bag and a \\nbackpack underneath here however there is a pretty deep underfloor storage area you can see these \\nare the Chargers and the box for the Cooper SE that\\'s actually a Fix -A-Flat kit you can see it has a BMW \\nlogo on it beca use this vehicle does not have a temporary spare tire if you fold down the seats which by \\n\\nthe way you can do that pretty quickly it\\'s not a completely flat floor but you do expand it out to around \\n32 cubic feet of space so that\\'s much more usable but then that that makes this car just a two -seater \\nvehicle as opposed to a five -seater vehicle mov ing on to the interior of the 2023 Mini Cooper SE let me \\nfirst show you guys the key fob for the vehicle as you can see mini has its own unique fob to other BMW \\nproducts you can tell the buttons come from the BMW family but you used to have to insert this key \\ninto the ignition you no longer have to do that because it has their smart key access system you can see \\nthere\\'s a lock unlock open up the trunk button and there\\'s a panic button somewhere although I can\\'t \\nseem to find the panic button right now uh jus t by looking at this key I don\\'t know if Mini offers a phone \\nas a key feature just yet that is a newer technology that BMW vehicles have but many I don\\'t think has \\nthat feature just yet but as you open the door you can see the two -door variant uh has this really cool \\ninterior color combination or at least my particular tester does it kind of has like a two -tone \\ncombination of a leatherette with this really interesting kind of plaid like material where it\\'s fabric these \\nseats are three level heated which is still very nice they are manually adjusting seats so no memory \\nseating or anything like that I don\\'t think Mini offers a power seat if I remember correctly so that\\'s \\nsomething to kind of keep in mind lines remember this is supposed to be a small more econo my style \\ncar but it has just a lot more character versus some other types of vehicles you can see the door panel \\nhere has pretty decent materials it\\'s a soft touch injection molded plastic a lot of piano black plastic trim \\nmy tester also has the Harman Kar don stereo which is definitely nice sounding and then you have a \\npadded armrest over here window controls Chrome plated and they\\'re one touch automatic up down \\nfor both windows which is definitely nice you have a little bit of storage along with hard touch  panels \\nover there now stepping inside this vehicle has about five inches of ground clearance so it has a lower \\nstep in height and as I get an inch out the door the door has a relatively solid sounding thunk so that \\nactually aids to that impression of qual ity with this vehicle but when you want to start it up you can see \\nmini puts the button right here or it\\'s technically a toggle you have to put your foot on brake and then \\njust kind of push that down and then mini has a really interesting startup chime in this vehicle That\\'s \\nUnique than the versus the gas powered models it almost tries to make it seem more like a spaceship \\nwhich is kind of going with the theme of the electric model you can see the dashboard layout is pretty \\nfamiliar with the gas powered min i I really am looking forward to many doing away with this more \\ntraditional look for the layout it kind of um really just hampers them in terms of Technology you have a \\nreskinned version of BMW\\'s iDrive here I think they just call it Mini connect it\\'s an 8 .8 inch display here \\nyou can see my phone paired up pretty quick it\\'s got Wireless carplay and Android auto I believe and \\nthen the materials here at the upper dashboard is a soft touch injection molded plastic you have this \\nreally cool looking textured thi s is the electric trim it\\'s plastic but it has like this weird texture to it to try \\nthat I guess makes it feel electric there\\'s also a heads up display that flips up I don\\'t like how it\\'s the flip \\nup style I prefer it to be just projected into the windshie ld it kind of just takes away from the heads -up \\ndisplay it\\'s a little distracting for me the steering wheel you can see is a manual tilt and telescoping you \\ndo have pretty good adjustability and range the horn oh wow it actually sounds really mean consider ing \\nhow tiny this car is like the horn and the Toyota Supra sounds pathetic but that actually sounds pretty \\ngood it literally screams Fu I\\'m a small car get out of my way anyways you can see this Center display \\nused to be the tachometer as you can see many  went away with that are the speedometer and \\ntachometer they\\'ve made it done away with that and they put a digital display over here it\\'s starting to \\nlook a little bit dated but it\\'s nice that they give you one that\\'s front and center in the instrument pan el \\nso now this just basically has your hazard switch and the 8.8 inch screen you have a volume knob here \\nyou can also adjust your radio sources there\\'s the mini display here which also includes embedded GPS \\nwhich the GPS is fine again it kind of reminds me  of a BMW this is the same interface you also have the \\nMini connect controller here which you can use if you don\\'t want to touch the screen but again the \\ntouch screen works well in terms of storage this vehicle is lacking a little bit on that you can see t here\\'s a \\nplace where you can store a few things like your sunglasses you have a USB a charging port cup holders \\n\\nhere a few more buttons here for the Dual Zone climate control I mentioned earlier three level heated \\nseats parking sensors this is for adjusting the regen brake you have your choice between low or high \\nregenerative braking and then you can also turn off t he stability control your drive mode selector you \\ncan see there\\'s a sport mode which shows you a graphical there a graphic there and then there\\'s a \\nbalance setting a green and then a green plus that\\'s going to give you the most range but it\\'s also going \\nto sacrifice acceleration and the air conditioning if you put it in the green plus this electronic shifter \\ncontrols the one speed reduction Gear transmission you can see you put in Reverse it has a backup \\ncamera um and it also has automatic parallel parking functions I believe I have somebody has turned off \\nthe trajectory it looks like there we go so there\\'s the trajectory it\\'s active trajectory so the camera \\nquality and resolution is perfectly fine uh I just wish it took up the entire screen you can see it a lso has \\nparking sensors electronic parking brake and then over here padded center console which has actually \\nsome storage in there which is nice you can also lift this up you can see my phone fits in there but \\nthere\\'s no wireless phone charging pad in this  car I don\\'t know if you can get it as an accessory uh that \\nflips up you can also kind of adjust that uh the seats they do they are a little constrict or confining um \\nyou can\\'t adjust the bolsters but I like this kind of two -tone cloth material there\\'s als o a pretty \\nnoticeable thigh Extender on both front seats which is nice manual seat as well on the passenger side \\nthe seats definitely look cool the glove box you can see is uh damped but not lined with felt it\\'s actually \\na pretty decent sized glove box and  then over here you can see there are some controls for the map \\nlighting and then you can also open up the sunroof where you can tilt it or you can open up completely I \\nlove how many gives you that because it just kind of adds to the open and airiness of t his cabin that\\'s \\nthe biggest that it\\'s going to open but again very nice how they give you an opening sunroof to kind of \\ngive the cabin more even more space there\\'s also a sunshine here although this still lets in light when \\nyou have it closed but overall the interior definitely feels on the smaller end the dash is also kind of far \\naway from you but in terms of materials quality I think it\\'s perfectly acceptable considering the price of \\nthis particular model however there are some Minis that can go closer t o fifty thousand dollars that\\'s \\ntoo expensive but I think in the mid thirty thousand dollar range this interior is perfectly fine so let me \\ngo ahead and show you guys the back seat because there is a back seat back here and to get back here \\nyou have to bas ically on both sides you can pull this lever that\\'s going to manually move the seat \\nforward which is technically an easier way versus the power seat now um I\\'m not very tall guys I\\'m five \\nfoot seven so let me go ahead and entertain you all by showing you w hat the space is like back here \\nnow first of all um this seat when you pull it back it actually doesn\\'t come back so as you can see there \\nthe front passenger doesn\\'t have a lot of room this is my driving position so this is where I\\'d have the \\nseat to drive  as you can see there is the leg room here\\'s the leg room when this seat doesn\\'t come back \\nwhich this is perfectly acceptable for me but if I was going to come over here and show you guys what \\nit\\'s like to sit behind myself okay so I can\\'t get my feet unde rneath the seat because there\\'s a decent \\namount of foot space my knees are not touching but my shins are touching the back of the seat so this is \\nnice and padded you have two storage Pockets an armrest here and armrest here and then lots of Hard \\ntouch mate rials I do like how there\\'s a sunroof back here which is definitely nice and then if you look \\nover here you can see I\\'m five foot seven so I have a decent amount of Headroom but for those of you \\nwho are over six feet tall it\\'s not going to be a comfortable  place you can close this as well which is nice \\nthis is all hard touch materials you cannot fit three across I\\'m sorry this only seats four I think I \\nmentioned earlier it actually seats five it only seats four but overall for kids or somebody under five fo ot \\neight like my height or under five foot nine you can sit back here in a pinch but uh you might want to go \\nfor the four -door or the Countryman if you need more space so we are back in the all -electric Mini \\nCooper SE the last time I had a chance to drive this vehicle I was on the media drive for it almost three \\nyears ago because 2020 is when this car first came out and the SE is basically designed to be the electric \\nversion of the Cooper S and we have a single electric motor at the front a 32 kilowatt hour  battery pack \\na 181 horsepower so slightly less horsepower and slightly less torque versus the gas version but mini \\n\\nsays this will do 0 -16 around 6.9 seconds I never actually got a chance to test this car uh when I first \\ndrove it but now that we have our equipment we have it back home let\\'s go ahead and see what we can \\nactually get now make sure it\\'s in sport mode which  you just flick this little toggle up put it into sport \\ntraction as well because this is a front wheel drive car I don\\'t want it to cut power let\\'s see what we can \\nget foreign actually no drama there even with the traction control off I was surprised wow 6 .05 seconds \\nthat\\'s actually pretty fast I wasn\\'t expecting it to be almost a second faster than what many claims now \\ngranted the uh Germans although this is technically the British brand but it\\'s owned by BMW as you \\nguys know tend to be conservative but si x seconds is plenty quick for something like this and even \\nthough this is car\\'s only front wheel drive it puts the power down really well um it doesn\\'t really have \\nlaunch control I tried brake charging there but it doesn\\'t really do anything uh the regen b reaking in this \\ncar is either low or high I have it in high setting now and I really like the wet region breaking it feels like \\nit\\'s almost like a one pedal drive effect so it\\'s nice that they do you know include of that uh ability to do \\neither a low or a high region I think it\\'s just important for people to have that kind of uh ability to kind of \\nchoose flooring it from a stop there without break torquing it 6.38 and this is with it going slightly uphill \\nso again pretty solid performance and I wasn\\'t expec ting it to be this much quicker than versus what \\nminis claim so I have no complaints with the acceleration I suspect this car is actually quicker versus its \\ngas counterpart even if you guys go for the automatic version of that the Dual clutch the automatic  or \\nthe electric mini just is going to be quick off the line because it\\'s got one gear it has no delays in terms of \\nthe transmission shifting or the turbos spooling up just put your foot down in there there it actually \\nspun out the tires a little bit there  oh that\\'s pretty fun I like this car a lot I mean what\\'s cool about the \\nCooper electrics this thing really just keeps the kind of fun go -kart nature of the mini but it almost \\nmakes it feel like you\\'re driving a go -kart an electric go -kart or an electric g olf cart uh because this \\nvehicle is just so playful the suspension is really well uh sorted for handling uh the 17 -inch wheels on my \\ntester not my favorite design but they surprisingly have good grip for a car like this the weight of the \\nCooper SE this is about 200 ish pounds heavier than the gas version I don\\'t really feel it the weight to be \\nhonest it still feels like a really light car I mean this is one of the lightest electric vehicles you can buy at \\n3 200 pounds and it just feels so alive I love how t he steering talks to you I like how the chassis just is \\nvery neutral you don\\'t feel like you\\'re gonna get into trouble with this car it just feels like a point and uh \\nshoot kind of little hatch a little bit of torque steer there with the traction control o ff just putting my \\nfoot down that\\'s hilarious [Laughter] yeah I mean I really like this car when I first drove it three years \\nago but um it\\'s a fun little Urban Runabout type of vehicle I mean really the most disappointing aspect \\nabout the Mini Cooper SE i s the range I mean 114 miles is what many claims and in my weeks for the \\ntesting I only saw around 110 miles on the full charge um that is perfectly acceptable if you guys live in \\nan urban environment however as you can see from where I\\'m at here in the co untry part of \\nPennsylvania um this kind of range is perfectly fine for around town but as soon as I want to take like a \\nlonger trip to go for example the closest airport for me is about 70 miles away I could get there on a full \\ncharge but when I get there I\\'m gonna have to plug it in otherwise when I leave the airport to come \\nback I\\'ll have to find a charging spot or a charging station to plug in at and this is accepting a maximum \\nof 50 kilowatts so it\\'s on the slower end but in terms of range I think for t he Next Generation many \\nshould consider doubling the range I mean 200 miles is the more acceptable range especially for an EV \\neven in this size category evm this is certainly a unique vehicle but I think the Next Generation should \\nhave at least 200 miles o f range I would love to see many offer all -wheel drive although they\\'ve never \\ndone an all -wheel drive gas version so I suspect the Cooper will continue to be front -wheel drive only \\nbut in terms of refinement we\\'ll switch the drive mode here just go into mi d there\\'s like a green mode \\nalso that\\'ll increase the range we\\'ll also turn the traction control back on in terms of daily driving the \\nCooper SE this actually rides better than the regular mini it\\'s because of the battery pack that\\'s kind of \\npushing down o n the car it feels really planted it\\'s also really quiet I mean the four -cylinder turbo and \\nthe minis they sound okay they\\'re not wonderful sounding they sound a little augmented as well so this \\n\\nkind of gets rid of that you go with all a completely quiet Driving Experience which is kind of nice \\nvisibility is excellent you can see out of the fronts the sides the back remember you\\'re driving a car \\nthat\\'s 151 inches long this is among the smallest ne w vehicles you can buy a Miata is bigger than this \\nvehicle which is insane uh and in terms of driver assistance Tech this car does have automatic \\nemergency braking it\\'s got Lane um Lane change assist I believe uh our lane keeping assist but it doesn\\'t \\nhave  adaptive cruise control meaning does not offer adaptive cruise control which might actually be the \\nright decision because this is not something that I would take on longer trips anyways so you\\'re not \\neven going to miss the adaptive cruise it would be nice  again if they offer it but if they\\'re going to offer \\nthat feature they need to double double the range of this car in terms of the tech the wireless carplay is \\nnice this is essentially a a reskinned version of BMW\\'s old iDrive 7. I\\'m really looking forwar d to the next \\nGeneration where mini kind of does away with this dashboard design the steering feels nice in your \\nhands it has good feedback the heads -up display in this car while it is nice I don\\'t like that screen that \\nflips up it just kind of makes the w hole experience look a little cheap but overall still love this car a lot I \\nreally would love to see Minnie do a convertible version of this car before they decide to do away and \\ngo to the Next Generation there\\'s rumors of it but no confirmation yet for ma ny but overall still a great \\nelectric kind of go -kart like machine but it is no longer sadly the cheapest new electric EV that you can \\nbuy in the US so after spending a full week with the all -electric Mini Cooper SE I can comfortably say \\nthat mini continue s to capture all of the charm and Charisma from the gas model of course you are \\nmissing the snarl that you get from the exhaust and the burbles you get from the Dual clutch \\nTransmission in the regular s however what you do get is a car that\\'s way more effi cient that\\'s actually a \\nlittle bit quicker that is a lot cheaper to run because as you guys know electricity is cheap especially if \\nyou have it plugged in at your home and even though the range is not great 110 miles in my real world \\ntesting I think it\\'s t errible if you guys plan to use this as your only vehicle as a second car where you can \\ndrive it around town and you like small Vehicles it makes perfect sense and I think that\\'s partly the \\nreason of the Mini Cooper SE I do hope that many decides to offer it as a convertible because the \\nconvertible aspect just makes this car even more fun so before they decide to introduce the new \\ngeneration which they are working on it would be nice to see them offer it as a convertible in terms of \\nthe pricing if you guys are looking to buy this vehicle it starts around on thirty four thousand dollars it\\'s \\naround two thousand dollars more expensive versus a standard Mini Cooper S now two thousand \\ndollars more is actually kind of a steal and that was kind of the charm of the  Cooper SC when it first \\ncame out is it was one of the most affordable EVS on the market however because of the inflation \\nreduction act this vehicle is built in the UK so it no longer qualifies for the 7 500 federal tax credit so my \\ntester here is a little  over thirty five thousand dollars with basically the 900 driver assistance package \\nthat still lacks adaptive cruise control so you\\'re gonna be paying that price essentially and you no longer \\nget the federal tax credit so the cheapest EV is no longer this vehicle you\\'re gonna have to buy and wait \\nfor like a Chevrolet bolt that will be the cheapest EV however two thousand dollars more expensive \\nversus the gas powered mini I\\'d say that this is still uh worth a look as long as you guys are okay with the \\n110 mi le Real World Range that\\'s something you\\'re gonna have to get used to and be sure to remember \\nto plug it in frequently but if you\\'re using it as a second car that shouldn\\'t be a problem but for the Next \\nGeneration and I would like to see mini essentially d ouble the range for this vehicle with all that said \\nhope you guys have enjoyed my full overview on the 2023 Mini Cooper SE if you\\'re also looking to see \\nthe latest cars I\\'m testing be sure to follow me on Instagram at Redline underscore reviews like us on \\nFacebook and as always guys please keep subscribing to the redline reviews YouTube channel for all the \\nlatest reviews thank you so much for watching I\\'ll catch you all in the next video [Music]  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 Mini Cooper SE  \\n\\nReview:  foreign [Music] welcome back to another freezing cold everyday EV video for today\\'s video we \\nare doing an ownership first impression of the first 1000 miles of our 2023 Mini Cooper SE so we\\'re \\ngoing to give you guys a full tour of all the options that we p icked here for our Mini Cooper SE and what \\nour overall thoughts are any pros or any cons that we have had with this vehicle or any problems that \\nwe have had over the first Thousand Miles yes and the full review of our Mini Cooper will become to \\nclean Technica soon so definitely stay tuned for that and let\\'s dive in before we dive into what options \\nwe went with for our Mini Cooper on the exterior let\\'s talk about why I primarily picked this vehicle now \\nwe were looking for a second vehicle after havin g our Tesla for about six seven months we realized we \\ndid need a second vehicle now we did have a price limit of about thirty five thousand dollars is the max \\nwe wanted to spend on our second car we looked at a number of used EVS like smaller EV is like fo r \\nexample the Chevy Spark EV looked at a first generation Nissan Leaf we also looked at a second \\ngeneration smart for two electric but we didn\\'t really like how those drove we were lucky enough to be \\nable to get a chance to drive the demo version that our dealership our main dealership here had here of \\na Mini Cooper Electric Car 2023 and after spending a whole day with it I fell in love with it now a \\nprevious this by saying that I did sell my 1994 Mazda Miata that I had for quite some time I sold it a year \\nbefore I got this it was just becoming too much of Maintenance and with the gas cost and everything I \\njust didn\\'t really want to deal with it the fun Factor was high on my priority when it came to our second \\nEV and this definitely delivers it and we\\'ll get  into what we feel like it delivers for driving Impressions \\nlater on but after test driving one for an entire day definitely fell in love placed the order took about \\nfour to six months which is pretty typical about what it is right now now we picked the si gnature plus \\n2.0 trim for 2023 I really wanted the base model because I just wanted it to be a standard mini I wanted \\nto spend as less as I could possibly could they\\'re not making that trim for 2023 so we just have a \\nsignature plus 2.0 and I\\'m actually rea lly really happy that we went with this trim because it does have \\nsome features of the base model from before does not have that I\\'m so glad that it now has so we this \\nvehicle all in all with all the options we only picked a few options for this vehicle wa s about 35 000 so \\nright about our our price point that we wanted to spend we went with the British racing green exterior \\nwe\\'ve never had a green car before we wanted to try it out and I have to say we love this color it\\'s very \\nmetallicky it looks really gr eat in the sunlight even here on a Winter\\'s day it also looks really nice as well \\nnow one thing we did ad is I really wanted to have Bonnet Stripes just like the original minis now we did \\ngo with a green and black combination which I kind of like better th an the white roof for example but \\nreally these burning Stripes I think it makes it looks very much like a mini now what\\'s really cool about \\nthe Mini Cooper SE is at least for 2023 there\\'s a number of wheel options that you can pick for your Mini \\nCooper Ele ctric this also does vary slightly if you get the top trim which is the iconic trim now if you \\nwere to get the icon trim which we didn\\'t spend like spending almost you know forty thousand dollars \\nfor that all the trim here on the headlights and also the Be ltline trim and other accents would have been \\na gloss black which really isn\\'t a big deal to us because I actually kind of like the way this chrome looks \\nhere on our vehicle but we went with the 17 inch pedal Wheels as they\\'re called I really like the desi gn \\nthey kind of have this neat little Groove in here now we are wearing the verstein uh wind Track Pro \\nwinter tires right now because it is winter time and trying to drive on summer Tires is a big No -No for us \\nhere it gets way too cold for that and the car  wouldn\\'t be able to handle that so for now we just swap \\nthe tires cut the standard wheels that we got on the Mini Cooper I love the little accents that you get \\nacross the vehicle that\\'s one thing where you can distinguish a electric versus a non -electric mini cooper \\nit\\'s just all these little yellow green accents they have across the board but I love these wheels these are \\nprobably my favorite that I assume which those are going to go for 16s but I kind of like the way the 17s \\nfill out the wheel well here on the Mini Cooper now on the side just like the front the S will be kind of in \\nthat same little electric you know yellow green that they have for minis I like these little touches of \\nelectrification that many includes for the SE now here on the top I we d id go with the black roof and \\nthen the black mirror caps and it gives it you know a pretty nice little look now we did have the windows \\n\\ntinted I always have to have those tinted so it looks really nice and cohesive with the black roof and I \\nreally love the way that looks now one little element that I love about the design of the vehicle is the \\nlittle charge port emblem that you have right here where you can press it and then you have your \\ncharge port right here and speaking about this we primarily charge at home basically just on a level two \\nif we need to charge at a fast charger like an evgo or Electrify America we can we have a few times just \\nto kind of try it out this does charge at a Max of 50 kilowatts or a green four or so really not that fast but \\nwe\\'re really just keeping this to a city car so we\\'re not really going to take too many trips on this vehicle \\nI can\\'t remember back I we did  get the mud flaps and we do have an accessory video for that to add \\nthose from mini just so we had that too I also love the design element of the Union Jack tail lights they \\nare full LED and I actually did recently change this bulb some of the bulbs here on the mini are halogen \\nlike the cargo light and then also the reverse light in the glove box I changed all those to LED that way it \\nlooks a little bit crisper but I like these way the tail lights look they look super cool I like the spoiler I just \\nlike th e Hatchy design of the Mini Cooper SE in general we love hatchbacks I\\'ve had a number of wagons \\nas well so I kind of like the square back that the Mini Cooper hardtop offers I also like that right back \\nhere you also have that same emblem that you have on t he charge port that is outlined here in that kind \\nof looks like a little plug and I kind of like that it\\'s pretty unique but this is basically what we picked for \\nthe exterior of our 2023 Mini Cooper SE I\\'m kind of I\\'m really happy with the way this car loo k looks it \\nlooks fantastic we get a lot of stairs a lot of people point at the car a lot of people really enjoy the Mini \\nCooper and what it looks like and it makes me really happy to have one in the driveway so now that \\nwe\\'ve gone over the exterior let\\'s g o ahead and hop into the inside and show you guys what we picked \\nfor that so here\\'s my Cameo for this video since this is mainly Tyler\\'s car believe it or not in the two to \\nthree months of ownership I\\'ve actually only driven this once and I\\'m going to show  you guys why so to \\nget my seating position we\\'ll just move this back a little bit I\\'ll get in and as I mentioned in previous \\nvideos I\\'m about six one and the seat is all the way down but as you can see I am extremely Limited in \\nterms of headspace this Cen ter bar right here really limits my Headroom and this Pfizer really limits my \\nheadspace as well we are planning on removing this so hopefully this does give me a little bit more of \\nHeadroom but once I\\'m in here it\\'s pretty nice but this and this the combin ation does make it very hard \\nto look over my left shoulder which could be very dangerous when driving but overall I really really like \\nthe interior now I want to talk about some of the technology that is here on a Mini Cooper SE and then \\nsomething that we unfortunately had to miss due to a chip shortage the first thing that we had to miss \\non was the heated steering wheel now it does come standard on our trimmer signature plus 2.0 that we \\nhave but we had to forgo that and the button would have been right her e which I love these tunnel \\nswitches by the way they\\'re so cool you can adjust the regen which is this switch on off traction control \\nthen also your mode buttons are right there too kind of wish that we would have been able to get the \\nheated steering wheel  because I\\'m always cold but that\\'s right because at least I have heated seats in \\nthe winter time now for Tech I love the new screen that Minnie went with in 2022 which is this kind of \\ndigital LCD display this part itself is actually digital the center por tion right here but this is digital with an \\nanalog needle which is really cool and then you can also see your status of your state of charge here for \\nyour battery and this is your power your EV range and then also if you\\'re regening as well but this gives \\na pretty good wide range of information that I need and here on the turn signal stock that we have in \\nthe left hand side there\\'s a button called BC for business control and you can actually sort through the \\nbottom portion here right now in the winter time we\\'re averaging about 3.4 miles to the kilowatt in the \\nsummertime at least the warmer months whenever we got in October and November I was averaging \\nabout 3.8 and that was not driving so nicely so pretty surprised with the efficiency here on Mini Cooper \\nSE it actually is pretty efficient now here at about you know we have Let\\'s see we have about 77 percent \\nof battery it is really cold today it\\'s 26 without the windshield technician to affect the wind and we\\'re at \\nabout 76 miles which is pretty about average  here in the winter time uh with other EVS that we\\'ve had \\nin the past and it really is no big deal for us because there\\'s plenty of level twos that we can charge at \\n\\nwhenever we go shopping if we need to but I love this instrument display it\\'s really nice now if you go \\nfor the iconic trim you would get a heads up display but I actually kind of like this display better what\\'s \\nreally nice too is when you adjust the steer ing wheel it actually moves with the steering column itself so \\nthat\\'s actually something that\\'s super nice now here in the infotainment this is the 8.8 inch screen that \\nyou have here for mini it is either a touch screen or what\\'s really nice is I kind of l ike the mini drive it\\'s \\nkind of like the iDrive and BMWs you have all your switches and knobs here to uh and all of your \\nbuttons to kind of control this as well I find myself actually utilizing the controls more than the actual \\ntouch screen itself probably  because I\\'m used to BMWs in the past uh having to work for them for quite \\nsome time I\\'m just kind of used to how this infotainment works it does have apple carplay no Android \\nauto the only thing is it is wireless and my phone is supposed to be connected t o Apple wireless carplay \\nand it\\'s not showing up so that\\'s something that it happens on occasion that I\\'ve noticed with all cars \\nwith Wireless Apple carplay you can connect it there actually is a USB down here you can connect it with \\ndown here on the botto m where you have your 12 volt as well you can connect it there for Apple \\ncarplay if I need to sometimes it works but most of the time it does work and it plugs in or if it doesn\\'t I \\njust listen to sirius because I pretty much know where I\\'m going most of t he time in this vehicle now in \\nterms of tech I like that you can actually turn that with a on off switch so if we turn that on you do have \\nfrontal Collision warning you have pedestrian warning up front and Lane departure warning you also do \\nhave rear cross  traffic alert and if you put it into reverse here you do have parking sensors as well which \\nshow up here and you also have some guidance lines which move with the steering which is super nice \\nanother thing is whenever you get close to an object the ring w ill actually light up in that same color as \\nyour sensors which is super cool that\\'s another thing too that I love about the mini is this ring so if you \\nwanted to adjust say your temperature you could actually see it getting warmer and colder on the \\nscreen which is super cool it does the same thing with if you are if you have your directions in here with \\nthe mini navigation if you\\'re changing the volume of something on your music or your podcast it\\'ll also \\nshow up here too so it\\'s kind of a neat little featu re now I hope in the future I have seen for some of the \\nfuture models that Minnie\\'s coming out with this will turn into an entire display I do think this is kind of \\nsmall for the vehicle but you know you can make do with with what it is I\\'ve made do with w hat it is but \\nI would love to see this be a full touchscreen in your future models which I know midi is working on \\nreally cool to see that I haven\\'t really used any of the saving functions here you have six save functions \\nfor various things I haven\\'t set a nything to that yet I just pretty much have everything on Apple carplay \\non my iPhone so I really have no need to utilize those buttons other than that the interior I really do like \\nthe vents they\\'re really cool and I like the the circular ones you have her e and kind of like the square \\nones they feel a little nice and another thing too that I found out is based on the type of drive mode that \\nyou have you can also change your ambient lighting so it\\'d be kind of hard to see we can get some night \\nshots but you can change that throughout the day there are so many different colors which is so cool I \\nlove that many includes that tackle switch up here uh but yeah overall the interior is super nice \\nunfortunately for Brandon like you saw this kind of gets in the way b ut for me I am really short so it\\'s \\nreally easy for me to get in and out another thing too is we have had some people in the back seat only \\none time which is Brandon\\'s parents they\\'ve been in the back seat of uh our Mini Cooper and we\\'ve only \\ndone a short trip with them we probably won\\'t do any long trips with people in the back because it just \\nthere really is nothing in the back seat for people unless you\\'re really smoke a small kid obviously like I \\nsaid like we\\'ve had our dogs in here where the seats fold ed and there\\'s plenty of room for them plenty \\nof room for all of our trips the only thing too is there is limited Hardware space when the seats are up \\nwe can fit maybe four bags from Whole Foods in there if you want to add more space to your Mini \\nCooper yo u would have to fold the seats down I would love to see Mini Cooper do a four -door hardtop \\nversion of the SE be really nice to actually have a usable back seat for adults and anybody of any height \\nand then also have a little bit more cargo space I know the y\\'re working on a future EV models like the \\naceman for example which I\\'m really excited about but for right now just really enjoying our Mini \\n\\nCooper so now that we\\'ve talked about everything from the exterior the interior let\\'s go ahead and talk \\nabout some driving Impressions that we have of our Mini Cooper SC okay so now we\\'re gonna get into \\ndriving impressions of our Mini Cooper SC but first t here\\'s a sound that Brandon finds extremely \\nannoying in this car it\\'s the startup sound and it\\'s not so much like I don\\'t know it\\'s just like the the \\nchime that some vehicles have when they\\'re at idle it does not stop especially if you\\'re not like starting  \\nto drive it will just keep going and it drives me nuts okay that sound and now we\\'re good to go but \\nsometimes it will literally just keep going it will there\\'s times where it will it doesn\\'t really annoy me but \\nit does annoy Brandon probably because our T esla doesn\\'t really make a whole lot of sounds no it starts \\nup no I mean every vehicle has their things and yeah it\\'s quirky and cute but the fact that it just keeps \\ngoing yeah I\\'ll just leave it at that so let\\'s start driving impressions okay so now for d riving impressions \\nof our Mini Cooper SE so we primarily drive like I\\'ve mentioned in the city so we\\'re just kind of used to \\nstreets like this park system for example and being a passenger in the mini is very nice I mean what\\'s \\nweird and I find this a lot with a lot of vehicles I actually have more headspace than the passenger seat \\nthan in the driver\\'s seat not exactly for sure what that\\'s about um but it is more comfortable for me to \\nbe in the passenger than it is to be in the driver\\'s seat um there are st ill some times where this middle \\nbar does impact my Headroom but overall it\\'s a great place to be as a passenger depends on if you\\'re \\ndoing your hair for the day or not uh yes yeah or if I have a hat too but I don\\'t know I I like being a \\npassenger in this car because I know Tyler enjoys driving it I do as a driver like I said the car itself is \\nextremely engaging to drive so I\\'m used to a lot of like you know sports cars like Miatas and Mustangs \\nand other fun to drive you know hatchbacks and station wagons s o I\\'m used to a very dynamically \\ndriven vehicle and this definitely is one of that now it is winter time so I\\'m not going to push into some \\nof the curves here or the turn returns that we have in our Park systems but during the warmer months I \\nwould do it a ll the time I would come to this park system of the national park and just have a blast drive \\nin this and that\\'s the thing is yeah this does have you know over about 200 pound feet of torque but it \\ncomes on so quick it actually jerks the steering wheel hal f the time it has quite a lot of torque sticker \\nyeah I will say that that\\'s one of my favorite things about the one time I\\'ve driven this is the amount of \\ntorque that goes right to the front wheels is very impressive and the car really handles well it\\'s ve ry \\nbalanced yeah the steering uh right now I\\'m in Comfort mode there is Sport I\\'ve had it in green it\\'s also \\nGreen Plus which also turns off your climate control so I\\'ve really needed to save those last few miles \\nwhich I have had to do one time I\\'ve had ve ry very low range like one percent and I did have to put it \\ninto green plus it does limit your acceleration and the regen changes quite a bit too I do keep it in Max \\nregen pretty much all the time now it hasn\\'t snowed so when it does snow I\\'ll probably swi tch it over \\ninto low regen instead of Max regen because it does do a really good job of stopping this car um it does \\nhave what I would consider one pedal driving pretty much for the most part there are times where I \\nnoticed if you are on incline facing dow nward the car kind of rocks a little bit or if you\\'re facing up it also \\nkind of rocks a little bit too but I still like the car it does do kind of like an auto hold ish feature if you\\'re \\non a hill but if you\\'re on a slight incline going down a decline goin g down there really isn\\'t too much of \\nan auto hold feature hopefully many improves that in the future it\\'d be kind of nice to actually have that \\non the whole feature like a lot of EVs do but this one doesn\\'t in particular and as Tyler mentioned with \\nregene rative braking the mini regen is really good um it\\'s very strong uh even it at 100 state of charge \\nthe region still works very well and that\\'s one thing that we do want to point out is because the battery \\nis relatively on the smaller side there is a gap be tween the total capacity of the battery as well as total \\nusable um you know or usable capacity for the battery pack so you can charge this to 100 and you won\\'t \\nsee degradation like you might see in some electric vehicles right one thing that we\\'ve noticed too \\nabout the mini is there\\'s no way to change the charge limit of the vehicle so when we plug it in \\nwhenever we\\'re done for the day or whatever we\\'re doing it just automatically plugs up to 100 which is \\nfine because you know this is the same powertrain an d platform essentially as the BMW i3 so BMW has \\nreally done their engineering and their Research into this battery pack it really doesn\\'t bother us that we \\n\\ncharge it to 100 and then do what we need to do I would say because of the low range we definitely do \\nwant to charge most of it to 100 that way we have all the range that we can you know we\\'re here in the \\nwinter months so we don\\'t have the you know 114 mil es that it\\'s ready for right now but even in this \\ncolder temperature we\\'re still seeing impressive range so not only is this vehicle really fun to drive it \\nalso is really efficient too even with the 17 inch wheels and tires that we have on this vehicle and  I \\nwasn\\'t sure how the ride quality was going to be because 16 is the sidewall in the 16 inch wheels are \\nmuch thicker so probably would have been a little bit more comfortable but those cars actually pretty \\ncomfortable does have a short wheelbase obviously  because it is a two -door hatchback so on some of \\nthe bigger bumps and potholes that we have here in Cleveland it definitely is kind of a bouncier ride but \\nI also know the spring and shock setup is a little bit stiffer because because they do have the extr a \\nweight of the battery pack here in the Mini Cooper it is a little bit higher up than a gas version of this \\nwould be but you can still have all the many fun that you possibly want to have in this I kind of think \\nthat the electric version obviously is a lo t better to drive it\\'s a lot more engaging you have the power \\nexactly when you want to have the power and the regen is really fun to just kind of let off the throttle \\nand just regen down this hill for example now in this city I think you know for as small this vehicle is \\nitself required than I think some are within its class of about thirty five thousand dollars it\\'s really hard \\nbecause there\\'s not a whole lot of just two -door electrified competitors under 35 000 you look at the \\nNissan Leaf or the Chevy bol t are probably the two closest competitors to this vehicle we did look at \\nthose but they\\'re not as engaging and fun to drive as this vehicle is and that\\'s where my opinion differs \\nslightly I mean especially since we owned a bolt for a few years I definitel y think the bolt does have \\nsome engaging Dynamics but if you really are looking for a flat small compact vehicle definitely look at \\nthe mini but the only thing that really holds this vehicle back is the range um if it had just a little bit \\nmore range this vehicle definitely could be a more capable car but just for like everyday driving in my \\npersonal opinion the range is the biggest thing that holds this vehicle back definitely and I know Minnie \\nis working on future iterations of these vehicles I really hop e they improve that range at least 200 miles \\nwould be nice to see in a vehicle like this in Faster charging too we have charged this at evgo stations \\nbefore um it is only 50 kilowatts so it really doesn\\'t charge that fast but actually because the battery \\npack is small it\\'s funny I feel like most of the time we look at it and it\\'s been 25 30 minutes and the car is \\nalready at 80 90 and then we\\'re ready to go you know if we if we need to go somewhere else but also \\non the Highway 2 we are on you know some of th e Metro Park roads here but even on the highway the \\ncar is really compliant it\\'s really easy the only thing I\\'ve noticed on the highway is because of how direct \\nthis steering is you have to make any little uh you know movements that you make of the wheel i s really \\nsharp so like you know if you\\'re trying to make it Center then I feel like it does get a little Twitchy which \\nis fine you know this is kind of like a fun to drive vehicle so I feel like any like little movements kind of \\nmove it around but I like j ust how direct it is and you know it\\'s just it\\'s a lot of fun to drive and that\\'s \\nkind of the primary thing that I really wanted of a second electric vehicles I really wanted that fun to \\ndrive factor and we have so many great roads here that you know we ha ve so many great Park systems \\nand side roads and highways and Scenic ways and it\\'s just so cool to take this vehicle on those maybe \\none day I\\'ll be able to drive it gotta move that sun visor first yes so now that we\\'ve had this for you \\nknow we\\'re actually at almost about a thousand miles on this vehicle um I do not for one second regret \\ngetting this vehicle at all despite the range you know people will say oh 114 miles is not enough \\nrealistically if this is like your second car or even if you have small com mutes this is perfectly fine you \\nknow for those situations this car is so easy to maneuver too I love the maneuverability of a any tight \\nparking spaces or city streets it\\'s really easy to kind of drive that around but I really for one minute I I \\ndon\\'t I do n\\'t regret this purchase at all it was probably one of my favorite purchases we ever made it \\nwas really easy to do this purchase I loved the entire build process that mini has on their website you \\nhave your mini tracker kind of reminded us of like a Domino  Pizza Tracker where you could see like uh \\noh there\\'s a mini Wave by the way it\\'s really cool but it was just so cool to like track the entire process of \\n\\nseeing our Mini Cooper being built and then like anticipating that day that we got to pick it up October \\nyes yeah and it\\'s been fun watching Tyler get so excited about this it\\'s it\\'s a vehicle that I\\'m still getting \\nused to um you know it\\'s it\\'s a car that  I obviously have not driven much you know I\\'ve mentioned that a \\nfew times throughout this video but as mentioned earlier it\\'s a lot of fun to even just sit in here and just \\nexperience the driving Dynamics and see how excited Tyler is to have a mini becaus e it is a lot of fun to \\nhave a Mini Cooper it is this I think now that you know still kind of in those honeymoon phases as you \\nsay of having a brand new car but we\\'ve had no issues with this vehicle at all now there\\'s no wood to \\nknock on in this car no um and I know many Coopers of the past especially the gas models have been \\nextremely unreliable as they get older but I think with this powertrain it\\'ll be perfectly fine um I am \\nprobably going to keep this until the next generation of Cooper Mini Cooper hard tops come out I really \\nwant to see a convertible electric car under forty thousand dollars that\\'s what I really want to see yes \\nyeah and while we\\'re on the top of that mini did say that they are working on a convertible version of \\nthis for the next generat ion of Mini Cooper Electric so that\\'s going to be super exciting and I really hope \\nthat we just start seeing different body styles of electrified Vehicles because it is really cool to have a \\ntwo-door coupe hatchback that\\'s electric I\\'m pretty sure Minnie\\'s  the only one on the market here in \\nthe United States that has something like this so it\\'s very unique and of course put their new models \\nthey\\'re gonna be able to stretch that and modulate their platforms for bigger vehicles like SUVs or four \\ndoors or your  convertibles or another hard top like this so super excited about the new mini \\nelectrification plan that Minnie is coming up with and they\\'re going to be doing for their future models \\nuh and honestly can\\'t wait to see more because this car has made me so excited I love driving this I \\nmake any excuse possible literally in the book to drive this over our Tesla I\\'m just happy to see Tyler \\nhappy me too well that\\'s pretty much it for you know driving Impressions overall thoughts of our Mini \\nCooper SE and you kn ow if you guys want us to do any in -depth videos with this vehicle or you have any \\nspecific questions about maybe a feature or how things work on this car let us know and we\\'ll do a video \\non that we want to do as many videos as possible on the Mini Cooper Electric there are some out there \\nbut we would love to add more to the collection on YouTube definitely and if you like this video make \\nsure you like and share with your friends and as always please consider subscribing to the everyday EV \\nYouTube channel a s Tyler mentioned we\\'re excited to share all this content provide more EV education \\nand just get people really excited about these products well as always make sure you take care stay

introduced back in \\n2020 but mini has decided to give this car already a facelift now in this video i\\'m gonna take you through \\nthe interior and the exterior of the car i\\'m gonna show  you everything that is new on this 2022 model \\nkeep in mind this is probably not the car you want to have if you\\'re planning to do a lot of long distance \\ntraveling because of the range of this car however is this the best electric city car now let\\' s find out in \\nthis video now before we start the video if you haven\\'t already subscribed to the channel this is \\nprobably the best time to do it alright let\\'s get started hey guys welcome back to the channel this is the \\nmini electric the mini that is run by  battery power this is the 2022 model so the brand new model it\\'s \\nthe facelift model which is a little bit odd considering that the mini has only been on the market since \\n2020 but mini gave the regular petrol minis a facelift last year so while they were a t it they also give the \\nelectric a facelift next year mini will release the all -new generation mini somewhere around in 2023 now \\nthat car will again be available with regular petrol engines and as a fully electric version just like this \\nversion now this is  the current generation of the mini electric and i\\'d say this version is still pretty \\nrelevant it just received the facelifts now before we\\'re going to discuss the updated interior and the \\n\\nspecifications we\\'re going to talk about the exterior design what is new here on the outside of the mini \\nelectric the mini electric always kind of looked the same like a regular mini cooper especially this facelift \\nmodel only has a couple of subtle changes  compared to the mini three doors with a petrol engine so \\nlet\\'s discuss what\\'s new here compared to the previous mini electric first of all there\\'s a new bumper \\nand there\\'s a new grille now the grille now has the body color of the car which on this car is british \\nracing green the fog lamps are now removed from the lower part of the bumper and are now integrated \\nin the headlights that still have the round daylight running lights running all the way around it now \\ninstead of the fog lights you now get the spor ty vertical air inlets on the side on the lower part of the \\nbumper and there\\'s also a pretty sporty lip here on the lower part of the bumper as well here on top \\nyou get led headlights as standard there\\'s a little yellow s logo on this electric version and you also get a \\nblacktop mini logo on this particular version as well and there\\'s even a hood scoop which is not \\nfunctional because you totally don\\'t need it on an electric car but i have to admit it looks pretty cool not \\na lot of changes on the side of the  car only a couple of things i want to mention for example the new \\nturn signals that you got here on the side and they have a little bit of plastic cladding going around it \\nand there\\'s a yellow s logo again telling people that this is the fully electric ve rsion now the turn signals \\nare now also fully led then let\\'s talk about the wheels these are also new these are the tentacle spoke \\nwheels 17 -inch looking pretty classy with the black glossy finish and with the spoke design you also got \\nsome blacked out mir ror caps on this particular version and some black door handles and looking again \\npretty classy combined with the blacked out wheels now the mini three doors is basically a coupe so you \\ngot these frameless windows here again looking pretty classy you also can get some tinted windows but \\nyou have to pay extra for that now there\\'s something about this mini electric that i didn\\'t know and \\nthat\\'s the fact that this car is actually a bit higher than a regular mini now this car is definitely not a high \\ncar but it  is in fact two centimeters higher than a regular mini now that is because this electric version \\nhas a battery pack which is obviously pretty heavy and they don\\'t want this car to scrape on the ground \\nwhen you go over speed bumps so they raise the car a li ttle bit give it a little bit stiffer suspension and \\nthat\\'s why this car is a little bit higher than a regular mini now they cleverly disguised that fact by giving \\nthis car a little bit more plastic cladding around the wheel arches so you\\'d probably never tell that this \\ncar is actually a little bit higher than a regular mini unless you park a regular mini next to this mini \\nelectric here on the back end there are a couple of subtle changes compared to the outgoing model you \\nnow get a new bumper with an integ rated diffuser here on the lower part with some integrators and fog \\nlights you still get the union jack tail lights you got these a standard just as the spoiler that you get as \\nstandard as well this particular version again you had the blacked out mini log o also the blacked out \\ncooper logo now on the left side of the car you get a yellow badge a bright yellow batch that says e now \\ntogether with the yellow s patch on the front it says s e which was originally the name for this mini \\nelectric i believe at mini  they still call this the mini cooper se or the se cooper or something like that but \\nyou know everybody basically calls this the mini electric all right let\\'s discuss cargo space now obviously \\nthis being a mini you don\\'t have too much space here in the bac k there\\'s 211 liters which is not much \\nbut it is definitely enough for your daily groceries there\\'s also some underfloor storage here as well for \\nyour charging cables now if you really want to have a bit more storage space you have to fold down the \\nrear se ats that you can do in 60 40 configuration then you have 730 something liters which is actually \\npretty good for such a compact car now what is really clever here in the cargo space is the fact that you \\ncan tilt the back seats a little bit more forward so t hey have a different angle so you got a little bit more \\ncargo space here in the back there\\'s a little a metal plate that you can slide forward so the back seats \\nwill stay up straight now it does mean that it is basically impossible to seat on the back seat s uh when \\nthey\\'re a little bit more angled straight up but again you do get more cargo space so if you don\\'t use the \\nback seats or there\\'s only like a small child there it\\'s actually a very good solution [Music] now according \\nto mini here in the interior t hey have used some better materials now i have to say honestly the interior \\nwell always felt quite premium in a mini and again it all feels very premium you got a lot of soft \\n\\nmaterials on the dashboards on the door panels here on the armrest it all feels basically like a mini bmw \\nnow obviously bmw is the owner of mini and you can really tell here in the interior it all feels well again \\nreally like you\\'re driving a mini bmw take  for example the toggle switches that are everywhere in this \\ncar not just down here but also here on top they\\'re not made out of plastic they are made out of \\naluminium there\\'s a lot of weight to them and they feel really good now let\\'s quickly discuss the toggle \\nswitches because there are quite a lot of them the one here on top well one of them operates the \\npanoramic roof which is a thousand euro extra or option rather and the other toggle switches are here \\nto control like the reading lights the toggle swit ches down here some of them are also in the regular \\nmini some of them are only in this fully electric version so take for example the toggle switch that \\ncontrols the level of regen on this car this is an electric car so you can use the regenerative braking  \\nsystem on this electric car so if you let go of the accelerated pedal the car will automatically slow down \\nusing the electric motor to slow down the car you will actually win back some energy by doing so and \\nit\\'s just a very comfortable way of driving now  there are two levels of regen on this car now when you \\nstart the car it will automatically be on the highest setting so if you let go of the accelerator pedal the \\ncar will break pretty firm using the electric motor but you can also put it on a lower setti ng if you prefer \\nthat now the infotainment screen and infotainment system that you get here in the center is basically \\nthe same system that you got in the previous model um which is not terrible but it is becoming a little \\nbit outdated it doesn\\'t run the n ewest bmw i drive eight system for example i believe this is still i drive \\nsix so yeah getting a bit outdated it\\'s not like super laggy however you can notice that it is running a \\nlittle bit slow now and then now behind the steering wheel you do get a very  very cool looking digital \\ngauge cluster you already had this one in the previous model as well and now you also get this one in \\nregular mini models with a petrol engine it\\'s a very nice screen to look at the graphics are very sharp \\nand you can see all the  information that you basically need you can also see the range on this car very \\nclear which is sometimes a bit of an issue so let\\'s talk range on this car now this car doesn\\'t have the \\nbiggest battery pack and that is basically the biggest flaw of this ca r the battery pack is almost 33 \\nkilowatt hours i believe 32.6 and giving it this car an official range of 234 kilometers now obviously in \\nreality you can never make that you can always deduct at least 50 kilometers from the official range so \\nlet\\'s say on a  good day this car will do about 180 kilometers which is plenty for most people i mean i \\ndon\\'t drive 180 kilometers every day rarely actually but still sometimes you want to drive a bit further \\nand then oh you get some serious range anxiety in this car how ever this being a mini this being a city car \\nit shouldn\\'t be a problem for most people but you do have to keep in mind that this car doesn\\'t have the \\ngreatest range it is a bit of a shame that they didn\\'t offer a bigger battery in this car they didn\\'t fill  up \\nthe entire floor of the car with batteries i\\'m pretty sure on the next generation of the mini electric they \\nwill definitely give the car a better range now fast charging this car can do up to 50 kilowatts which is \\nalso not really fast you really need a  half an hour to fill up the battery up to 80 and then you still have a \\nrange of around 140 150 kilometers if you\\'re lucky so again the range is not the most impressive aspect \\nof this car what is however impressive is the handling of this car this is one o f the most fun electric cars \\nyou can drive and i\\'m even including cars like the poorest icon audi e -tron rs this is just a very zippy uh \\nand fun driving car you know all minis are famous for their handling mini likes to call it the go -kart \\nfeeling like you \\'re driving a go -kart and even in this electric version it\\'s still a very fun car to drive you \\nknow the car is a little bit higher up but the battery pack actually and makes sure that this car has a \\nlower center of gravity making this car maybe even more f un to drive than let\\'s say a cooper s maybe \\neven a junk cooper works no probably not that one but i think it is more fun to drive than a cooper as \\nyou got the instant torque of the electric motor that\\'s 270 newton meters of torque 184 horsepower so \\njust ar ound the same uh amount of horsepower as you get in a cooper s but you do get that instant \\ntorque which really propels this car uh makes this car leap forward really fast the car will do zero to 100 \\nkilometers an hour or zero to 62 miles an hour in 7.3 sec onds uh but it is the zero to 60 kilometers an \\nhour time that really is impressive it\\'s 3.9 seconds and it even feels more impressive than that number \\n\\nhonestly when you hit the accelerated pedal on this car it really goes flying making this car a lot of fun to \\ndrive and also in the corners this car handles really well so all in all i think this is a perfect electric city car \\nyou got plenty of range for t he city uh if you go outside of the city you do have to consider the range but \\nyou can have a lot of fun outside of the city with this car so those are my impressions of the 2022 mini \\nelectric if you like this video don\\'t forget to hit that like button and  if you want to see more videos like \\nthis in the future and don\\'t forget to hit that subscribe button and i\\'ll see you at the next one [Music] \\nyou \\n \\nCar Model : 2022 Mini Cooper SE  \\nReview:  let\\'s go oh yeah instant talk baby oh yeah oh [Applause] oh i have never been more anxious in \\nmy entire life than today you see behind me is the mini cooper se it\\'s a pretty cool full ev hatchback that \\ngets about kilometers of range now that makes sense in  a country like france where you\\'re in paris you \\nneed a small little ev 160 k\\'s will take you to the the mullen rouge and back but here in australia i can\\'t \\nget to the bloody shops without running out of range and then worrying am i going to get home in fa ct \\ni\\'ve come to bmw which is actually the closest ev charger to my home and i live in like central \\nmelbourne i\\'ve driven 20 minutes the car\\'s on 60 battery and i\\'d like i\\'m worried i won\\'t make it home \\nand it\\'s going to take hours to charge the charging ne twork in australia sucks i\\'m going to insert a clip \\nhere so you can see what it\\'s been like for me so jacob what\\'s it like uh trying to charge up a car in \\naustralia we\\'re not hold for 25 minutes been on hold for 25 minutes i got places to be man people to \\nsee you got things to do i got things to do man and my nose is huge but we\\'re not here to talk about \\nthat we\\'re here to talk about this the mini cooper se some market or actually only the uk cause of the \\nmini cooper electric like it\\'s a pretty cool car i\\'m  gonna take you all around it we\\'ll show you the exterior \\nthe interior what it\\'s like to drive some people call this a true hot hatch i will give you my opinion on \\nthat we\\'re also going to launch it using my specialist timing here and then i\\'ll end on shou ld you buy a \\nmini cooper s e or a mini cooper se multi -tone roof as this trim is called bit weird all right let\\'s get \\nstraight into it now before we get into the review i\\'m actually going to explain why we\\'re filming it like \\nthis no joke this really is lik e the closest charger to my home it\\'s at the bmw headquarters which is \\npretty convenient because i get free charging the annoying thing is that one of the chargers the mini \\none doesn\\'t work uh so we\\'ve had to use the bmw we spent like 25 minutes on the pho ne it was \\nabsolutely ridiculous so the car\\'s gonna be framed like this for a while it just has to be because \\notherwise i\\'m not getting home now one of the main reasons you\\'re going to spend 70 000 australian \\ndollars on a mini cooper se is because of its lo oks it is a very good looking car there is no doubt about \\nthat very very stylish don\\'t know how i feel about this ombre roof with its blue and blue and black look \\nit\\'s a bit extra for me but i can understand why some people would get it so what do you get as standard \\nwhere you get full led lights they are super duper bright and they look really cool too uh mini badge \\nhere you\\'ve got fake hood scoop here because guess what underneath here there is a real engine not let \\nme show you so in most electric cars yo u would find storage under here at least most normal electric \\ncars but never the bmw\\'s it seems because there is no storage space under here i\\'m pretty sure you\\'ve \\ngot your you know your motor at the front and whatever but yeah what ah you\\'re not gonna fit  your \\nsuitcase in there my friends ow oh it\\'s actually kind of cool i like that electric can\\'t electrocute myself \\nbro electricity can\\'t electrocute electricity am i right what\\'s different about this from any other mini \\ncooper well it\\'s the frontier you can  see a lot of it is blocked up for aerodynamic purposes you don\\'t \\nneed to call any engine so you block it up makes it more aero makes sense and as you can see here \\nthere is the s badge here this is the se so i guess it\\'s got comparable performance to a sta ndard cooper s \\nyou\\'re just spending like 30 grand more but who cares right no difference coming to the rest of the side \\nyou\\'ve got these optional tentacle wheels here they call them and they do look pretty cool i like how \\n\\nthey\\'re blacked out they\\'re 17 inches and they\\'re wrapped in pirelli cintaratos never heard of them in \\nmy life but you probably have blacked out mirror caps here it\\'s pretty uh bougie you\\'ve also got oh look \\nat that door handles but they do have kayla cent er and go of course this is the mini yours trim which is \\nlike top of the range trim as i said this is the mini cooper se miniors multi -tone roof that is literally the \\nname of the trim and uh yeah it\\'s a coupe by the way so it does have frameless windows he re and it\\'s \\npretty damn cool i\\'ll admit again i\\'m sorry about the framing of these shots uh as i said we were really \\non the phone for like 25 30 minutes just to find out that one of the charges uh wasn\\'t working so we \\nhave to keep it in this position it\\'s going to look a little bit weird but whatever it\\'s still it works okay it \\nworks so at the back we have these really cool union jack tail lights i like them a lot they look really sick \\nand you can buy them together it makes the full uh uk flag go to the uk we\\'ve also got a roof spoiler \\nhere we\\'ve got blacked out badging i really like this this is the electric badge so that you know that this \\nis the ev but otherwise it\\'s a very good looking car i don\\'t know though if it\\'s you know if you should buy \\none of the se just because of its looks as i said this thing is 70 000 you could spend quite a bit less maybe \\nlike seven grand or something and get yourself a rear -wheel drive tesla model three and then you\\'re \\ngetting about two and a half times the range a bit more p racticality and reliability is gonna be the same \\nbecause they\\'re electric cars anyway so i don\\'t know it\\'s a bit of a tough sell but let me know in the \\ncomment section down below what do you think about the the looks of this car it\\'s a very good looking \\ncar but would that pull you over the edge over a tesla model 3 i\\'m unconvinced let\\'s talk about the \\ninterior so what\\'s the interior like well it\\'s pretty awesome and it\\'s one of the reasons that you would \\nactually buy the mini cooper se and it\\'s because you get a pretty premium luxury special interior so \\nthere are things to like but things not to like let\\'s start with the things i like first of all soft touch \\nabsolutely everywhere it feels super duper premium in here and it feels like a million bucks like ser iously \\non the on par of bmw of course who own mini but uh yeah you can see where the inspiration came \\nfrom you\\'ve got some cool touches here like some toggle switches down here some of them do ev stuff \\nover a standard mini as you would expect this one here  is for your regen and this one here is for \\nchanging your sport mode or into green or green plus where it turns off your air conditioning and i have \\nbeen doing that to save range that\\'s how much range anxiety i\\'ve got in this car uh but you\\'ve also got \\nsom e other toddler switches up here which change the lighting things like that and it\\'s just a really sleek \\ncool layout i like it a lot what\\'s not to like is that you\\'re using a older infotainment display or older \\ninfotainment system kind of like the bmw idri ve 6 system they\\'re now up to eight which means it\\'s fine \\num it\\'s a bit laggy you still get like a i drive e controller down here it\\'s almost the same not quite as \\nergonomic as before but it\\'s a fine system you do get wireless apple carplay though though n o wireless \\nandroid auto so if you have an android phone you\\'re not bougie enough to have a mini sorry you\\'ve also \\ngot a storage area here it\\'s not really a storage area actually it\\'s just your wireless charger which would \\nbe great but if you have any sort of flagship phone like for me i\\'ve got the iphone max 13 whatever if i \\ntry and put it in there just no chance in hell it\\'s an older system they had in like the bmw x2 in fact they \\nstill have it in the bmw x2 i mean at least you get a wireless charger but y ou\\'re gonna have a pretty \\nsmall phone to get it in there and then you\\'ve got no storage though it does lift up you\\'ve got storage \\nspace there couple of cupholders look i\\'ve got my obligatory water bottle fits a couple of cup holders in \\nthere absolutely fin e you\\'ve got a storage area up front for your phone a usb c port a usb a port and \\nlook a little 12 volt socket so plenty of io as they call it let\\'s put that down there and there you go then \\nhere we have a glove box which is a pretty decent size like that a lot the dorbians are tiny really really \\nsmall you\\'re not getting a water bottle in there now as i said this is the mini yours trim which means that \\nit\\'s premium and you do get these awesome seats here they call them lounge seats they\\'ve got the \\nunion jac k in the headrest they look really cool and they feel super duper comfy again really premium \\nwould be a lot more premium than the seats that you get for example in a base model tesla model 3 so i \\nguess that\\'s a good thing you\\'ve also got a harman kardon so und system which does sound it\\'s very \\ngood up in front of you you get a digital instrument cluster it\\'s pretty average and also it\\'s on an angle in \\n\\nevery single mini and it does my head in it\\'s like slightly tilted to the left which is a bit annoying for \\nsomeone like me who notices those kinds of things but it does have a pretty cool layout ev specific of \\ncourse up front you get a heads up display whi ch is really annoying because if you have the steering \\nwheel in the wrong position for example i usually like to have my steering wheels a bit higher then all of \\na sudden i can\\'t actually see the heads -up display so that kind of sucks speaking of steering wheel it is a \\nvery nice steering wheel it\\'s uh one of the i guess older style bmw steering wheels but nothing wrong \\nwith that it feels super nice to hold on to on the hands you do have buttons to control a lot of things but \\nthey feel plasticky and pretty h orrible to be totally honest with you and also everything in here is a circle \\nand i mean everything from the air vents to the door handles to the speaker housing to this \\ninfotainment display which i didn\\'t mention actually has lighting and it\\'s dynamic lig hting so for example \\nif i change the temperature it like moves around it\\'s kind of cool i don\\'t know oh it\\'s a lot of beeps and \\noh anyway what\\'s it like in the back seats let\\'s go let\\'s talk about that now even though this is a sleek \\ntwo-door you do get ba ck seats so to get into them you reach around you grab that slide the seat \\nforward just did leg day and i\\'m in a lot of pain oh my gosh oh my gosh it\\'s not it\\'s not it\\'s not the \\ndifficulty of getting in the back it\\'s just my legs being poop so once you\\'re back here the seats are super \\nduper comfy we can slide this back god damn it jacob why do you have your seat so far back can you \\njust pull the seat forward so if the person in the front seat makes compromises you can have people sit \\nin the back although it \\'s you know you will have to make compromises but it is very very comfy back \\nhere i\\'ll give you that you get two seats back here which is kind of enough no no in all seriousness it\\'s \\nactually pretty damn good back here i i wouldn\\'t mind sitting back here b ut the front person might mind \\nbecause their legs are going to be on the dash so it is what it is fam let\\'s talk about practicality now the \\nmini is not just mini in name it is mini in size thankfully the ev doesn\\'t actually lose any internal space \\nbecause the battery\\'s so small so maybe that\\'s a win there i guess but yeah it doesn\\'t have much space \\nregardless so you might be able to fit a full suitcase in there and that\\'s about it you do get underfloor \\nstorage and that\\'s where your charging cables live this  one is your like home emergency trickle charger \\nthe other one here is when you\\'re out and about and you have access to faster charging options yeah \\nit\\'s not a huge amount of space but you can put down the back seats using these fun little plugs here if \\ni\\'m if i\\'m tugging if i\\'m yanking on your chain and then yeah you get plenty of space if you do that so \\nwhile we were just filming the b -roll then i just saw this really cool feature so yes if you put it like that \\nthe seats are all the way back you\\'re not go ing to fit a full suitcase in there i don\\'t think it\\'d be real \\nstruggle but you can lift up this tab here pull it back means the back seat people aren\\'t going to be \\nhaving a great time but it means you get quite a lot more room in the back so that\\'s pretty  cool spec \\ntime now of course this doesn\\'t have an engine but we\\'ll still pop the hood anyway under here is a fake \\ncover as we showed earlier but it doesn\\'t really matter it does have a pretty awesome setup it actually \\ncomes from the bmw i3 the old outdate d but amazingly weird bmw that i never have driven but i wish i \\nhad you\\'ve driven it yeah where my test drive really yeah oh how was it yeah really cool everything was \\nvery sustainable very stable so it\\'s powered by a 32.6 kilowatt hour battery that\\'s abou t half of the size \\nthat you\\'ll find in most other evs now at least full evs so 135 kilowatt of power 270 newton meters of \\ntorque that\\'s actually quite a lot of course this thing does weigh a little bit more than a standard mini \\nbecause of the batteries and  whatnot so you get about the same performance as a mini cooper s but \\nthat doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a slouch it\\'s actually quite quick especially when you consider things like instant \\ntorque but we\\'ll come back to that in a moment now charging is a pretty average  story i guess it\\'s kind \\nof similar to pretty much every other ev on the market at least offered from bmw at the moment so you \\nhave an ac charge current at max 11 kilowatt if you use dc charging it\\'s 50 kilowatt although in australia \\nit\\'s so hard to find a  dc charge as i said there is none around my house this is the fastest i can find so \\nwe\\'re doing 11 kilowatt hour charging we came here at 60 battery and now it\\'s been no joke about an \\nhour what are we at we\\'re at 70 so yeah it\\'s not the quickest out there  if you\\'re gonna be charging this \\nyou\\'re going to be charging this at home and if you do so you can use a it comes with a like an \\n\\nemergency charger that you can plug into your home but really bmw sorry mini wants you to install a \\nwall box in your home to plug it up and charge it up okay so now we\\'re going to launch the mini cooper \\nse it\\'s not entirely fair because we\\'re both sitting in the car but many do claim that this will do 000 in \\nabout 7.1 seconds but what will it actually do we\\'re actually in a slight decline here so that should kind \\nof balance out the fact that we\\'re both pork chops what\\'s your guess i guess that\\'s a good ques tion i \\nthink i think we\\'ll do it in 7.4 seconds i think 7.98 ooh oddly specific all right let\\'s go hey foot on the \\nbreak no well i don\\'t even know why let\\'s go oh yeah instant talk baby oh yeah oh oh oh that\\'s better \\nyeah i just took that took me a second 0-100 in 7.05 seconds i\\'ll take that man that\\'s pretty good slight \\ndecline but heavy boys all right let\\'s get into how this thing drives when you\\'re not being an idiot by the \\nway bro that\\'s a nice hoodie you\\'re wearing thanks man i actually got it from a r eally cool store called \\nmatt brand cars we don\\'t even know we don\\'t know the name of the website what\\'s the website i\\'ll put \\nit up here now all right so here we are driving the i was about to say bmw the mini i\\'m so tired bro \\nfreudian all right it happens to the best of half of the best of us the mini cooper s e s for s e for electric \\ni\\'ve got the windows down by the way because i\\'m too scared to do it on the air con because we\\'re in \\nthe country i don\\'t know if we\\'ll make it home but let\\'s give this thing s ome source oh sprightly it\\'s \\ndecent but it slows down once it gets to about a hundred so this thing is electronically limited to 150 \\nkilometers an hour not that you\\'ll i could ever be going 150 kilometers an hour in this thing unless \\nyou\\'re on the autobahn  but you\\'ll run out of range pretty damn quick if you do that maybe it\\'s too loud \\nokay i\\'m gonna risk it for the biscuit so actually my range just dropped four kilometers so i guess that\\'s \\nall right we just drove out here like for the car was at 90 we\\'re n ow at 75 we\\'ve been driving for maybe \\n20 minutes and i\\'ve been driving in green mode i put the car in green to make the car more efficient and \\nso no joke this car has just given me a lot of range anxiety that i haven\\'t experienced in other evs \\nbecause i\\'ve  got 450 60 kilometers of range like this is always ever present in my mind like will i make it \\nhome can you tell by the way the review\\'s going yeah but let\\'s talk about how it drives otherwise so \\nwhen you\\'re just cruising along the highway you have fixed dampers which means that they\\'re not \\nadaptive but it\\'s actually pretty damn comfortable definitely on the sporty side yeah but it\\'s good the \\nsteering itself is pretty heavy no matter what mode you\\'re in when you put it into sport mode that \\nmeans it does ad d quite a lot of weight to the steering wheel but in a good way and i\\'ll show you what i \\nmean when we get to saucy corner this is actually the original saucy corner you haven\\'t seen it yet no \\nwe go to saucy quarter too usually saucy cherry popping the sauc y cherry no joke i\\'m filming back in the \\nold location which i don\\'t like as much because there\\'s you know more traffic but that\\'s because this \\nwouldn\\'t make it no joke to where we were filming where we usually film you make it one way it make \\nit one way wo uldn\\'t make it back so that kind of sucks but anyway i\\'m going on about the range but \\nthat\\'s because that\\'s kind of the biggest drawback of this car yeah in terms of power though you put \\nyour foot down it goes it really does go it\\'s a very quick car so let \\'s put the car into there\\'s three modes \\nsport mid and green there\\'s also a green plus which turns off air con it\\'s pretty funny let\\'s put the car \\ninto sport mode literally has a go -kart for its icon and the range dropped it did just drop it just knows it \\npre-empts yeah it\\'s just so surreal oh yeah that we\\'re going quite quick and all you can hear is the chair \\nkind of creaking yeah i know which is a good thing actually because it\\'s very quiet within here you can \\nthank the fact that this does kind of have lik e luxury car underpinnings and you\\'ve also got nice soft \\nmaterials everywhere that helps to soak up a lot of the road noise and when you put it into sport mode \\nthe accelerator just goes like one to one meaning like you put your foot down a little bit and l ike it just \\ngoes this thing handles pretty amazingly well you\\'ll see a lot of reviewers not actually taking this thing \\non the twisties because they can\\'t make it out there and really that\\'s not what this car is for let me tell \\nyou it\\'s pretty fun on the tw isties wow it\\'s very flat as well you can thank the battery for that because in \\nthe floor so you know this car\\'s center of gravity is really low lower than any other mini but let me slow \\ndown here to give a bit of space between me and the car in front and there\\'s a few twisties here so it\\'s \\npretty amazing the wheels don\\'t scrabble i\\'m not sure if there\\'s a diff like a limited slip diff between \\n\\nthem but i wouldn\\'t be surprised because it puts down power really well like it\\'s genuinely very \\nimpressive how this thing drives and we did the m240i recently and that was amazing but this the fact \\nthat this still feels good compared to that yeah that\\'s t rue yeah we literally just came out of that yeah \\nswapped it over hats off mini bmw really no that\\'s not fair i\\'m sure they have like mini specific but you \\nknow they had a meeting about it they had they had a corporate meeting about it we know that much \\nzoom chat yeah oh this is saucy corner we\\'re coming up just as you go on a friend it\\'s time so we gotta \\ncome to a start this saucy corner isn\\'t quite as good as last order so four second but it\\'s just yeah it\\'s a \\nit\\'s a corner of source right you ready all ri ght here we go this is the first corner oh oh oh i felt the back \\ncome around there a little bit yeah under and over it was a bit of under an oversteer that was quite \\nweird look this thing is actually quite a lot of fun to drive it\\'s holding that line reall y well that\\'s \\nimpressive wow that is impressive okay all right all right i i think i get it i think i get this car coming it\\'s \\nlike when are you going to be out here though yeah well you\\'re not because you\\'re going to be scared to \\nget home it\\'s really good  though i think i think i\\'ve figured this car out though to me this car is the \\nperfect city car it\\'s the it\\'s the car you have when you\\'re in like paris right it\\'s when you want to go to \\npoint a point b shops in style in comfort it is quite comfortable it\\' s just that range it really it really ruins it \\nfor me you know like 180 kilometers on a good day i don\\'t know man i\\'ve been driving this car pretty \\ncivil and in green mode most of the time not right now not right now though and you know like it\\'s i \\ndon\\'t k now handling is very good though it does it does i know it\\'s so cliche it\\'s disgustingly cliche but it \\ndoes handle like it\\'s on rails people call it a hot hatch and again i want to reiterate that that is ridiculous \\nit doesn\\'t have the emotion of a hot hatc h i don\\'t feel like i\\'m you know like this fighting with the car \\nyeah or like doing much it\\'s almost like on easy mode because it handles so well thanks to the battery \\nbeing low um the regen braking is what\\'s stopping me there i i have not put my foot on t he brake once \\nbecause the regen is is really good i don\\'t know man i\\'m in two minds i\\'m in two mines this car is good \\nvery very good drives amazingly well but you don\\'t get to drive it for very long and there\\'s a lot of \\nanxiety with it i\\'m now down to 98 k ilometers like that probably two kilometers there and back is just \\nbecause of the way we were driving it\\'s used about 15 k\\'s of range yeah that\\'s not awesome and now \\nthis chair creaking is starting to annoy me all right let\\'s get into my final thoughts all  right so what are \\nmy final thoughts on the mini cooper sc i think early on in my career i made the mistake of being like i \\ndon\\'t like it because it\\'s got these floors therefore no one will like it there is definitely a market for this \\ncar it is just for p eople who are doing you know short trips you can\\'t go for example an hour out of \\nmelbourne you won\\'t make it home i\\'m not even joking like there\\'s like there\\'ll be nowhere to charge \\nyou\\'re not going to make it home so this is the kind of car that if you li ve in a small area and you want to \\ngo ev you want a really good looking car and you\\'re happy to spend the money it\\'s kind of perfect for \\nthat but for me i would just go and buy myself a tesla model 3. personally that\\'s just me but let me \\nknow what you guys  think of the mini cooper s e would you buy one would you spend the 70 grand to \\nget yourself the mini cooper s e mini yours [Applause] multi -tone roof as this one is called let me know \\nin the comment section just below that like button thank you guys very much for watching and as \\nalways i don\\'t know why i did that i\\'ll see you next week ciao for now  \\n \\nCar Model : 2022 Mini Cooper SE  \\nReview:  this episode of out of spec reviews is brought to you by magna more on that later hello and \\nwelcome to another out of spec review my name is mike if you listen to and or watch our out of spec \\nmotoring podcast then you will recognize me this is the first vi deo that i\\'m filming for out of spec and \\nthe reason for that is this car right here behind me that is my 2022 mini cooper sc i\\'ve owned it for \\nabout six months now so it\\'s gonna be a six month uh owners review and i\\'m mainly setting out to \\nanswer d o i regret buying this car which is the shortest range ev on sale uh six months into ownership so \\n\\nlet\\'s go find out and here it is my 2022 mini cooper s e the fully electric mini and also the shortest range \\nev on the market with just an epa estimated 112 miles of range just look at it uh this color is called \\nbritish racing green uh i remember seeing th is color on the 60th anniversary uh mini which i think came \\nout in 2019 is when they first launched this color super happy that they kept it around for me to be able \\nto order it so this trim that i got is a signature plus trim in the mini world that would make this the mid \\ntrim spec it starts with a signature at twenty nine thousand nine hundred dollars and then the signature \\nplus which i believe after destination fee is a little more than thirty four thousand i think it\\'s like thirty \\nfour thousand eight hu ndred and fifty dollars which would make sense because mine stickered for thirty \\nfive thousand dollars on the nose because i got one optional extra everything else was free or free \\nincluded in your thirty five thousand dollars i should say so this green re gistration green just looks \\nabsolutely amazing in the sun really highlights the body lines of this car absolutely love the metallic in it \\nsuper eye -catching i get a ton of compliments on this thing everyone loves the color and the two -tone \\nlook i specifica lly avoided a green roof and went with the white roof as many should be i think mini \\nshould have white roofs they just look amazing and i think the most amazing thing of this car is my one \\noptional extra the roof rails i remember when i had my last mini wh ich i also ordered new from the \\nfactory that car did not have roof rails and ben and kyle both gave me an extremely hard time for not \\nordering roof rails so i was sure to not let them down again and made sure that i got the roof rails \\nbefore i even told th em that i had ordered the car officially the wheels that i chose are not the power \\nspoke wheels aka corona wheels from back in 2020 these wheels are called pedal spoke wheels i\\'ve \\nactually not seen another sc with these wheels on them yet so kind of makes mine a little more unique i \\nthink and for 2022 the car was updated with this new front end which looks so much better than the old \\none in my opinion i love this body colored grill really really sets it off i absolutely love the green how it \\nfits in with th e chrome and the black accents for the signature plus the only difference really between \\nthe signature clutch and iconic the iconic trim is the most expensive mini that you could buy uh it does \\nget the blacked out trim on the outside so all this chrome her e all the chrome around the taillights back \\nhere will be black i do kind of wish i had the black trim or at least they made it optional but i guess they \\nhad to differentiate the car somehow and of course like all minis it has the union jack tail lights i k now \\nthat these are kind of divisive amongst a lot of people i really love them no is no complaints from me \\nand really the only way you can tell that this car is an electric car is this badge this uh mini electrified \\nbadge and the cooper s here the s\\'s on t his car are in like this yellow green color uh very cool this is the \\ncharge port as you can see it has the same symbol click it open up and as you can see yes this mini has \\ndc fast charging uh excuse the cleanliness of my charge port it is pollen season he re and now i realize \\nwhere it\\'s all gone whenever i wash the car so that\\'s kind of interesting but anyway let\\'s get these back \\nin here and shut that you join me back at the office with these incredible views to thank magna now \\nmagna is a technology company  that produces not only parts for cars but also technological solutions \\nfrom manufacturing and design and engineering they cover so many parts of the automotive sector and \\ni bet you\\'ve interacted with a magna product in your life before magna actually is v ery near and dear to \\nmy heart because their partnership magnustya in austria produced my first car a mini countryman and it \\nwas built right there in gratz a lot of you are also familiar magna is going to be producing the fiskar \\nocean in their magnustyre fa ctory and they also build g -wagons and nothing gets tougher than a g so \\nreally excited about our partnership with magna of course they are also hiring for engineers so we know \\na lot of you guys are super interested in technology and automotive i\\'ll leave a  link below so you can \\nlearn more about possible opportunities at magna but of course we want to thank them for sponsoring \\ntoday\\'s video and being such a huge supporter of out of spec truly they are pushing mobility forwards \\nresponsibly and sustainably so that\\'s just a really quick overview of my mini the one that i decided to \\norder um as i ordered it um really again really love this color super happy with it on the outside and \\nalmost more happy on the inside i mean just look at those seats talk about like tweed british jackets like \\nthat just works absolutely love this leatherette cloth combination with i\\'m going to use a porsche term \\n\\nhere deviated stitching included didn\\'t have to pay extra for that porsche i think charges you like 600 to \\ndo that overall super happy with the quality of this car too i have zero squeaks and rattles the sunroof is \\nsuper solid the seats don\\'t squeak at all  unlike ben\\'s ticon overall just a really really great car i\\'m super \\nhappy with it let\\'s shut the door next we\\'re just going to hop back inside and i\\'m really just going to \\nattempt to answer my question do i regret buying this little thing i don\\'t think th e answer will surprise \\nyou okay so back to the original question i posed do i regret buying the mini cooper se and the simple \\nanswer is no i have no regrets at all i absolutely love this little car it\\'s stupid fun to drive you can zip \\naround everywhere it feels plenty fast it feels a lot faster than my old mini cooper s just because most \\nelectric cars do due to instant torque as we know i just think the value for this car is where it\\'s at so 35 \\n000 plus a full 7 500 tax refund from the federal government if  you live in a state where you get state \\nincentives this car is even cheaper unfortunately north carolina doesn\\'t offer any state incentives which \\nis a miss on their part i think they should i think all states should but regardless this is still a very low  \\nlevel of ev ownership to get into and like i said earlier if you can charge at home every night then you \\ncertainly should never worry about the range on this car i don\\'t even charge every night like i said i \\ncharge once a week if that and i just think for  the driving experience for an ev it drives exceptionally well \\nit drives just like a standard mini cooper and those are the standard ice mini coopers are so fun to drive \\nwhether you get the three cylinder or the four cylinder turbos no regrets at all love this little car i think \\nwhen the day comes right do you end up selling it i\\'m going to miss it just like i missed my 2017 mini but \\nthere you go i highly recommend if you are in the market for an affordable fun to drive well -built \\ncomfortable ev then you de finitely need to shortlist this mini the mini cooper sc highly recommend it \\nand i will see you all next time you  \\n \\nCar Model : 2022 Mini Cooper SE  \\nReview:  [Music] hey guys welcome back to a new video i guess this week is the week of electric mini city \\ncars and today i have with me the mini cooper s i electric and in this video i will make the full review \\ninterior exterior i will try to show you every single detail about this mini cooper si and yeah of course in \\nthe end i will give you the conclusion before we go forward and start the review i want to give you some \\ntechnical data i want to tell you that i\\'m right here at auto fake here in switzerland i n burn i will leave \\nthe link in the description if you are around switzerland check them out guys they have great price also \\ntell them you see my video you come from me and you will get a nice discount as i said mini cooper s i \\nfree doors also the car come  with a few few extra options that you can see it right here for example the \\ncomfort plus package 900 francs navigation connect plus 900 francs it comes also with the driving \\nassistant plus 1 600 extra piano black exterior you will see in a moment when we go outside i will show \\nyou also and you can see the exterior design look phenomenal in this color with the black glossy it\\'s a \\ngreat combination 400 extra i think you totally deserve classic trim i\\'m not sure what it\\'s about here \\n1000 francs and all those options together will cost you 4 800 francs normally the starting price is 37 \\n900 francs and with all these options the price will go to 42 700 francs this is the price of the car a little \\nbit bigger but yeah if you are on the market for a sporty mini city  car uh electric this might be one for \\nyou in my opinion it has the best driving feeling from all the cars in this class because it bring that bmw \\nfeeling on the steering on the ground it\\'s just super super sporty now going forward another cool uh \\ninterest ing information is that the car come with 1560 kilograms also 15.8 kilowatt hour is the \\nconsumption and it\\'s in a class efficient class of course now let me give you some deeper technical \\ndetails and let me tell you that the power of the car it\\'s a front w heel drive so the motor it\\'s in the front \\nit comes with 184 horsepower 270 newton meters it\\'s more than enough it\\'s one of the most powerful \\nmini electric car in this class and it\\'s really really powerful check out the test drive i will have a separate \\nvideo with it with the test drive there i talk a little bit more about the driving feeling also the car comes \\n\\nwith a one -speed automatic transmission like all electric cars not all almost all electric cars because \\nsome of them they have dual transmission and that\\'s also super sporty and very expensive cars but \\nmost of them come with one speed automatic transmissio n the boot trunk capacity 211 liters if you fall \\ndown the seats completely 731 liters also the maximum speed of the car 150 kilometer per hour zero to \\n107.3 seconds the performance of the car are very very good the car it\\'s also created special for sporty \\ndriving so that\\'s why i tell you in my opinion is the best sporty car in this class now another important \\nthing is that the battery it\\'s 32.6 kilowatt hour but the usable battery capacity is 28.9 kilowatt hour it\\'s a \\n350 volt a lithium battery also the ran ge of the car vltp estimated 234 kilometers the turning radius of \\nthe car 10.7 meters also the car come with independent multi -link suspension on the rear and also \\nindependent spring strut mech person suspension on the front ventilated brake discs on the f ront and \\nbreak this on the rear also the car that i have with me it comes with 17 -inch rims that are fit super nice \\non the car and they look just perfectly now those are the most important information also i will add \\nsome information as we go in the video guys let\\'s start the review exterior interior and in the end we \\nwill make the conclusion all right guys let\\'s start the review here is the key of the car very interesting key \\nkind of unique i should say what you can do with the key you can lock and unlock the car uh and also \\nunlock the trunk nothing crazy nothing special it\\'s just a simple key as you can see from here also uh the \\ncar come with keyless entrance it has a little little button right here and when you press it you can lock \\nthe car and unlock the  car that\\'s something to keep in mind other than that you can see the quality of \\nthe doors guys because the door come with frameless window the same as honda e and also stezla \\nmodel freecom you can hear when you when you close the doors you can see that th e window will go a \\nlittle bit upper and today it\\'s winter it\\'s very cold outside and sometimes the window will stay stuck \\nwhen outside it\\'s very very cold and ice so you have to pay attention what you should do it\\'s here on \\nthose rubbers you you should put  some kind of special cream for the winter and in this way it will not \\nget frosty in the winter time that\\'s that\\'s a tip for you guys other than that what i notice is that they put \\na lot of quality here a lot of rubbers around here and here so uh we will s ee also in the test drive video \\nhow is the the sound insulation but overall it is quite good quality and also when you close the door you \\ncan hear that that quality uh made by a bmw car i should say anyway this is with the key let me turn on \\nthe lights and  then we will talk a little bit about the exterior design all right guys now the exterior design \\nof the car it\\'s like a minute still keep that shape of mini cooper uh i like it very much for the city it has \\nkind of this the perfect shape and the perfect si ze and the fact that it\\'s a little bit square as you can see \\nhere in the back it\\'s allow you to have even more space for the back passengers and we will see in a \\nmoment when we go inside uh but in terms of design it\\'s quite beautiful i like the design i li ke that they \\nuse those 17 -inch rims on the car i think they fit perfectly they look really really good in this shape in this \\nsize i just love them also the car come with the ventilated brake this on the front i think you can see it \\nright there also the the  discs are a little bit rusty here in the back we have only brake discs so no drum \\ndrums or stuff like that they\\'re a little bit rusty because as you know most of the cars electric cars \\nthey\\'re not braking with the disc they are braking with the motor it h as this regenerative brake so that \\nmake the discs last a little bit longer but anyway overall those 17 -inch rims look just perfect with the car \\nstand out a little bit make it look sportier and make it look aggressive i should say and nicer i think not \\nonly  the girls can drive this car like i heard a lot of people even boys and boys and men can drive this car \\nbecause it looks good it looks aggressive it looks nice it has beautiful shapes even if you look from the \\nfront it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s quite quite nice i don\\'t  know about you but i like the way they design it really nice shape \\nalso this gray color it\\'s beautiful i see that bmw use it also on the other cars like the new m2 i see the \\nsame color this gray look just gorgeous gorgeous on the car guys and also it\\'s in  two colors you can see \\nthat the roof it\\'s black and also the a pillar down here it comes this beautiful gray beautiful round \\nshapes here in the front even the hood you can see how nice shape it has also they add this fake vent \\nelement here that make the c ar much more aggressive the mini logo it\\'s nice in black you can see it \\nreally beautiful this black combination with gray even the glossy glossy black plastic around the head \\n\\nlamps on the grill here we have again this glossy black plastic pretty pretty nice and clean design in the \\nfront we have some air intakes to allow the air to cool down different parts there down here the same \\nnow they are closed we have some clappers that are closed right now but they will open in the hot \\nweather so it allows more air to go inside to pull down different parts there down here also the bumper \\nit\\'s quite sporty uh and nice we have some air intakes here on the side so you can see that the air c ome \\ninside here and then go outside around the wheel right here so it\\'s quite nice in my opinion it looks \\nreally really good also on the both sides the same story aggressive beautiful looking car now here guys \\non the tail lights uh you can see that we have  full led the high beam the low beam led the turning signals \\nled and also the daylights it\\'s in the same place with the turning signals also led light and uh it looks \\nquite quite nice really nice also the s right here from cooper s and this is the s i beca use it\\'s electric it\\'s \\nit\\'s at the eye also on the on the name going here uh also you can see this chrome design the way they \\nadd it around the car it\\'s really interesting this is all over around the car we have this chrome kind of \\nsignature nice design uh  it makes the car stand out a little bit more then here on the windshield we have \\na camera and sensors for raining and light the camera for reading the traffic speed limit also helps with \\nthe lane assist other than that here on the boat side we have the tu rning signals on the body of the car \\nyou have also again this s that looks wonderful and some black glossy element with some matte plastic \\nquite nice the mirror are also in black the same as the roof they are quite big so you have a good \\nvisibility even th ough the car doesn\\'t come with blind spot technology the mirrors are relatively big so \\nyou have a good visibility also the windows are big so you don\\'t have to worry in terms of visibility the \\nhandles they also design it in black glossy so it will kind of stand out on the body of the car also another \\ncool thing that i like they did on the car is that they add this plastic mat all over around the car you can \\nsee on the downskirt you can see here in the front where a lot of stones occur so everywhere around \\nthe wheels of the car we have this plastic that means the car is protected the paint and the body of the \\ncar is protected from scratch stones whatever it\\'s happening in the city most of the time a lot of \\nscratches occur in this area so you don\\'t have to rep aint the car just change those plastics it\\'s much \\nfaster and nicer six sensors in the front i like that not many small cars have six sensors parking sensors \\nand all that um sensors that help the car then in the back also four parking sensors not six they d idn\\'t \\nhave space where to put them so there are only four parking sensors on the rear here we have the fog \\nlamps normal bolt light on the fog lamps also the down part of the bumper in the back look nice look \\nsporty on the upper side we have cooper s again led light here the taillights quite nice even the blinkers \\non the both sides you can see it also from the distance it looks really good here we have a reverse \\ncamera also led lights on the number plate again this mini logo and up here the roof spoiler agai n quite \\nsporty uh and nice i like the way it looks i like the way it stand out a little bit in the back the radio \\nantenna is something that i wish to be different it\\'s kind of big i don\\'t know why they didn\\'t add it some \\nkind of a small glossy plastic but other than that it\\'s relatively fine also i think the car would look much \\nbetter with some tinted windows here on the rear yeah anyway those are small details here is the \\ncharging port on the right side so you can charge the car at dc and ac and also the m aximum charging \\nspeed is 49 kilowatt hour in dc this is it guys this is the exterior of the car i don\\'t know if i missed \\nsomething i think i cover almost everything it\\'s a small beautiful sporty car and and in my opinion this is \\nthe best sporty car in this  super mini class this is my opinion the best sporty car in terms of driving \\nfeeling check out the test drive guys there i talk a little bit more about the driving feeling and you will \\nsee a little bit more uh why i\\'m telling you this is the best sporty ca r in this class it\\'s it\\'s really bring that \\nbmw feeling to the car that crazy sporty that you are close to the ground anyway check out the test \\ndrive even the hood is designed in a bmw way so you don\\'t have to find something here or get dirty on \\nyour hand you just pull it up like that you have an automatic liftgate in the front here another good uh \\nquality feature that the car come with it\\'s a front wheel drive so the motor is in the front that\\'s \\nsomething to keep in mind here we have a big plastic with min i logo on it nothing nothing to see here \\nuh also we have the fluid cooling fluid there is the 12 volt battery and here is the liquid for the wipers \\n\\nanyway that\\'s it guys going in the trunk open the trunk from here it\\'s a manual lift gate in the trunk and \\nhere is the trunk now the car come also with this uh protection right here small protection i will take it \\nout and i will show you how it looks witho ut it this is the trunk here at the beginning we have some \\nplastic guys also the great thing is that this floor can be adjusted you can leave it like this you have like \\nfive centimeter here maybe seven centimeter or you can take it out and put it uh straig ht let me show \\nyou it\\'s quite hard to do that with one hand put it here and you have a flat floor you have a completely \\ncompletely flat floor and this is this is awesome this is a great feature down here the the other cool \\nfeature is that you can put this protection just like that it has a plastic here that hold it in place and now \\nyou can see that you can you have even more space down here it\\'s really really deep i like that also you \\nhave the cables that come standard with the car to charge it at home or t o charge it with ac at public \\ncharging stations you have some hooks in the corners that also good and other than that this is the \\nspace relatively good i find it uh very useful and also this floor here i find it\\'s super super useful and you \\nhave a lot of s pace there you can also adjust it down the way you want it also the car let\\'s don\\'t forget \\nthat comes with a 12 volt board right here normal light here uh normal halogen light and yeah other \\nthan that this is the trunk let me take out the protection and th en we will fall down the seats all right \\nguys i just take out that protection so you can take a look one more time the entrance in the trunk it\\'s \\nhuge it\\'s relatively huge i like the way they design it also you have a flat floor here and that\\'s a good \\nthing now if you want to fall down the seats all you have to do is just pull these levers here on the side \\njust like that and then push it forward then you will have a flat floor a completely flat floor this is again \\nanother cool practical feature i like the w ay it looks i think you can fit inside here a lot of stuff for the \\nsize of the car it\\'s it\\'s relatively perfect nothing to say about that also uh the great thing is that you can \\neven put the floor a little bit down so if you need more space it\\'s great that  you can adjust it or you can \\nactually take it out completely so that\\'s that\\'s also another cool thing let me put it down to show you \\nhow it would look also with it down just like that so you will have some kind of extra 10 centimeters \\nthere uh if you will  put it down so yeah relatively nice also if you go on the side let me go here on the \\nside let me show you if you want to fold this seat down you have a handle up here in the back and then \\njust push it forward and then you can check out one more time the s pace from here you can see the \\nentrance it\\'s it\\'s huge and then the great part you have a flat floor and also it left behind the seats some \\nstorage space there where you can put different different stuff the quality behind the seats here is very \\nvery good anyway this is the space guys um i hope you make an idea now i will put everything back and \\nthen we will go inside the car to see the other space and the technology okay before we go forward i \\nforget to tell you that up here on the door you have the triang le so yeah also handle to close the um the \\ntrunk anyway let\\'s go here forward the entrance here you have a huge door it\\'s it\\'s perfect and also the \\nentrance behind this front seat it\\'s very big so you can go inside there in the back without any problem \\nnow  here is the handle this is how easy you can fold it forward now you can see in the back there you \\nhave a lot of space and also what i notice is that the windows are very big on the on the rear and you \\nhave gorgeous visibility those are the seats a combina tion between leather and fabric material they look \\ngood they are big enough even for bigger persons to stay there without any any problem also you can \\nsee the stitches the leather here in the middle you have kind of an arm rest or support i don\\'t know it\\'s  \\nsmall you don\\'t have any armors in the middle or cup holders the cup holders are here on the side also \\nyou have a speaker and here we have plastic so no soft material in this area everywhere here in this \\narea it\\'s plastic that\\'s something to keep in mind but you have ease of fix for child you can install two \\nchild seats in the back and you can install another child seat in the front guys so keep in mind that you \\ncan install it also in the front so that\\'s another cool thing that i see most of the people use  it in those \\ncars let me go inside here in the back let me check out the space so being here in the back you have a \\ncup holder in the middle another one that\\'s good also here it\\'s no light on the roof but the roof quality \\nit\\'s very very very good also you have some hooks right here for some jacket or something like that now \\nbeing here on the seats as i said they are big enough i sit before in in a seat in the back here and i have \\n\\nto tell you that it\\'s really really comfortable you have also this big window so you have great visibility \\nbetter than in four -door cars sometimes in some cars four fingers maybe five fingers over my head \\nother than that it\\'s very very comfortable here not hing to say guys i mean i i sit really really well because \\nof the shape of the car as i said before you have a lovely lovely position here even if you pull down the \\ndriver seat this is my driving position by the way and this is a little bit more backward a nd you can see \\nhow much space i have on my knee 173 centimeters it\\'s my height so in case you want to know this is \\nthe space if you want to fold it forward you do it like that also you have some storage space here with \\nleather yeah it\\'s pretty nice pretty nice the space it\\'s really really good anyway now we will go in the \\nfront guys we will talk a little bit about the dashboard and the design in the front but overall i have to \\ntell you that i like very much this uh unique design of the mini the way mini des ign the head -up display \\ncockpit and also this multimedia system it\\'s really cool and it\\'s a nice uh young design and and i like it\\'s \\nvery simple for for a city car it\\'s just more than you need anyway let\\'s go in the front here in the front as \\ni said before  frameless windows uh going to the door design of the door it\\'s quite nice also pretty pretty \\nmodern then we have soft material on the upper side here everywhere soft material then you have this \\nglossy glossy plastic that looks quite nice also here you hav e soft material you have an ambient light \\ninside here you can see i don\\'t know if you can see it\\'s a bar an led light bar in the nighttime look good \\nso soft material here soft material here on the armrest uh the only plastic part it\\'s down here in this \\narea here we have some storage space it\\'s not that big but yeah it\\'s okay better than that nothing then \\nyou have the buttons in chrome really interesting the way they design those buttons then you have the \\nfolding mirrors you can also fold it if you press thi s button and then you have the electric adjustable \\nmirrors from here you can adjust it electrically this is the handle quite cool look at this how nice it is \\nreally interesting when you open it you open it with this lock and unlock buttons really interesti ng and \\nalso the quality of it it\\'s very good you have a small speaker here and then at the entrance you have this \\nmini cooper s i like very much displayed look really fancy other than that normal pedals really \\ninteresting design on the pedals they are norm al you can see also the seats in the front fabric material \\nseats combination with leather they are big they are bright so even big people can sit on them as i said \\nin the back in the front the same story very good quality a lot of side support here they ar e super sporty \\nthey hold you really really good here in the seat and also the quality in the middle this fabric material \\nsits it\\'s really really good and if i\\'m not wrong this is made by recycled materials if i remember well also \\nhere in the front you can adjust this uh part you have manual adjustments for the seat so overall it\\'s \\nsimple to use here guys keep in mind that you have the fog lamp button and you have those lights \\nadjustment buttons that you can do it from here quite nice quite simple and also t he brightness and all \\nthat stuff here in this area we have plastic then we go to the vents also quite nice vents very good \\nquality as you touch them uh they feel quite quite good glossy plastic around here also on the upper \\nside we have soft material you c an see right here kind of a rubber everywhere on the dash it\\'s soft soft \\nmaterial anyway let\\'s go inside going inside close the door also the quality of the doors it\\'s very good \\nthey sound really really good visibility around the windows perfect huge huge windows on the side good \\nvisibility in the mirror good visibility around the windows also as you probably know the mini minis car \\nhave this round round round round round shape on the windows and the windows are a little bit higher \\nthis a -pillar it\\'s someho w designed to be a little bit upper and in this way they they make this uh window \\na little bit straighter and you have a different unique feeling here where you can even straight your \\nhands until you go to the a -pillar you have a lot of space here in the c abin i like that i like this this feeling \\nwhere we are inside the car and also as you can see the window is also a little bit round like in a \\nspaceship it\\'s it\\'s cool i don\\'t can see it on the camera but it\\'s really interesting also good visibility in this  \\nmirror in the back because you have that big straight window there on the side perfect visibility this car \\nhas no blind spots so you can see perfect around the windows you can see one more time the seats in \\nthe back here in the middle you have an armrest something that not all the mini cars have i mean from \\nother companies also you have a telephone place here you can put it up you have some storage space \\n\\ndown here the center console although is made by plastic it\\'s very simple to use and easy to reach the \\nbuttons that\\'s important also it\\'s pretty sunny outside if you want to start the engine this is the start the \\nengine you press it like that just like tha t and you start the engine it\\'s really cool really unique then you \\ngo here press this button go in drive down and now you\\'re driving and let\\'s go a little bit further it \\ncomes with electric uh break as well let\\'s go a little bit forward where is no more su nny just like that \\nhere it\\'s perfect press the p in park good now what i said is that it\\'s easy to reach those buttons here \\nand this is great this is the controller for the multimedia system here the same as in the bmw you have \\nthe same kind of controllers  also electronic handbrake this is the stalk it\\'s perfectly positioned very easy \\nto use press the button forward backward just like that it\\'s super simple it\\'s very good positioning then \\nyou have two cup holders here some storage space usb 2 usbc a 12 volt  port down there very useful and \\nthen you go a little bit higher here you have these parking sensors button look how nice you activate \\nthis activate them just press them then you have also this button here you probably wonder what is this \\nthis is the recov ery the energy recovery so if you look on the screen you go high recovery or low \\nrecovery so yeah this is something that you should choose for yourself this is star stop engine button uh \\nreally interesting i like the way they design it then we have this bu tton traction control and this is \\ndifferent driving modes from here you change different driving modes so you can see also on the screen \\nyou have the green plus like echo plus like green like middle and like sport so you can choose from here \\nyou can see th e test drive video i explain you more about that in the video here\\'s the climatic system \\nyou have physical button here very easy to adjust the climatic system so everybody knows how to do \\nthat we have also heated seats for you and the passenger in the fron t the glow box is here quite big for \\nthe size of the car i find it really really big and useful more than enough for a car in this class now close it \\nhere in this area you have soft material everywhere in this area glossy plastic nice design also those \\nvents uh feel quite good as you touch it good quality on the vents uh also up here you have soft material \\nyou have the vents up here uh in a nice design i didn\\'t see that before another car but from here come \\nair directly to the windshield so it will defrost the windshield even faster and that\\'s a good good thing up \\nhere you have a microphone you don\\'t have any handle here but you have this mirror with two lights \\nright here protection for the sun up here again you have sos button let me zoom in a little bit so s button \\nyou have the lights here also quite nice the way they put it on this i like this idea with those buttons that \\nyou go forwards backward it\\'s quite interesting quite quite interesting now it comes also with a head -up \\ndisplay this is the thing that i  um i don\\'t like so much because the head -up display it\\'s on this plastic \\nglass there and it\\'s kind of disturbing i mean when you drive it doesn\\'t look so good was much better to \\nbe on the uh on the window but the great part is that you can deactivate it y ou can hide it inside and \\nyou will never see it and trust me when you drive the car you will notice that you don\\'t need a head -up \\ndisplay because you have such a good visibility here on the cockpit that the head -up display yeah it\\'s not \\nso uh useful i shou ld say but it\\'s a good extra first for some people that prefer it the steering wheel guys \\nlet me show you how you adjust it manual adjustment from behind you can adjust it forward backward \\nand this time when you go forward and backward the cockpit will sta y there but if you go up and down \\nyou can see the cockpit will come with you so that\\'s that\\'s interesting and then you close it from here \\nyou\\'ll lock it in place the quality of the steering wheel it\\'s it\\'s incredible i mean it\\'s leather you can see \\nthe sti tch is very good quality very good grip very nice size it\\'s perfect it feels sporty to be honest that\\'s \\nwhy i tell you is one of the best sporty car in this class because everything feels very sporty so the \\nsteering wheel is not crazy assisted it it gives you that bmw sporty feeling and i know many people love \\nthat and i like that sometimes as well and this is great i talk about that in the test drive video more so \\ncheck that video out here you have some buttons in glossy plastic for cruise control or that cruise \\ncontrol controllers are here and on the other side we have the controllers for the multimedia and yeah \\ndifferent different stuff behind the stalk here we have this bc button where you change and you can see \\nalso on the cockpit the consumption the ki lometer down there how much battery left and stuff like that \\nanyway and on the cockpit it\\'s great the cockpit guys it has a great brightness you can see in the \\n\\ndaytime you can see it very well also the multimedia system as well big nice you have everything there \\nthe car can read the traffic speed limit you can see how much range you have the temperature the \\nbattery here left 90 percent here you have you can see w hat happened with the energy it\\'s great it is do \\nthe job perfectly you have there in the front all the information that you need nothing crazy nothing \\nfancy but it\\'s a matte screen that mean even when it\\'s sunny outside you can see very very clear there \\nin the front let\\'s go to the multimedia system and i want to show you something really cool you see \\nthose lights here around this multimedia when you change the temperature or the the vent speed look \\nat this that light is changing as well and when you change  the temperature you go cold or warm it will \\nchange the color there look at this how cool is that i like that it\\'s really interesting how this light work \\nhere it\\'s a fancy fancy feature here in the middle we have the blinker button and also we have this \\nbutton for the safety feature so when you press this button it will get you to the menu where you can \\nsee this collision warning pedestrian alert lane departure warning you can configurate this as well here \\nso this is the front end collision warning early or  late or wherever you want to do it and it\\'s it\\'s cool it \\nhas all these safety features right here and you press this button you get directly there now the great \\nthing about this multimedia system is that can be controlled from down here so you don\\'t need to use \\nthe touchscreen even though if you want to use the touchscreen you can use it without any problem it\\'s \\nwork perfectly also here you have those kind of classic controllers from bmw from the multimedia i will \\nuse the controller it\\'s much more easier f or me guys to show you all so you have for example the menu \\nhere on the front and screen and on the menu let me zoom a little bit just like that on the menu you \\nhave the calendar here the second one you have the media multimedia where you have all that set tings \\nand radio and stuff like that then let me go back then you have the navigation it\\'s the navigation that \\nalso bmw use it it\\'s a little bit different in terms of design but it looks really really good you it works fast \\nas you can see it\\'s relatively re sponsive very responsive and that\\'s a good thing and also you have all the \\ncharging station here if you choose a route and you will see that it\\'s loading very fast this is one of my \\nfavorite thing that it\\'s loading really really fast and you don\\'t have to wait too much time so the \\nprocessing power behind it it\\'s very good now let\\'s go back also we have all the settings on the map i \\ndon\\'t want to go too much into details right now but you have a lot of settings on the map on the car \\nand yeah whatever it\\'s it \\'s really really deep anyway the second one it\\'s my mini on the my mini you \\nhave all the settings of the car like lightning doors key uh on the lightning you have interior light exterior \\nlights so on the interior light you have also the ambient light the b rightness of the ambient light you can \\nset it up the way you want it exterior light you can choose here welcome light and stuff like that door \\nkey settings how you want to locate intelligence safety here you have all that safety features that you \\nsee befor e speed limit assist speed warning parking on the parking again you have all these sensors and \\nuh configurate green that mean you choose here the green limit uh the speed limit for example and the \\ngreen control i\\'m not sure also what is this active auxilia ry climatic system here you can activate the \\nclimatic system when you depart or when you go you can schedule when you go on a particular time \\nyou can schedule from here vehicle tracking and yeah those are all here on the vehicle settings then you \\nhave syst em settings where you can change the language you can change the display uh brightness you \\ncan change the date and time the units kilometer mile uh bar and psi or whatever here\\'s the settings of \\nthe sound and then you have the notification pop -ups software  updates and all that stuff i will make a \\nseparate video with this multimedia system soon guys now going forward driver profile here you can \\nchoose your driver profile vehicle status is the car have some errors or stuff like that you will find it here \\nchec k control tire pressure yeah whatever all this all the the the service information are here so you will \\nfind it here technology in action e drive here you can see also a potential it will show you how much \\nkilometer you can save now the car have 167 range it stays there driver information computer board \\nand all that stuff it\\'s also very useful you can see also here all the info is about consumption um yeah let \\nme go back my mini and yeah those are on my mini the next one it\\'s mini connected here you can \\nconnect you can see that the car is connected to the internet you can see weather news and all kind of \\n\\ninformation that also bmw have it then notification those are kind of all the menu this is all the menu \\nguys so here you find all those information it\\'s really cool and very very very easy to to use it and to find \\ndifferent functions you can get used with it really  \\n \\nCar Model : 2022 Mini Cooper SE  \\nReview:  [Music] this is our 2022 mini cooper ac and this is my one month ownership review now this is \\nnot going to be an in -depth review in the mini cooper se there\\'s a million videos out there on the mini \\ncooper ac so i\\'m not going to waste your time with that ra ther a video on what it\\'s actually like to live \\nwith an electric mini pros and cons do i still love it do i hate it charging and most importantly the \\ncharging cost which i\\'ll show at the end of the video so let us begin with is it still fun well i\\' m guessing it \\nis still fun because i never get to drive it my wife tries it to work and when she\\'s not driving it my son \\nsteals it because it\\'s free for him he drives a bmw 328 and he loves the mini and it doesn\\'t cost him a \\npenny but from the little i\\'ve got to drive it yes i still love it i mean what\\'s not to love it\\'s faster than the \\naverage car in fact it\\'s faster than most cars it is better handling than pretty much every car other than \\nhigh performance sports cars and it\\'s virtually free to run i\\'ll g et to that later but yeah not having to \\nworry about fuel stops constantly i could do with that car it\\'s really great the auto regen feature is really \\nreally amazing if you don\\'t know what that is basically when you lift off the gas it automatically sends \\npower back into the battery there\\'s actually a little gauge on your dash and it tells you how much power \\nyou are gaining back so it\\'s kind of like a little game when you\\'re driving about you don\\'t want to touch \\nthe brake and that even means that you\\'re goin g to be saving wear and tear on your brake pedal as well \\nit\\'s really pretty clever nighttime driving is really great up front you have the big led circles for daytime \\nrunning lights and when it gets dark you\\'ve got very bright auto leveling led headlights super bright you \\nsee exactly where you\\'re going no danger there and obviously the rear you\\'ve got your nice union jack \\ntail lights which are both very bright and very distinctive so no one\\'s going to miss you so let\\'s talk about \\nwhat we don\\'t like about th e car this won\\'t take long there\\'s only a couple of things and they happen \\ninside the car the first thing we don\\'t like is the gear selector as you can see reverse is all the way \\nforward and drive is all the way back to us our heads want to move it forward  to go forward and \\nbackwards to go in reverse very small detail but it\\'s just a little bit annoying for us the second thing is \\nthe reversing camera now i\\'m sure you can switch that off or change the settings but it\\'s just super \\nparanoid about hitting thing s let me demonstrate so we have all our guidelines green and red and \\ndirections you\\'re going to go if you turn you\\'ve got this outside circle of light amber is like okay green is \\ngood etc etc red is bad so let me show you what happens when you get even jus t a little bit close to an \\nobject it\\'s freaking out so let\\'s go outside and we\\'ll see how close we are to stuff obviously tons of room \\nhere and i\\'m that far away and it\\'s doing a freak out so because i want to bring the car all the way back \\nto here it\\'s go ing to make that horrible paranoid beep all the way back in a straight line even though i\\'ve \\ngot all this space i mean it\\'s not the end of the world and i\\'m sure there\\'s settings maybe sensitivity \\nsettings i can change but it\\'s just a wee bit annoying when  you\\'re not used to having that audible alert i \\ndon\\'t mind you know a visual alert i can see you know i\\'ve got eyes but i don\\'t need the constant \\nbleeping freaking out i know it doesn\\'t want to scratch it\\'s lovely paint but but that\\'s it that\\'s the only \\ntwo things we can think of at the moment other than me not being able to drive it much because my \\nwife and my son are always driving it and obviously i\\'ve got other toys to play with as well not bad for a \\ndislike list while we\\'re in the garage or halfway in the garage let\\'s discuss running costs and charging \\nnow i\\'m going to base this on our level 2 charger which i\\'ll show you in a second and how much it\\'s \\ncosting per kilowatt hour and all that technical stuff i\\'ll break it down a bit this is our level two mi ni \\nelectric charger which we got with the car as part of the deal now if you are not a competent electrician \\nor a cheap scotsman like me get someone else to fit this and i\\'ll show you why this plug three pin plug is \\n\\nthe same as my welder i had the welder hooked up to a 30 amp breaker in the basement and the fuse \\nbox but i was told i would need a 40 amp to run this it\\'s a relatively low draw for the mini because it\\'s \\ngot a small battery and it requires 32 amps so you h ave to go up to a 40 amp breaker however the wire i \\nwas using for the welder looked like this it\\'s a two wire with uh with a ground okay this is not big \\nenough to run a 40 amp or a 32 amp charger i know this because i tried it because i\\'m a fill and i did \\nmonitor it and i did feel the wire start to heat up so don\\'t use that more importantly if you\\'re running a \\ndifferent type of electric car in the future it may require even more wattage like i know the teslas i think \\nthey go up to 60 amps that wire they jus t throw away that would actually burn say your housing fire \\neveryone dies it\\'s not a good story this is the wire you require for the 32 amp draw with the 40 amp \\nbreaker this is actually rated to 50 amps so even though it\\'s rated to 50 i still can run a tes la or like a f -\\n150 lightning off this wire it\\'s no good so be very careful if you\\'re doing it yourself make sure you \\nresearch or you know touch the wire after we put on and see if it\\'s burning your hand no seriously get \\nsomeone else to do it this wire is q uite expensive and here\\'s something else you need to know a lot of \\nnew homes that are getting built will be getting built with this wire going to a plug in the the garage or \\noutside specifically to future proof it because more more people will be buying el ectric cars so this wires \\nactually short supply so if you\\'re thinking about getting an electric car make sure you can get your wire \\nfirst this roll of 10 meters which was the smallest amount i could get was a 180 with tax shocking only \\nneeded three meters so i\\'ve got spare which means i can either sell it or route it around to somewhere \\nelse in the garage or take it to my next house who knows but be warned right charger -wise as i say this \\nis a three -pin plug the teslas and the bigger rampage wires uh cars a nd batteries will have a four pin \\nplug right do i get too technical this is the one that came with the charger so i know it\\'s good for a three \\nwire plug plug it in it goes that color i don\\'t know what it means it\\'s basically just preparing whatever\\'s \\ninsid e this big magic box turns orange and then it turns blue which means it\\'s good to go so let\\'s plug it \\ninto the car and see what happens just ram it in there and once that little light is flashing yellow means \\nit\\'s charging the box itself will pulse well no t the box the light will pulse also to show its charging and \\ninside the car it will tell you how long it will be to fully charged i mean it\\'s pretty much fully charged at \\nthe moment now here\\'s something important don\\'t charge it during the day charge it wh en it\\'s off peak \\nand i\\'ll go over that right now so how much does it cost to run an electric car for a week well my wife \\nand my son both work in a very similar location they\\'re only about a kilometer apart from each other so \\nthe distance is pretty much ide ntical however my wife uses the country roads and my son takes the \\nhighway is there a difference no apparently we live on this sort of level work is that level and there\\'s a \\nvalley in the middle so there is a bit of them gravity involved which helps with r egen the highway not so \\nmuch so my son doesn\\'t get the regen that i was talking about earlier like my wife gets so that maybe \\nthat\\'s why it balances out okay on to the cost so here\\'s a map of how far they go is a round -trip daily \\ncommute of about 80 kilome ters and here is how much it costs we are talking average of about 80 cents \\nto recharge it at night now what i was saying a little bit off -peak if you notice around a bit they are if you \\ncharge it before like seven o\\'clock obviously it\\'s going to be differ ent where you are but in canada after \\nseven o\\'clock is off peak if you charge it before then the price doubles i mean it\\'s not the end of the \\nworld it\\'s only like a dollar fifty instead of eighty cents to recharge it this is recharging it from about 70 \\nto fully charged we\\'ve never we\\'ve never taken the battery right down to to zero so we don\\'t know how \\nmuch that would cost but that gives you an idea and it\\'s all very similar per day or per evening how \\nmuch it costs so it\\'s virtually three if you imagine how  much a round trip of 80 kilometers would cost in \\nan average petroleum powered car it\\'d be considerably more than that so it\\'s cheap and it\\'s very \\ncheerful so wrapping things up any regrets on buying an electric money the only regret we have is we \\ndidn\\'t d o it you know it\\'s truly truly fantastic little car if you\\'re even considering one go for a test drive \\nbut make sure you take your bank details with you can pretty much guarantee you will leave the \\ndealership with a receipt for a brand new electric mini ri ght it\\'s a big time i went through a wee drive i \\n\\nrarely get to drive a thing so i\\'m away for a bit of fun take care everyone i\\'ll see you i\\'ll see you around \\nchristmas or something i don\\'t know i\\'ll see when i get back i might be away for a while um [Music] you  \\n \\nCar Model : 2021 Mini Cooper SE  \\nReview:  on this episode of evie ryder we\\'ve got a 12 000 mile long term review of our personal 2021 \\nmini cooper se ev we\\'ve had our mini coming up on a year and a half and here\\'s a spoiler alert we love it \\nanyone who follows many knows reviewers loved it with one glaring exception and that\\'s the range the \\n2021 mini had an epa estimated combined range of 108 miles per charge from its 32.6 kilowatt hour \\nbattery the good news here is many under promised but over delivered on the epa\\'s range estimate \\nwe\\'ve exce eded 108 miles multiple times with 5 or more of charge left doing primarily interstate travel \\nwhich the epa rated at 100 miles the usual ev caveats apply your range will vary depending on driving \\nspeed driving mode and weather conditions evs do see range l osses during the colder months although \\nthat\\'s not a concern most of the time here in sunny florida the cooper se\\'s limited range hasn\\'t slowed \\nus down we usually make a 215 mile round trip from jacksonville to new smyrna beach twice a month in \\nthe cooper sc our longest road trip so far has been 538 miles over the course of a three -day weekend \\nrather than take more of your valuable time to go over the specs of the mini here they are feel free to \\npause this video if you\\'d like to spend more time reading them  over likely because of the battery\\'s small \\nsize mini capped the dc charging rate at 50 kilowatts per hour it takes about a half hour to get from a \\nfive to eighty percent charge with a level three charger as with most tvs the sc\\'s charging speed slows \\ndown  dramatically after eighty percent to avoid damaging the battery so most road trippers only charge \\nup to eighty percent unless they need the full 100 to get to the next fueling stop now that we\\'ve got the \\nmini\\'s weak points out of the way here comes the go od news it\\'s every bit as fun to drive as a gas \\npowered mini maybe even more so on a level 2 7.4 kilowatt per hour home charger it takes under 5 \\nhours to fill the battery meaning you\\'ll leave the house each morning with a full charge it\\'s a great \\nfeeling n ever needing to make time for a gas station run on a busy day the electric cooper se feels as \\nlight on its feet as its turbo powered cooper s sister i recently had a chance to drive a new mini cooper s \\nconvertible with a six speed from a seat of the pants perspective the ev mini feels quicker since there\\'s \\nno turbo lag or rpm drop off during shifts as is the case with the manual mini motor trend measured a \\nsix second zero to 60 time on a 2020 se it tested mini\\'s famous go -kart handling remains in my opinion  \\nthe shorter range battery was an acceptable trade -off to keep the price and weight down build quality is \\nexcellent no squeaks or rattles have cropped up during our ownership the cooper se still feels as tight as \\nthe day we bought it the nearly white seats  and floor mats are also holding up nicely the only service \\nwe\\'ve done so far is a tire replacement after picking up a nail while it\\'s not showy the mini\\'s \\ninfotainment and ergonomics are excellent the mini center stack includes an optional 8.8 touch scree n \\nalthough you\\'ll probably seldom use the touch feature thanks to its jog dial setup and physical buttons \\nunlike the trend toward big touch screens controlling just about everything the mini\\'s jog dial and \\nbuttons will become muscle memory allowing you to quickly go from things like navigation to media \\nwithout taking your eyes off the road same thing for the climate control in our case we got a fully \\nloaded car so a heads up display is also a part of the package with redundant steering wheel controls \\nyou ca n quickly change channels without taking your eyes off the road while there is no adaptive cruise \\ncontrol available the traditional cruise is quick and easy to operate with steering wheel controls to \\nnudge the speed up or down alexa is on board for voice c ommands and in my experience does as good a \\njob with navigation commands as google assistant directions to the avenues mall processing your input \\navenues south side boulevard jacksonville florida say yes or select another entry from the list yes \\nguidance h as been started the built -in navigation isn\\'t perfect but it gets the job done with one silly faux \\npas in addition to showing charging stations it also displays gas stations many if you\\'re watching this it\\'s \\n\\ntime for an over -the-air update that removes those pesky gas stations the car has four modes sport mid \\ngreen and green plus the modes adjusts the throttle response and climate control in green plus there\\'s \\nno heating or ac just the fan the car defaults to mid mode which is the everyday mode one pedal driving \\nor coasting is also available with a quick toggle switch one of the wonderful things about one pedal \\ndriving is it basically simulates the feel of a downshift and sends regenerated power into the batter y as \\nwith most modern evs the cooper se comes with an app that can do things like precondition the car \\nremotely most importantly you can check charging progress remotely at the time of this video\\'s \\npublication the cooper sc didn\\'t have any direct competito rs in the u.s it\\'s the only available two -door \\nhot hatch ev currently being sold in the states if you want an open air ev the cooper se is also one of the \\nfew choices available there is a big trend toward fixed glass roof evs that don\\'t open but thankfully  mini \\nis bucking that trend offering a full glass sunroof that does open to take full advantage when nice \\nweather is in the forecast with the exception of range the cooper sc remains every bit as practical as its \\ngas powered cousin it has a more spacious b ack seat than the convertible i drove and the car\\'s rear \\nhatch has the same 34 square feet of storage space as a cooper s with the seats down given the mini \\ncooper is a sub compact you might be surprised to find out how much space there is in the back seat  i\\'m \\nfive foot eight and as you can see i still have headroom and i still have leg room keeping the seat right \\nnow where it is when i\\'m driving the mini one thing you don\\'t get is a frunk that area is taken up by the \\ncooper ses inverter and other electroni cs so don\\'t expect extra storage space because it\\'s an ev circling \\nback to the whole range thing can you really live with a car with a range of just over 100 miles in our \\ncase absolutely it\\'s our second car so for road trips in excess of say 150 miles one way in the day we\\'ll \\ntake the other car to avoid losing time to charge it we\\'ve done several overnight trips in the mini we \\nusually leave home with a full charge and then charge at our destination or if the trip is beyond the \\nmini\\'s range we plan a lunch s top or other break along the way for families with a second car the mini is \\na strong affordable option for one person or a family with a single car there are better options out there \\nalthough it will be tough to find one with as high a fun factor at the mi ni\\'s price point if you\\'re the type \\nof person that doesn\\'t do long road trips then a cooper sc still might work if you\\'ve got any questions \\nabout our many that i haven\\'t already answered go ahead and ask in the comments section on the \\nyoutube page and i\\'ll  be happy to try to answer your questions and if you\\'ve enjoyed this episode of vv \\nrider please go ahead and give it a like and subscribe so i can bring you more reviews and more \\nadventures about the people

\\ndays but mini is going in a very different direction with their full ev the 2021 mini cooper se this is a full \\nelectric mini cooper and in my opinion probably the best mini currently made right now but it\\'s not \\ngoing in the same direction as some of those other evs that are getting all the headlines range comes in \\nat 110 miles so definitely below the average tesla but thanks to its small size and low cur b weight fuel \\nefficiency in the real world is really good in this mini and the price tag is very low thanks to the small \\nbattery pack this comes in under thirty thousand dollars which means this is one of the least expensive \\nelectric vehicles available in the us and in my opinion this is the best mini period up front we get the \\nsame cheerful face as the rest of the mini lineup we get full led headlamps standard on the electric \\nversion fog lamps down there below there are a lot of yellow accents going on out side here and they\\'re \\nkind of a sort of greeny yellow accent it kind of reminds me of someone that has a sinus infection you \\ncan get the car without the yellow accents however so if you don\\'t like these don\\'t worry you can omit \\nthem and then we have little  electric plug icons located all around the vehicle since cooling is less of a \\nrequirement for an electric vehicle they don\\'t use this portion of the grille but oddly enough we still \\n\\nhave the hood scoop even though it doesn\\'t do anything although mini has given this a low sticker price \\ni\\'m a little bit disappointed when it comes to active safety this vehicle does have forward collision \\nwarning pedestrian detection and autonomous brakin g on it but we don\\'t have radar adaptive cruise \\ncontrol or lane keeping assistance or lane centering this ev is targeted at a slightly different customer \\nthan some of the evs that you\\'ll find in america right now and you\\'ll really notice that we take a loo k at \\nthe wheels and tires the alloy wheels feature an asymmetrical design and rather surprisingly these are \\nwrapped in some really high performance tires these are goodyear eagle f1 tires so no ultra hard low \\nrolling resistance tires here but they are 205 width so they\\'re relatively narrow but that\\'s enabled by a \\nlight curb weight focusing a bit more on driving dynamics and a little bit less on range and efficiency \\nmakes an awful lot of sense for this model because this is targeted at someone that wants a d aily \\ncommuter vehicle or a weekend fun vehicle that\\'s very style forward but doesn\\'t need an enormous \\nback seat or a big cargo area mini also says that their average shopper owns multiple vehicles already so \\nthis is an additional vehicle for them it\\'s not their only car to choose from so this is targeted at someone \\nthat wants more of a daily commuter style vehicle and is a bit of a pragmatist when it comes to evs \\nsomeone that doesn\\'t really think they need the longer range because they have something else t o \\ndrive if they want to drive 300 or 400 miles at a time although it\\'s a little bit difficult to tell if you park \\nthis next to a standard non -electric mini cooper you\\'ll notice that this rides a little bit higher it\\'s nearly \\nan inch higher off the ground t hat\\'s because the battery pack sits under the vehicle it\\'s not in the trunk \\nor anything like that bmw says that even though this model is a little bit higher off the ground than the \\nrest of the mini lineup the center of gravity is nearly two inches closer to the ground and not only that \\nbut because of the way the battery pack is positioned which we\\'ll talk about in a little bit more weight is \\non the rear than in the front and that means this has a better weight balance than the rest of the mini \\nlineup out b ack this again looks like the rest of the mini lineup except for this little yellow icon right \\nthere and of course the yellow s over there on the cooper logo we have led tail lamp modules that \\nfeature the british flag the union jack right there and then we  have backup lights down there at the \\nbottom in case you\\'re wondering the turn signals are red they\\'re not amber mini is known for building \\nlightweight small fun to drive front wheel drive vehicles but electrification allows for a reordering of \\npriorities and so i\\'m a little bit surprised that this didn\\'t end up being rear -wheel drive and the reason \\nfor that is that we find the same electric motor that powers the rear wheel drive bmw i3 under here if \\nyou didn\\'t know it bmw builds an awful lot of vehicles wi th plugs outside of companies like nissan tesla \\nand general motors bmw is shifting the most vehicles in north america with plugs more than the \\ncombined entity of hyundai and kia actually more than hyundai kia honda and toyota put together so \\nwhen it came t ime to design this mini they simply reached into the parts bin grabbed the electric motor \\nfrom the back of the i3 and plopped it right here under the hood again i\\'m a little bit sad that this didn\\'t \\nend up being rear -wheel drive but it would have been a li ttle bit out of character for the mini brand this \\nmotor produces 181 horsepower and 199 pound -feet of torque making this one of the most powerful \\nminis you can buy in the us and because of the way electric motors deliver torque this is going to be \\nfaster 0  to 60 than some of the turbocharged options in the mini lineup that theoretically produce more \\npower going in for a closer look you might be wondering what all these metal bars are for remember \\nthat in most vehicles with engines up front the engine is par t of the crash structure or at least it\\'s been \\naccounted for in the way the crash structures in the vehicle operate so replacing it with an electric \\nmotor means that that crash structure may perform differently so they put these bars here to make \\nsure it\\'s  consistent with the crash test scores we see in the rest of the mini lineup an important feature \\nin here that\\'s not immediately visible is that the electric mini has a heat pump not a resistive element \\nheater for heating the cabin that means that heating this cabin in cold weather is going to be much \\nmore efficient than a lot of is out there including every modern tesla except for the model y heat pumps \\nare available in a number of other electric vehicles out there but they\\'re not necessarily standard in a  lot \\nof those options and for 29 900 you are going to get the heat pump standard in this mini that means \\n\\nthat if it\\'s 45 degrees outside or 30 or 20 degrees outside this vehicle is going to consume an awful lot \\nless battery to keep the cabin warm speaking of the battery it\\'s a 32.6 kilowatt hour lithium ion battery \\npack 28.9 kilowatt hours are usable it\\'s arr anged somewhat similarly to what we found in the chevy volt \\nit\\'s a t -shaped battery pack not a true skateboard battery pack so it goes from between the driver and \\nfront passenger seats approximately to below the rear seats the positioning of the battery pa ck means \\nthat we get exactly the same cargo area in the back and basically the same seating area inside that we \\nfind in the regular mini according to the epa tests this battery is good for 110 miles and 108 mpge but \\nwe have definitely been beating the 108 mpge score charging happens via this charge door right here on \\nthe passenger side of the vehicle we have a standard j1772 charging connector and a standard ccs fast \\ncharge connector having a smaller battery pack on board means that it takes less time to co mpletely \\ncharge the battery and of course it helps improve overall vehicle efficiency which is certainly good in the \\nmini cooper se even with these aggressive tires that we have on this model again these are eagle f1 tires \\nif you have access to a level 2 e vse that is capable of it this vehicle will charge at 7.4 kilowatts taking you \\nfrom zero to completely full in four hours or a little bit less also an unusual twist mini is giving us two \\nevses with this vehicle we have a turbocharged cord that will charge at 3.8 kilowatts 240 volts that will \\ntake this from zero to completely full in a little bit under eight hours and then we have a standard 1.2 \\nkilowatt 120 volt cord that will take this from zero to full in about 24 hours or so pretty similar to the kia \\nsoul ev that i used to own for a lot of folks out there that are looking at this as a commuter vehicle if \\nyou\\'re commuting 30 40 miles a day you\\'ll have absolutely no problem charging this overnight with just \\nthe included 1.2 kilowatt cord at least for the mo ment the electric drivetrain is available only in the two -\\ndoor four -seat mini cooper so no electric clubman or countrymen at the moment we have manual seats \\nfor the driver and front passenger in all versions of this we have a lever to adjust the seat heigh t one to \\nadjust the seat recline and then we have a knob on the other side for the lumbar support the logical \\nreason for the manual seat designs is definitely weight savings but i wish these seats were just a little bit \\nmore adjustable i wish we could adju st the tilt of the seat bottom cushioned like we see in some bmw \\nmodels with manual seats but we can\\'t do that but on the bright side we do get a manual extending \\nthigh cushion right here and the passenger seat has exactly the same range of motion as the d river\\'s \\nseat including the thigh extension and the lumbar support as with pretty much any two -door vehicle the \\nmini is more about the front seat than it is about the back seat but you could still get back here in a \\npinch again this is a four seat vehicle o nly so no center seat belt back here just like the regular mini \\ncooper the only real difference i noticed back here between this and the gasoline mini cooper is that the \\nseat bottom cushions do appear to be ever so slightly thinner that could be an optical  illusion and then \\nunder that we have a slightly different shape to the way the carpet is molded under there headroom is \\nnot exactly huge back here but you could definitely stick four adults in the mini if you needed to if i slide \\nthis front seat back into  the same position that it was before you can see that my knees are definitely \\ndigging into the seat back but again if i really needed to i could make that front passenger sit a little bit \\nmore upright and a little bit further forward you\\'d be able to put a six six -foot person up front and a six -\\nfoot person behind with relative comfort now if i try and put my head back to these headrests i don\\'t \\nthink it\\'s actually possible to touch the headrest nope not quite my head is instead hitting the ceiling \\nthere bu t if i\\'m sitting in more of an average seating position than my hair is just brushing the ceiling we \\ndo have the panoramic moonroof on this model and that means that i have a separate shade right back \\nhere for the rear passengers again the rear seats fold in a 60 40 fashion which i do find a little bit odd \\nbecause if you fold this 60 side then it really is cutting into this 40 side over here on the right side of the \\ncar because of the battery\\'s position cargo space is completely unaffected by the electric c onversion so \\nbehind this hatch we still find 8.7 cubic feet of storage space if you fold the rear seats flat you have \\naccess to about 34 cubic feet of storage space and the load floor can be raised up so that way it is level \\nwith the rear seat backs in add ition to that lower load floor setting you can also open it and have access \\nto the cargo area below or completely remove this from the vehicle so that way you have the most \\n\\ncargo space possible below that load floor we certainly have enough room to store your charging cables \\nand then one thing that i\\'ve always found odd is that we do have a 60 40 folding rear seat back what\\'s \\nweird about that is that the mini cooper does not seat five it only seats four so that\\'s a two person rear \\nbench as we look around the interior you should know that although this starts at about twenty nine \\nthousand nine hundred dollars the model that we\\'re looking at is about thirty seven thousand dollar s \\nbefore tax title and destination so obviously there are features that you won\\'t find on the base model \\nlike this two pane panoramic moon roof now one thing i have to comment on is that this moon roof \\nshade does not block an awful lot of light and it does  make the cabin a little bit hotter in really strong \\nsunlight moving down from there we have fixed height shoulder belts and two -way adjustable headrests \\nfor the driver and front passenger the model that we\\'re driving has this very attractive leather \\nuphol stery with some extra stitching going on there in the main part of the seat back and seat bottom \\ncushion we have fairly aggressive bolstering for a small car and on the seat bottom cushion you can see \\nthat extending thigh cushion just a little bit more clo sely it\\'s a very similar design to what we see in a lot \\nof bmws the front doors feature a mixture of hard and soft touch plastics there is a soft touch upper \\nsection a soft touch armrest there sort of a rubbery middle and then harder plastics down there at  the \\nbottom of the door just as you\\'d expect around bottle holders in areas that need a bit more durability \\nwe have speaker grilles right there in the door and up here on the a -pillar because we do have the \\noptional harman kardon audio system the styling i nside is basically the same as the rest of the mini \\nlineup except for this sort of yellowy stripe that we find there on the trim panel just on the passenger \\nside the upper section of the dashboard is made from a soft touch injection molded plastic as is th is mid \\nportion of the dashboard and then we find hard plastic slower for instance around this glove \\ncompartment this is a slot style glove compartment and i was not able to fit a full -size ipad inside minis \\nhave long been known for their somewhat eccentric  styling especially this very round styling element \\nhere in the middle of the dashboard this is no longer where we find the speedometer of course this is \\nnow where we find the infotainment system there\\'s a standard infotainment system that\\'s just over six \\ninches that features a touch screen and apple carplay integration standard we\\'re driving the fully loaded \\nmodel so we have this 8.8 inch infotainment system with factory navigation now one thing that i found \\ninteresting is that we don\\'t have quite as many different driving displays for the ev system as i thought \\nthere would be so there\\'s a minimalism analyzer that helps you score your driving and your anticipation \\nbreaking scores etc there\\'s one here that\\'ll tell you whether you turn on or off the heated se ats how \\nmuch range that would give you there\\'s an option to plan your charging and pre -condition the cabin just \\nas you\\'d expect in an electric vehicle there are obviously vehicle settings in here as well and then we get \\na very quick onboard info screen whi ch shows us our average consumption miles per kilowatt hour this \\nis not our weekly total of course because this is after we\\'ve been zero to 60 testing range testing \\nclimbing hills having an awful lot of fun with it etc and then there\\'s a slight variant on that as well below \\nthe infotainment cluster we find the controls for the dual zone automatic climate control this is also \\nwhere we find the buttons for the heated seats no ventilated seats in here button for the parking sensor \\nthis toggle right here contro ls the regen braking you can choose between high and low regen braking \\nbut one thing that i found odd or perhaps a little annoying is that the vehicle always defaults to its one \\npedal operation and the maximum regeneration i wish that there was some other mode or some way to \\nchange the way that defaulted we have the start stop toggle right there and that same sort of yellowy \\ngreen a button for the traction stability control system and then a drive mode toggle right over there \\nbelow that we have a 12 volt po wer port usb input right there this does support wireless apple carplay \\nso you don\\'t need to have your iphone connected to that usb input for that to work two large cup \\nholders right there a slightly different shifter than we find in the rest of the lineup  this is a little bit more \\nlike bmw\\'s shifters this is a joystick style so we pull back for drive press that button right there for park \\nwe then have the controller for that infotainment system there\\'s some direct access buttons up top \\nsome buttons down th ere and then this moves side to side and pushes down to select we then have an \\n\\nelectric parking brake between the front seats there\\'s an itty bitty little center console if you open that \\nup this is where we find the wireless charging mat for your cell phone and this compartment is also \\nventilated so that way your iphone does not over heat if we move that out of the way we find a little \\nstorage area right there between the front seats as well you can put some larger items there because \\nthere\\'s probably about four or five inches between there and the bottom of the armrest our model has \\nthe optional heads -up display but rather than this being projected on the windshield it\\'s projected on \\nthis small sheet of tinted plastic that raises and lowers from the dashboard the instrument cluster \\nsurprised me at first but then i remembered that this starts under thirty thousand dollars so that\\'s why \\nwe find such a small lcd the lcd\\'s upper corner is right about here and the lower corner is right about \\nthere this is a fairly small portrait style lcd instrument cluster the information displayed by the l cd is \\npretty basic we get our range and temperature right up there speed limit actual speed the position of \\nthe transmission right there whether we\\'re in drive or park the drive mode whether we\\'re in green or \\nwhether in the mid or right up there the red fo r sport and then in the lower right hand corner we can \\ntoggle through a few different readouts with a button on the turn signal stock to the right of the lcd we \\nfind an led display for the battery state of charge you can see we have these individual little  led \\nelements then we have something very similar over here on the right side for the power and charge \\ngauge if we toggle through the two different regenerative braking mode you can see that that one little \\nelement turns on and off we then have an actual p hysical needle right here for the power gauge and \\nthen an led display for the zero to 100 portion if you zoom in really closely you can just barely see the \\noutlines of the needle and little center portion that rotates moving out from there we find one of m y \\nfavorite steering wheels it\\'s a round three spoke design with some pretty aggressive sport grips up top i \\nlove the way the stitching is done here the bottom spoke is split and you can see if i put my hand behind \\nthere that we have that little union jack logo on the left side of the steering column we find the controls \\nfor the cruise control system for some reason adaptive cruiser tool is not available in this mini on this \\nside we find the controls for the infotainment system including track forward backwa rd volume up \\ndown voice command button and a phone button in our 0 -60 tests this was surprisingly faster than the \\nestimate 6.2 seconds 0 -60 not nearly 7 seconds as they are indicating that makes us one of the fastest \\nmini cooper models if you want to go fa ster than this in your two -door cooper you\\'re gonna have to get \\nsomething like the jcw version that will theoretically go zero to 60 about two to three tenths of a second \\nfaster than this but it\\'s not going to feel quite like this it\\'s not going to have th e direct responsiveness \\nthat we find out of this electric drivetrain now rather unfortunately it\\'s pretty obvious that bmw is \\nlimiting torque at lower rpms because they would simply overwhelm the wheels and you can see that \\nbecause if we disable the tracti on control here and we simply stop this much torque delivered this \\ninstantly should give us some wheel spin and it doesn\\'t we get pretty drama free acceleration we see \\nbasically the same thing going on in kia\\'s nero the hyundai kona electric does allow you  to have a little \\nbit more fun as does the chevy bolt but generally speaking most of the mainstream electric vehicles \\naren\\'t quite as crazy as tesla\\'s tuning tesla allows you an awful lot more torque right from the start but \\nof course the target market for  the mini electric is a little bit different because this is considerably less \\nexpensive and it still qualifies for the federal tax credit which obviously we\\'ll talk about here in a bit but \\nthat means that most folks out there that are interested in shoppi ng for a mini electric are effectively \\ngoing to be paying probably around twenty thousand dollars for a base model that will of course \\ndepend on how much of that tax credit applies to you and how much of the state and local incentives \\nthat are available al so apply to you but if you\\'re in a state like colorado this could be quite inexpensive \\nas i said before mini\\'s mission is a little bit different than some of the other electric vehicles out there \\nthey\\'re not targeting extra long range but they\\'re interesti ngly targeting good handling and good driving \\ndynamics and that\\'s why we find those eagle f1 tires on all four corners that helps out our stopping \\ndistance this is the heaviest version of the mini cooper this is over 3 100 pounds this is about 400 \\npounds h eavier than the absolute base version of the mini and you will feel that out on the road it\\'s also \\n\\na little bit noticeable in the stopping distances but at 125 feet from 60 miles an hour to zero that\\'s \\ncertainly shorter than i was expecting and shorter than something like an ionic electric or a \\nneuroelectric and remember this model has two of five with tires but we still have excellent handling \\nand that\\'s possible thanks to the low center of gravity and just the overall suspension design that we \\nfind in the mini cooper this has a very engaging feel to it out on the road it\\'s definitely a lot of fun when \\nit comes to handling i\\'m certainly going to give this model an a now that\\'s not quite as engaging as \\nsomething like a jcw version of the cooper but i think this is more fun than the mid -level 2 -liter turbo \\ntrim a lot of that has to do with the accessibilit y of the power and how the power and torque rolls on \\nelectric vehicles just have that instant power delivery you don\\'t have to wait for a transmission to shift \\non the other hand i\\'m not the biggest fan of one pedal driving in any ev for some reason i under stand \\nthat some folks really really love it and if you love it it is available here we can go to a complete stop i\\'m \\nnot touching the brake pedal at all take us to that full stop and it will hold it there it will blend the regen \\nbraking and the friction br aking in order to do that and take you and keep you at that stop if we go to \\nthe low regen setting it\\'s still about the same aggressiveness as we find a lot of evs out there feels a \\nlittle bit more aggressive than your average internal combustion vehicle a nd there is no coast setting \\nlike there is in some evs i think that\\'s a little bit of a pity i would have loved to seen some regen paddles \\nor a regen shifter here in the center console or just a mode that allowed no regen at all most studies out \\nthere have  indicated that zero regen with a combined blended braking system is likely the most efficient \\ndriving mode because in situations where it is truly more efficient to coast you can have that true \\ncoasting mode rather than trying to feather the accelerator p edal to find essentially coasting the \\ncounterpoint to the excellent handling ability is the ride quality out on a rougher road surface like we\\'re \\non here and that\\'s why i\\'m going to give this model a scene minus when it comes to ride quality this \\nsuspensio n is tuned very very firmly even though we have relatively skinny tires they\\'re not exactly high \\nhigh -profile tires and that means that we can feel a lot of these bumps on the road whether they\\'re \\nsmaller imperfections or larger imperfections a lot of that  is coming into the cabin now that doesn\\'t \\nmean the suspension of the mini cooper gets upset it doesn\\'t this is very well planted even on imperfect \\npavement in the corners it just means that you are going to feel every one of those bumps as you\\'re out \\non the road but i suppose that goes with the character of the mini cooper because they\\'ve always \\nclaimed that this has go -kart like handling and in some ways go -kart like ride quality as well when the \\nroad starts really winding you\\'ll notice that the mini elec tric hasn\\'t really lost anything versus the rest of \\nthe mini lineup the ride quality is a little bit different things feel a little bit softer because of the added \\nweight the weight is really noticeable back there but we have a better weight balance than w e find in \\nthe rest of the mini lineup and we have levels of grip that really are very very similar this is a ton of fun \\nout on your favorite winding mountain road the tires the chassis everything just comes together and \\nthis is exactly what minis are all a bout when many owners talk about fun to drive they\\'re not talking \\nabout 0 to 60 numbers definitely things that are faster 0 -60 than anything in the mini lineup but it\\'s \\nabout the feel it\\'s about the zippiness it\\'s about the road holding ability it\\'s about that go -kart like \\nstableness we don\\'t get any body roll there\\'s no tip and dive going on in here this is a ton of fun and \\nwhen the car does lose a little bit of grip like you found in that corner it\\'s very very predictable and a \\nlittle bit more predictable  than other minis because of the better weight balance now the weight \\nbalance in here is still not 50 50. we\\'re told it\\'s about 56 to 58 or so up front but it\\'s an awful lot closer \\nthan the regular minis in our cabin noise test we got 73 decibels in here t hat makes us a little bit louder \\nthan some of the other small evs on the market some of that may have to do with the tire choice and of \\ncourse the suspension design here these are more performance oriented tires than we find in many evs \\nout there and they may be giving us a little bit more road noise wind noise is pretty well controlled but \\nout on the highway at higher speeds you will notice a little bit of that intruding in the cabin in our ev \\nrange test this model performed very well we averaged 3.8 miles  per kilowatt hour giving this an aoa \\nreal world range of 106 miles that\\'s pretty close to the epa score and definitely usable for most folks out \\n\\nthere the range in this ev reminds me an awful lot of the range in my soul ev that i had for three years \\nthat range was about 100 miles in real world driving it would be somewhere in the 80 to 90 mile range \\ndepending on exactly how hot it was outside it di d have a heat pump as well and that really helped that \\nout in cold weather and that\\'s something that we see in this mini electric as well this has a heat pump \\nsystem so range is going to be more predictable summer and winter rather than some of those other  \\nevs out there especially discount evs that don\\'t have a standard heat pump system so if you\\'re \\ncomparing this to for instance the base version of the nissan leaf or some of those other shorter range \\nevs out there keep in mind they don\\'t all have heat pump s in their base models some of them may have \\noptional heat pump systems but you\\'re not going to get it for 30 000 now my daily commute is a little \\nbit different than my ev test route and on that driving route we averaged about 3.4 miles per kilowatt \\nhour s o a little bit lower than the 3.8 that we get in our range test when it comes to economy i\\'m \\ncertainly going to give the electric minion a 3.8 miles per kilowatt hour is decent as is 3.4 miles per \\nkilowatt hour in my daily driving cycle this is definitely in keeping with other shorter range evs out there \\nso if you\\'re looking for something that\\'s efficient that\\'s economical that\\'s very practical and definitely \\nfun if your commute involves some winding roads this is exactly the kind of eevee that you should g et \\nthis may not be as practical as something like an ionic eevee or a leaf or a nero or a kona but this is an \\nawful lot more fun for 2020 the cooper se is the least expensive electric vehicle on sale in the united \\nstates it starts at nine 29 dollars but th ere is a pretty long waiting list at this moment i checked and it \\nseems to be about four to six months so if you want one you need to go over to the mini site and try \\nand reserve yours today the cooper se still qualifies for the full federal tax credit of 7 500 plus state and \\nlocal incentives now obviously you should make sure with your tax professional that that applies to you \\nif you\\'re depending on those credits in order to be able to afford the car but if you do qualify for all of \\nthe incentives it could  drive the price of your cooper sc down to just twenty thousand four hundred \\ndollars and if you\\'re living in colorado and you can get your hands on one this calendar year it could be \\neven lower the model we were driving this week came in at 37 750 because it did have a very expensive \\n7 000 option package on it but even the base cooper se comes pretty well equipped we get a 6.5 inch \\nnavigation screen apple carplay standard led headlamps heated front seats and heated side mirrors as \\nwell automatic climate con trol and the digital instrument cluster are also standard but we don\\'t see \\nquite the same number of customization options available on the cooper sc that we find in the gasoline \\ncooper although obviously there\\'s a lot you could do after market before we di ve into specific \\ncompetitors let\\'s talk about the competitive landscape the cooper sc is significantly less expensive than \\na wide variety of other evs out there and at this moment it also has one of the shortest ranges so it is \\nimportant to keep in mind ra nge of just about 110 miles when driven gently that puts the cooper se in a \\nvery interesting category it is significantly less expensive for instance than a tesla model 3. the model 3 \\nstarts at 37 900 and it does not qualify for any federal tax credits any more and that means that any way \\nyou slice it the model 3 is going to be 15 000 more expensive than a cooper sc and depending on the \\nexact local state incentives that you may qualify for it essentially could be double the price of the mini \\nso while the mod el 3 i think is unquestionably the better ev it\\'s also significantly more expensive and \\nfrankly just not competition neither is the nero the chevy bolt or something like the fiat 500e 500 \\ntheoretically could have been but it\\'s actually been discontinued fo r 2020. we may or may not get the \\nnew 500e for 2021 we don\\'t have any details from fiat at the time we\\'re recording this video that leaves \\njust two electric vehicles in similar price ranges to the mini cooper the nissan leaf at 31 600 starting and \\nthe hyun dai ioniq at 33 045 both of those are more expensive than the base cooper se but we do get a \\nlittle bit more range in those models let\\'s talk about the nissan leaf first first thing you\\'ll notice is it has a \\nlonger range nearly 150 miles versus 110 miles i n the mini cooper but dc fast charging is optional and \\nthe on -board charger is not as fast as we find in the mini cooper so regardless of how you\\'re going to \\nplug it in the mini cooper is probably going to get you extra range faster also keep in mind that the \\nnissan leaf has an air -cooled battery pack so there are some concerns about longevity and it\\'s likely that \\n\\nthe battery pack in the mini cooper could last a little bit longer bmw mini\\'s parent company has had a \\nlong history of plug -in hybrid and ev models so they really have the battery thing nailed down the mini \\ncooper i think is better styled it\\'s also more fu n it\\'s also a little bit more unique really than the nissan \\nleaf the nissan leaf comes across as very pragmatic very practical it\\'s a four -door hatchback we have \\nmore cargo room we have more passenger room it\\'s going to be a little bit more comfortable esp ecially \\nif you\\'re a larger person on the inside because the vehicle is wider it also has wider seats a little bit more \\nheadroom here and there than we find in the mini cooper as well but it\\'s not going to be as fun it\\'s not \\ngoing to be as unique as the min i either next up we have the hyundai ioniq the ioniq has a little bit \\nlonger range than the leaf at 170 miles but it\\'s a little bit slower zero to 60 than the leaf the leaf is \\nalmost as fast as the mini cooper at about seven and a half seconds zero to sixt y or so the ionic is \\naround the eight second mark but what you give up an acceleration you gain back in range 170 miles \\nand we get a lot of standard equipment the mini cooper has a standard dc fast charger which is an \\nadvantage over the nissan leaf but so does the hyundai ionic and it\\'s the same fast charger connection \\nreally it\\'s the sae combo connector which is becoming more popular and  \\n \\n \\nCar Model : 2021 Mini Cooper SE  \\nReview:  hi guys and today i\\'ve got for you the 2021 mini cooper s however this mini doesn\\'t have a \\nconventional petrol engine underneath this bonnet because this mini is green well yes of course it\\'s \\nresplendent in british racing green but what i mean by that is t hat this is the mini electric how can you \\ntell well it\\'s got the blanked out grille it\\'s got no exhaust pipe it\\'s got e badges and on the fuel filler cover \\nit has an e and that\\'s actually now where you plug in the cables this is in fact the third g eneration of the \\nnew new mini came out in 2014. i have reviewed it previously there\\'s been a couple of updates most \\nrecently for this 2021 model year now i suspect an all -new fourth generation mini can\\'t be far away and \\ni wonder if a bit like what fiat has  done with the 500 that\\'s going to be in all electric range now so what\\'s \\nthis then a practice electric mini well no not really because they already did that in the late 2000s they \\ncame out with the mini electric then but they produced it in limited number s just a few hundred that \\none had no rear seat and limited luggage space this mini is said to be near identical to the regular mini \\nin terms of interior space how have they done that well the 32.6 kilowatt per hour battery now sits in a \\nt-shape underneath the rear seats and along the middle of the car but they have had to lift it by 18 \\nmillimeters to allow more battery clearance down there however the center of gravity is actually 30 \\nmillimeters lower because the batteries are heavier they add weight to the  car how much weight they \\nhad 145 kilograms of the weight taking this up to nearly 1400 kilograms it\\'s not slow though the motor \\nat the front puts out 181 brake horsepower about the same as the petrol mini cooper s however it\\'s got \\n199 pounds for the torqu e that goes to a single speed transmission to the front wheels virtually \\ninstantaneously that gives it zero to 62 miles per hour acceleration time of just 7.3 seconds and a top \\nspeed of 93 miles per hour now many claim that when you charge up to 100 you ge t a mileage range of \\nup to 145 miles but when i got it up to 100 i saw an indicated 114 miles now the mini electric is available \\nin three trim levels they\\'re all badge cooper s but you\\'ve got level one level two and level three level \\none is just over twent y six thousand pounds this level two starts from just under thirty thousand pounds \\nbut with options on this test car it goes to well over 31 000 pounds i\\'ll go over the options once we get \\ninside the car now i know a lot of you will be familiar with the mi ni uh in this generation because it\\'s \\nbeen around a few years but we\\'re going to take a quick look at the practicality we\\'re going to look at \\nthe front cabin because there\\'s been some changes there and then of course we\\'re going to take it for \\nthe all impo rtant drive before we do that make sure you\\'re subscribing to youtube.com forward slash \\nbrown car guy browncarguy.com and follow me on all the socials by searching for brown car guy if you \\n\\nenjoy my videos you can support them over at patreon.com forward slash brown car guy cool let\\'s get \\ninto this [Music] so let\\'s check out the back of the mini before we do that check out the tail lights \\nthey\\'ve got the half union jack introduced on this gen eration i kind of like that and of course like i said \\nthe yellow badges that denote the fact that this is the mini electric now the boot you can then open \\neither from a button under here or with the key fob which is in my pocket check out the cute mini \\nkeyring that goes with that and all i do is press that bit that opens up not powered though once it goes \\nup you\\'ve got about 211 litres of boot space in here which is about what you\\'d expect from a mini there \\nis a little bit more space underneath this floor w hich of course can also be removed but the space in this \\ncar is basically taken up by charging cables tire repair kit and a first aid kit you get a home charging cable \\nand you get a machine charging cable if you plugged in a home it would take hours to cha rge if you \\nplugged it into a machine which i did do typically you get about 80 in 30 minutes so reasonable about \\nwhat you\\'d expect for a mini now i\\'m not even going to attempt to get into those rear seats but regular \\nsize adults could probably just about m anage if they\\'re front and rear children should be okay they do \\nhave a child seat isofix anchor points on this car so they can be used for that or you can drop them \\ndown to give yourself more luggage space so that\\'s quite useful in that sense time now to g et into the \\nfront of the car and see what changes they\\'ve been in there should close it [Applause] here we are in \\nthe mini it\\'s nice and comfortable it\\'s good to be back in a mini a mini always feels kind of you know fits \\nlike a glove but you know it\\'s a b it small but there\\'s always enough room in the front especially for my \\nlong legs not an issue of course the steering is uh rake and adjustable so that\\'s no problem and the \\ninstrument panel which is now new so let me turn this on the starter button is down here it\\'s bright \\nyellow that denotes the the fact that it\\'s a mini electric and also you\\'ve got a bit of yellow on the gear \\nlever as well again that shows you that this is the mini electric plus a couple other buttons so if i press \\nthat down all stereo com es on and this gets a new instrument panel now with a matte finish so although \\nit\\'s got no hood and no cover and you might think that that would be affected by reflections and stuff it \\nisn\\'t because the mat kind of kills all the reflections and it\\'s never a problem so pretty straightforward \\ni\\'m not going to go into too much detail the steering wheel does have remotes on it for the stereo on \\nhere for this cruise active cruise control on this car on here and on here you get a display on the left side \\nwhich is  basically shows you uh how you\\'re using the power so when it dips down it\\'s charging when it\\'s \\nup it\\'s using the power 50 hundred percent here you\\'ve got the actual percentage remaining in the \\nbattery 100 50 percent down at the bottom is telling you 44 so  it\\'s telling you how much percentage of \\nthe battery is left and at the top is telling you the mileage range that you have uh available let\\'s give \\ntemperature time and that\\'s the speedometer on there uh this big center dial here is of course um a \\ntradition  now in minis and it stays in this car they\\'ve improved the the touch screen on this car now so \\nyou\\'ve got all of these systems on here you can also do that you can scroll through you can configure \\nhow you want this setup and it gives you down here the inf ormation on on the mini itself but actually if i \\njust do that it\\'s telling me 4.9 miles per kilowatt is what i\\'ve achieved on this car so far uh one thing i \\ndon\\'t know about this i mean this has this light that goes up here that does various things dependi ng on \\nthe music and the speed and stuff like that but the screen itself just takes up that part and you do \\nwonder why don\\'t they just fill the entire space with a digital screen but at the moment that\\'s what \\nthey\\'re doing maybe that\\'s something they\\'re goi ng to do next time that\\'s your sound your all all around \\nactive safety button is there the see it\\'s come on in this car i should actually turn that off because that\\'s \\njust using up juice i can do that by just spinning that round to the left that\\'s your cli mate control that\\'s \\nclimate control buttons max ac heated seats on this car now this is toggle switches on here so the \\nwindow switches have now been moved to the door same round patterns everywhere that you see \\ntypical of a mini you\\'ve got the starter butt on next to start about in traction on off and less important \\nthis button here is is the driver mode button so you have two green modes and you see them they come \\nup here and it shows you on here and it shows you can configure the green but basically the gr een shuts \\ndown the ac reduces the comfort features reduces the the power available to basically focus on giving \\n\\nyou the maximum range and you can actually see that the range maybe goes up by a mile or so when i \\nchange through the modes here it will start on the mid is its uh default setting but there\\'s also sport and \\nthe sport will give you enhanced performance from  the throttle but also a stiffer steering wheel we\\'ll \\ntalk about that stiffer steering i should say we\\'ll talk about that on the go there\\'s also two regen modes \\nso over here with this button you can select the regen so now i can actually turn the regens of f actually \\nno i\\'ve got either mild regen or full regen it starts on full region by default now the full region basically \\nwe\\'ll talk about this on the go but that gives you a one pedal driving um which you kind of get used to \\nyou you will get used to actual ly i\\'ll talk about that on the go but also what that does is it recoups \\nbattery power on the go every time you\\'re braking you know you you recover some mileage we\\'ll talk \\nabout that again as we drive the car down here there\\'s a power supply in here there\\'s  a usb port two \\ncupholders this is your single speed transmission no paddle shift doesn\\'t need any so that\\'s what you \\nhave there you have all your controls here this is familiar to people who have minis and recent minis \\nand bmws it\\'s got the same sort of m enu system uh e handbrake little tray down here this tiny little \\ncompartment in the cubby box down here and of course this is an adjustable armrest which is quite \\nhandy um just quickly tell you about the options on this car like i said the level two this o ne it\\'s got i \\nmean uh they all have digital instruments and cruise control level two adds a speed limit to traffic sign \\nrecognition collision mitigation automatic high beam rear cameras heated seats and the part leather \\nupholstery which you can see on thes e seats level um of course also get some mini connected services \\nnavigation the remotes on the steering as i mentioned automatic wipers automatic led headlights and \\nnice fixed chelsea anchor points as i mentioned level three will add a heads up display wir eless phone \\ncharging park assist that will park itself and the panoramic sunroof as well as harman kardon speak \\ncarton speakers on this one i don\\'t think it has those but the stereo is pretty good i mean listen to it no \\nissues so actually you\\'re fine with the regular stereo the level three by the way i think i forgot to \\nmention starts from 32 000 pounds um i will say that the car play and android or just got android auto \\ncarplay the car play initially was quite fussy to set up just by plugging in it didn\\'t have to go into the \\nmenu and configure and stuff like that but once you\\'ve done that once it will automatically recognize \\nthe phone and it comes on every time you need it so that\\'s pretty much straightforward so there you go \\nthat\\'s what it\\'s like that\\'s th e interior the changes to the 2021 model year what\\'s it like on the go let\\'s \\nfind that out next okay guys let\\'s take this mini for a little bit of a run now i\\'m going to put it straight into \\nthe sports mode yeah i\\'m going to push straight into sports mode because i\\'m on some nice little bits of \\nroads here so this should be interesting um so there\\'s zero look at this there\\'s a off the line you know \\nand it actually twitches at the front you know so that the wheels front wheels are scrabbling and trying \\nto fin d grip off the line um the crucial thing i think that nowadays you know we always measure the \\nacceleration times zero to 60 miles per hour zero to 100 kilometers per hour i think that\\'s very quickly \\ngoing to change to zero to uh 30 miles per hour uh zero z ero yes say zero to thirty miles per hour and \\nzero to 50 kilometers per hour uh because for example on this car that time is 3.9 seconds and oh my \\ngod yeah you can feel it of course when you start to do this sort of stuff you will start to deplete the uh \\nthe range and the battery power but i gotta say it\\'s worth it um the question so once we\\'re doing this \\npair i\\'ll get into the modes and stuff later on whilst we\\'re doing this bit the question is does it feel like a \\nmini still well you know they said that th ey tuned the suspension deliberately to make it feel like a mini \\ncooper obviously they had to deal with the different ride height and the weight and stuff like that but \\nthe weight distribution actually improved because it had to change the more weight at t he front so \\nactually before it was 60 40 front bias now it\\'s 56 45 44 front and rear by so it\\'s actually improved a little \\nbit gives you a little bit more of an even balance um which means that you know it\\'s still as dirty oh man \\nit really gets some torque s there when you try to put the power down through a mid bend um so it\\'s it\\'s \\nquite you know it\\'s still as nippy and as agile somehow uh the the steering is not as alive as i think i \\nremember it and particularly you know it kind of feels a little bit light  like now it\\'s in the sports mode \\nand actually firms up and gets meatier in there but around the middle bit it\\'s still a little bit light and i \\n\\ndon\\'t know no you\\'re not getting any feel or anything like that so that\\'s always a little bit of an issue uh \\nwith these modern systems so i think that\\'s where the compromise has had to be made is that you\\'ve \\nlost something there uh just in the sense that h ow you interact with the with the main interface of the \\ncar which is of course the steering wheel feels nice and chunky and all the rest of it but oh my god the \\nacceleration of the line is extraordinary um there are quicker cars of course um but i think th at off the \\nline i imagine a few cars would keep up with this and then once you got up to about 30 um miles per \\nhour you\\'d probably be overtaken by other cars i think that\\'s what would happen but having said that \\nminis are all about low speed fun aren\\'t the y they\\'re all about you know thrashing around town and \\nhaving a laugh you know with that sort of stuff and being able to charge our junctions like i did there \\nwithout having to worry about what might be coming because you\\'ve already gone you know you\\'ve le ft \\nthe junction so to speak so the driving mode so now put it back into mid mode which is the sort of \\ndefault mode but you know the acceleration is still there to be honest in the modes even below this to \\nbe honest the difference between i think the mid an d the sports is really just the steering firming up \\nsteering is even lighter now but honestly like if you\\'re just doing around town stuff it won\\'t make any \\ndifference and then you\\'ve got two modes below that you\\'ve got green and green plus which actually \\nconfigurable somehow and basically what they\\'re about is turning everything else down and focusing on \\nconserving battery power so for example the acu like i\\'ve got on at the moment would be reduced if i \\nturn it down into i go mid uh green and then green plu s and yeah i can feel that there is some air \\nblowing through but it\\'s nowhere near as cool as what it was just a second ago so let\\'s put that back into \\nmid the difference is subtle you recoup a little bit of miles on there but having said that if you reall y \\nwant to recoup miles you just leave it in full regen which is how i\\'ve been driving it you\\'ve got two \\nmodes of regen it default starts in the in the full regen mode you can then drop it one level down to the \\nregular regen mode the full regen mode does al low one pedal driving now the one pedal driving i quite \\nlike i get used to it quite quickly i know some people find that a little bit awkward and hard to get used \\nto but i don\\'t have an issue with it um and the brake pedal still works like i\\'m in one pedal  mode now \\nthe brake still feels the same way reacts the same way it stops the same way the good thing about this \\none pedal system is yes it will come almost to hold sometimes to hold sometimes almost to hold \\nsometimes it still creeps forward you say oh is that a mistake is that a problem is that an issue no i don\\'t \\nthink so because what they\\'ve done i think that compared to some other one pedal systems that i\\'ve \\ntried is that you know the relentlessness of the the acceleration is ridiculous because there ar e any good \\nchanges either there you go just rather got a slight understeer scrabble around the grip turns around \\ntypical mini thing that it does so yeah that mini flavor is definitely there so uh what was i talking about \\nthe the acceleration the one pedal drive okay so the one pedal drive the thing you the thing about it is \\nthat sometimes with some of these systems is that they they\\'re quite abrupt at that slower speeds and \\nit makes it very difficult to maneuver and you know when you\\'re doing car parking or  tight maneuvering \\nor something like that because it\\'s just like on and off and it\\'s quite tricky to manage that so this system \\ni feel that is actually quite smoother and because of the way that they\\'ve done it um you\\'re able to \\nfeather the throttle and st uff like that so even when it\\'s creeping forward sometimes it creeps forward \\nsometimes it stops but you know that\\'s a good thing because it means you have to put the brake down \\nand you know that you stopped it and you hold it on the brake so actually it\\'s not a bad thing but i think \\nwith it overall it lends itself to a smoothness that is really good now i\\'m on a really bumpy road i\\'ve \\nreviewed this you\\'ve seen in some of my other reviews this road i bring cars here because this is \\nterrifically bumpy and sma ll cars really suffer on this road but this one is doing really well and i think \\nthere\\'s two reasons for that one is of course the lower center of gravity the weight is low down it\\'s very \\nrigid lower down so it\\'s holding down 16 and 17 inch wheels this is i think is a 17 -incher um they don\\'t \\ngo bigger than that because they find the ride is very fidgety and i will confirm that around town over \\nhere i\\'m getting bounced around a little bit as well but overall it\\'s actually quite solid and composed i \\nthink one  of the things about the mini is that it is quite solid around town it is a bit fidgety and a bit \\n\\nnuggety um and again i don\\'t put that down to anything that they\\'ve done to the suspension because \\nthey\\'ve obviously tweaked it i think i put it down to the usual problem that i\\'m finding with uh hybrid \\ncars electric cars where the batteries are in the the  platform of the car is that there\\'s an extra level of \\nrigidity uh and inflexibility that\\'s brought into it that i think somehow transmits more to the cabin i i \\ndon\\'t know i\\'m just finding that that\\'s the case i haven\\'t confirmed or denied that with an eng ineer but \\nthat\\'s my own perception that\\'s what that\\'s how i feel about it um so as you saw from that little drive \\nthere now we\\'re in traffic now so now we\\'re gonna i\\'m gonna go into no it\\'s in full regen mode i\\'m going \\nto leave it in mid mode because to be  honest there\\'s not that much to be gained from green i think the \\ngreen mode you go into when you know you\\'re starting to run low on range and you\\'re starting to get a \\nbit anxious and then you go let me just put it down into green and green plus and then g eek out a bit \\nmore so i\\'ve got the ac on and stuff like that so um i\\'m going to leave leave things as they are so in \\ntraffic in this sort of scenario is where these cars are best is what i\\'m beginning to learn and this one is \\nno different yesterday or the day before i took it for a long run from west london over to east london \\nalong the north circular long circular was typically very very busy on the way there and it was a lot of \\nstop go traffic now in stopgo traffic i found that i didn\\'t really lose that m uch range because every time \\nyou\\'re slowing down every time you\\'re stopping every time you\\'re using the brakes the regen is just \\nrecharging the battery and when the time i got there i was like oh okay you know i haven\\'t i haven\\'t it \\ndoesn\\'t equate to how m any miles i\\'ve done the range is showing the range that\\'s gone down is not the \\nsame as the miles that i\\'ve done which were greater so that was a good thing on the way back which \\nwas later in the evening the roads were more free -flowing so i was able to go you know that no circular \\nroad is about 50 50 miles per hour in some places so you\\'re able to go at that speed because the road \\nwas clear when i got home i had to use much more of the battery so that\\'s the funny thing about this \\ncar is like when you\\'re hav ing a nice clear run you end up using more of the battery and then when \\nyou\\'re stuck in traffic you actually use less of it so it\\'s kind of better for you that\\'s really weird isn\\'t it and \\nof course the thing is that time becomes a big thing with these cars  is that you have to start to calculate \\nin you know your recharge time you have to start to work out okay i need to allocate an hour 45 \\nminutes 30 minutes to spend some time recharging the car as i had to do today before i came out and \\ndid this so that\\'s t hat\\'s part of the process of owning and driving one of these cars and of course that \\nadds the time and then if you\\'re saying that will actually perform better in traffic well the traffic is taking \\nup more of your time and then you\\'re trying to find more ti me to then charge the car talk about electric \\ncar dilemmas so overall then i think the the thing about this car what i would say is that if you live in the \\ncity if the vast majority of your mileage is in town and thereby you\\'re in a big city thereby you\\'re  \\nnormally stuck in traffic then by all means go for this because it will ultimately i guess even though \\nyou\\'re paying more for the car work out cheaper in the long run if you do a lot if you spend a lot of time \\nand a lot of miles driving around town if not  then it\\'s hard to justify this car um over the petrol cooper s \\nespecially as i still think that the petrol cooper s is still slightly more engaging to drive although you \\nknow as electric cars go this one ain\\'t bad at all you know and look at this i mean l ook just dying through \\nthis roundabout you can you can steer it on the throttle it\\'s just you know you understand you pull it \\nyou pull the throttle back you can tighten the corner back on the power you know it does the mini thing \\nthat you wanted to do but i wish there was a little bit more that i was getting from the steering so that \\nwas that\\'s the only thing and i think that numbness comes from this now being an electric car so overall \\nthen i think a thumbs up for this car i think it\\'s actually really good  i think it\\'s really well done i think it \\nbows really well for the future of um you know mini and what they\\'re going to do with their cars um \\nwould i have one like i said if i lived in town if i had my own drive and i could fit a fast charger at home \\nso i could just keep it plugged in so not have to worry about charging it and stopping places to do that \\nmost of the time that would be enough like i said when i sized it up it gave me 114 miles rather than 145 \\nfor most of use that would be enough so it would w ork out um so in that sense yes i would consider it \\nand i think that this is something that uh definitely you should pull on your short list particularly if you\\'re \\n\\nin the market for an electric car but it ain\\'t cheap at least you don\\'t lose anything inside not that there \\nwasn\\'t that much space in the back anyway uh but that\\'s not what the mini is about anyway there you \\ngo there\\'s the review on the mini hope you enjoy ed that let me know what you think of the mini in the \\ncomments about

welcome back to the channel my name is marcus and here today in \\nfront of us is the first all -electric mini cooper it\\'s a mini cooper s and here in canada it starts at 39 \\nhundred and ninety dollars let\\'s get into it okay so startin g at just under 40 000 canadian this is actually \\nin fact one of the least expensive electric vehicles on the market today not only that it\\'s one of the \\nsmallest but there\\'s a trade -off here it also has one of the shortest ranges of any electric vehicle it\\' s \\nrated at around 185 kilometers of range and if you\\'re really booting it you\\'re not even getting close to \\nthat so we\\'re going to get into that this is basically the fully specced out uh premiere model as you can \\nsee it has these kind of lime green yellowi sh highlighter accents on it uh as well as a signature cooper s \\nhood scoop that is in fact uh doing nothing it\\'s that\\'s a fake that\\'s a fake scoop right there um a couple \\ndifferent changes on the cooper s versus the normal gas powered one because of the ba tteries as you \\nguys can see it actually sits a little bit higher up in ride height because you know to compensate for the \\nbatteries and some of the suspension components are carried over from the larger mini coopers but \\nlet\\'s go for a drive we\\'ll take it o n the road and see how it actually performs in real world conditions and \\nhow it charges et cetera et cetera let\\'s go for a drive all right here we go you guys this is going to be the \\nmost silent roads untraveled video ever but that doesn\\'t mean we can\\'t ju st mat it and go all out and \\nthat\\'s 120 kilometers an hour so mini cooper s this is not just any mini cooper s this is the very first all -\\nelectric mini product very exciting times okay when we basically the only i believe the only all -electric \\nvehicle we\\'v e ever reviewed on the channel was back in 2015 we drove thanks to uh see the sky exotics \\nand ali henderson we were able to drive a p85d a model s p85d uh when that was you know relatively \\nnew that was basically a brand new uh car it was the fastest tesla model at the time now in tesla\\'s world \\nkind of considered slow while not slow at all but that\\'s the context there since then i\\'ve driven a couple \\nof electric vehicles uh nissan leaf bmw 530e which is a plug -in hybrid so yeah you know drive around a \\nlittle bit on only battery power in that car but this is a mini cooper s but with no gasoline which is funny \\n\\nbecause immediately when you look at the car you\\'re like okay well it\\'s still you guys it still has a hood \\nscoop no it\\'s not pulling in any air though it\\'s actually just a blocked off plate but it still kind of has that \\nmini essence in that mini cooper s k ind of cool young hip look to it which you know these modern bmw \\nminis have been known for for quite some time now so like i said starts here in canada at 39 990 uh this \\none as we\\'ll get to in a little bit is pretty much fully specked out uh because it is march here in bc so this \\none has been given to us from mini with winter tires now normally this car would come with 17s \\nregardless across the board but this one is fitted with 16 inch wheels now i don\\'t know if these wheels \\nhave come off like some other mi ni product but i didn\\'t see them when i was on mini ci i did not see \\nthese wheels you were able to spec them on this car so that\\'s kind of interesting but just because it is \\ncold out we are running the winters and that probably will cut your range down a l ittle bit now like i said \\n181 horsepower 199 pound feet of torque uh and that doesn\\'t sound like a lot to me a gear head to you \\nguys maybe mini enthusiasts maybe not that may absolutely just sound like a laughable amount of \\npower and torque anything under 200 horsepower these days in my opinion just seems like not enough \\nit\\'s gonna be gutless but that is absolutely not the case not the case here in the mini cooper this is the \\nmost insane 200 pound feet you will ever experience in your life and i\\'m not exagg erating um see here \\nwe\\'ll slow down a little bit to about 50 kilometers an hour and if we mat it the tires are struggling for \\ntraction and that\\'s a hundred kilometers an hour so it\\'s not slow this is not a slow vehicle they didn\\'t just \\ntake a mini cooper a nd keep the s badge but then kind of dumb it down and expect you just to not know \\nit\\'s no it\\'s every bit as quick as your standard mini cooper s and in fact the 0 to 60 time is right around \\nthe same which is kind of cool now as you guys can see here a few things you don\\'t get with the base \\nmodel you do not get the heads -up display which has its own issues you do not get this larger 8.5 inch \\ntouchscreen with the base model but what you do get is of course the same range which is the biggest \\nuh the biggest up side with this car but honestly also the biggest downside with this car it\\'s only rated at \\naround 185 kilometers of range on a full charge however this morning fully charged we had it charging \\nfor you know 11 plus hours overnight and fully charged this mor ning it said i had a range of 170 \\nkilometers and on the left here on this lcd screen here you can see how much power i\\'m using with the \\nthrottle at any given moment and if you keep your eye on it you\\'ll see i\\'ll generally be you know at the \\ntop fifty perce nt of the power because it\\'s you know i\\'m driving a cooper s you don\\'t buy a cooper s and \\ndrive it like you do a nissan leaf which is i believe what the kind of target audience here that mini\\'s going \\nfor okay but let\\'s put it into perspective because the c ooper s does have many things going strong for it \\nas far as the eevee competition goes it weighs between three and four hundred pounds less than a \\nchevy bolt or a nissan leaf that inherently just will make it more fun and that is absolutely the case here \\nwell no not as fun as rowing through the gears in a gasoline -powered mini and it will never be as fun as \\nthat to me it is absolutely more of a driver\\'s car than any ev i\\'ve ever driven including that p85d but at \\nthe time the model s other than the straight line acceleration it didn\\'t really do much for me um but \\nhere as a city car this electric mini cooper ev actually makes a surprising amount of sense if and you \\nreally have to calculate how much your commute is and kind of how practical it is for your own l ife but if \\nyou\\'re only kind of going around the city and you can live with less than 200 kilometers of range it is a \\nfantastic option in the ev market especially for the price if you drive it like i\\'m driving it now at full \\nthrottle which is quite the expe rience honestly i mean we\\'re you can scoot along real quick real quick \\nespecially from a dig above 100 kilometers an hour it\\'s kind of a letdown that\\'s when it really starts \\ndying down and i actually believe that uh the mini cooper se has a speed limit and  for us gear heads this \\nis extremely important i believe this car actually has a speed limit or a hard cut at 93 miles an hour \\nwhich is slow that\\'s about 150 -ish kilometers an hour while yes here in canada that is well it over any \\nposted speed speed limit in the country and for us gear heads that doesn\\'t that that really doesn\\'t \\nmatter um so to see a 93 mile an hour hard cut limiter is kind of a disappointment but it is a cooper s \\nthat is not catered towards the gear head it just isn\\'t um it\\'s catered to th e less expensive lower end of \\nthe ev market but that being said when you test drive it it\\'s guaranteed this is gonna be way more fun \\n\\nthan a bolt or a leaf or any of the kind of lower you know the new hyundai i forget what it\\'s called but \\ntheir new electric vehicle guaranteed without question this is going to be more fun to drive on a back \\nroad because it does have such low range it does  have quite strong uh regenerative braking and it has \\ntwo settings for that now this is where i\\'ve totally yet to get used to driving evs as two settings one like \\nlet\\'s say i let off the throttle here at 75 kilometers an hour it\\'s going to kind of engine b reak while \\nrecharging the battery an hour down to 50 and 40. so it\\'s kind of slow right that being said it\\'s still like \\nmore of a stronger kind of engine break than most gasoline powers powered cars i drive and there\\'s no \\nthird setting there\\'s no like off there\\'s no true coast mode in this car the other setting is strong \\nregenerative braking which from 90k it\\'s it\\'s like you\\'re pretty hard on the brakes it feels like you\\'re hard \\non the brakes right but i\\'m not touching anything and the car will just come to  actually a full complete \\nstop and i haven\\'t touched anything so you can drive this vehicle with just one foot if you get really good \\nat it i still find it super weird i don\\'t like it i i go in the you know the low setting which maybe has \\ncontributed to th e lower range i\\'m experiencing but that being said it is worth noting um one other kind \\nof negative that i\\'ve noticed is regardless of the trim package you go with you don\\'t get adaptive cruise \\ncontrol which in an ev because you don\\'t have gears and becaus e you don\\'t have that just general sense \\nof how fast you\\'re roughly going at any given moment as you would in let\\'s say a manual transmission or \\neven an automatic where you feel it shift and you can hear the engine note roughly know what rpms \\nand what spee d you\\'re going it seems like adaptive cruise control would be just on the base model \\nbecause it is so hard if you\\'re not constantly looking at the speedo to really know how how quick you\\'re \\ngoing there\\'s no real sense of it just overall so that is definite ly a downside i have no idea why mini \\nincluded like the heads -up display but not adaptive cruise control seems strange to me but that being \\nsaid it is still a mini cooper s it is still fun to drive it\\'s got plenty of grip even with these winter tires on \\nhere and around the city like for its size and for the amount of torque it has there\\'s gonna be nothing \\nquicker basically around the city than this car you\\'re gonna get off the line and across the intersection \\nquicker than basically anything other than uh yo u know some of these other evs that cost way more it is \\nit\\'s it\\'s really remarkable how far 200 pound feet has gone uh in this car but all right let\\'s try and find a \\ncharging station and we\\'ll talk a little bit about the pricing and what options you get as  well as how \\nquickly you can charge back up and get right up back to that 185 kilometers fully charged range so let\\'s \\ngo see if we can find a charger [Music] okay so i already have begun to hate electric vehicles even more \\num that\\'s a lie i don\\'t hate them  but we are here here in south surrey british columbia at grand view \\nheights aquatic center and we\\'ve run into our first real world issue with electric vehicles now as you can \\nsee beside us there is a nissan leaf it\\'s kind of cool to see the competition he re and there\\'s two ev \\ncharging spots now we\\'ll go around to the back um and let\\'s open up the uh cap here get ready to \\ncharge right should be just that simple oh oh wait there\\'s no cable here so this this charging center at \\ngrand view heights aquatic cente r only has one of the charging cables installed so we physically cannot \\ncharge at this location even though i looked it up on google maps beforehand and it states there are \\ntwo charging ports uh and there\\'s there\\'s literally a cap on the bottom here so it is not possible for us to \\ncharge we were gonna yank the we\\'re gonna yank the cable out of the nissan leaf but kind of decided \\nagainst it it might not be the best idea so let\\'s hop back in the car hopefully we don\\'t run out of range \\nand go find another char ging location jesus okay so luckily we do not live in the middle of nowhere and \\nit only took about two minutes to find another charging port and this one ah thank god it actually has a \\ncable attached to it so we\\'re going to yeah we\\'re just going to plug it  in and i\\'m going to talk a little bit \\nabout what you have to do you have to tap let\\'s tap my visa here continue card is now authorizing this is \\nmy first time plugging in uh an ev at a public charging point okay so now it\\'s unlocked and we\\'re good to \\ngo br ing this around to the side here pop this open and here we go okay so basically mini cooper s e \\ncomes with from the factory just a level one charging cable right so that\\'s you could just plug it into your \\nnormal outlet at home that\\'ll take a crazy amount o f time even just to get you up to that 185 kilometer \\nrange it takes about i believe eight to 11 hours this should be a level two so many claims uh it\\'ll take you \\n\\nfrom zero percent to eighty percent in about four hours and then if you\\'re able to find a dc fast charger \\nthat will actually take you from zero to one hundred percent or zero to eighty percent uh in about 35 \\nminutes so that\\'s like crazy quick you can liter ally just you know do some errands go grocery shopping \\nwhatever get some food uh and 35 40 minutes later you\\'re back up to 80 percent so like i said it does \\nstart the base model here starts at 39 000 but this one fully optioned out is about 47 000 canadian  now i \\nwant to and this isn\\'t a knock on mini but it\\'s just to put things in perspective real quick for an extra four \\nto five thousand dollars you\\'re hitting a base tesla model 3 okay which has more than double the range \\nand i\\'m gonna leave it there that\\'s  all you need to know you guys can do your own research on evs \\nprices options but if you\\'re really looking for just a really small compact city ev i\\'d suggest you just go \\nwith the base model but if you need all the tech and you know the extra moon roof you  do get wireless \\ncharging you get a bigger lcd screen with this top model uh you get the heads -up display you get the \\naccents you get options for cool wheels there\\'s a bunch of things you do get but if you\\'re looking at the \\ntop model i would highly suggest  looking at some of those other evs with more than double the range of \\nthis for only you know three to five thousand dollars more it hasn\\'t gotten old driving a silent car like it\\'s \\nreally fun to drive like an uh and drive how i would drive a sports car wh ere normally that style of \\ndriving would get people to either call the cops or give you dirty looks or be like slow down in an eevee \\nnobody\\'s looking at you because they can\\'t hear you it is it it\\'s just the inherent stealthy nature is \\nabsolutely the numbe r one thing i love about evs um i do love evs as a daily now will i ever not own a \\ngasoline -powered car no i will own gasoline -powered cars for the rest of my life it\\'s kind of making me \\nnauseous though you guys and i\\'m not exaggerating the if you\\'re not u sed to it which i am absolutely \\nnot the sensation of just the utter smooth silent acceleration and torque delivery from like zero to a \\nhundred if you\\'re you know it can can get away from you real quick and you don\\'t realize how quick \\nyou\\'re accelerating bu t you do it enough like i\\'m beginning to feel a little bit you know unsettled in the \\nhead not not quite nauseous but uh you know approaching that anyways thank you guys so much for \\nwatching hopefully you guys enjoyed this quick review on the 2020 mini coop er s e be sure to subscribe \\nif you haven\\'t already hit that notification bell we just put out a video recently with an 850 wheel \\nhorsepower r35 gtr um and as well a 450 wheel horsepower sti we\\'re not going away from the modified \\ncars at all this year in fa ct we\\'re going to be doubling down both on the modified car stories as well as \\nreally only driving the manufacturer and brand new cars that we find really interesting and that you \\nguys may enjoy as well so thanks so much for watching we\\'ll see you soon [Mu sic] do you  \\n \\n \\nCar Model : 2021 Mini Cooper SE  \\nReview:  it\\'s a great time to be a car enthusiast in 2021 or even just in the market for your new vehicle \\nbecause we\\'ve got choices and i\\'m talking gasoline versus electric is it time to maybe hang up the \\ndinosaur juice and move to electricity or should you give el ectricity a few more years and go with a \\nmore conventional gasoline system so what we have here are two pretty much identical cars but they\\'re \\nunique in that as we talked about one is gasoline and one is a full electric vehicle let\\'s start with the \\nbritish  racing green one to my right this is called the mini cooper s jcw jcw is the john cooper works trim \\nof the mini cooper s and as such this is the performance version of mini\\'s little two -door hatchback \\nunder the hood is a turbocharged direct injected four -cylinder transversely mounted as minis have \\nalways been it\\'s uh powering the front wheels via a six -speed manual transmission imagine that in 2021 \\nyou can still buy a six -speed manual now this island blue mini is quite a bit more unconventional so a \\ncouple  years ago bmw launched the cooper s e e standing for electric and what they did is they started \\nwith a standard mini they ripped out the gasoline powertrains and instead replaced them with electrical \\nsystems so this one is powered by a 181 horsepower elec tric motor that makes pound -feet of torque \\n\\nthat\\'s made into a direct drive transmission so no gears to shift and it still powers the front wheels as \\nthe mini gods have intended now the batteries live underneath kind of toward the rear and as such it \\nsits about one inch higher to accommodate the lar ge battery pack still get all the same interior room \\nthough as the gasoline model so how far does this go on a single charge well the epa says 114 miles \\nwe\\'ve found through our testing you can stretch that more to like 130 or 140 if you drive it nicely but  \\nthe cool thing about these electric cars is that if you have a place to plug them in at home they\\'re really \\nreally convenient and cheap to use so for example we just plug this in we go home at night charge it up \\novernight wake up with essentially a full t ank now a full tank on the mini cooper s jcw well gas is getting \\nquite expensive if you run premium figure probably well over 40 dollars of course that\\'ll get you 300 \\nmiles or so a full charge on the cooper se well that\\'s only going to cost you a couple of  dollars depending \\non how much your electricity rates are at home charge time zone that\\'s another story on 110 this could \\ntake as much as a couple of days to fully charge on a dc fast charger zero to eighty percent in about 35 \\nminutes now most folks at hom e are gonna install a level two charger which is basically your dryer \\noutlet and that\\'ll take a few hours from empty to full but if you\\'re charging it overnight who really cares \\nnow comparatively the gasoline car of course is only going to take a few minut es to fill up which for a lot \\nof folks is very familiar and is a big advantage but another advantage for the electric one is there\\'s not \\nmuch to service on these ev cars there are no spark plugs change no oil to change uh brakes last a long \\ntime because of  regenerative braking and in fact the power train in this car is going on what is that eight \\nyears old nine years old so it\\'s pretty darn sorted i think that this one in the long term might even be \\nmore reliable than the 2 -liter turbo [Music] so behind the  wheel of the gasoline mini and let me \\nsomething straight right off the bat this car is properly quick it\\'s just a little 2 -liter with 220 horsepower \\nbut the car even though many folks say it\\'s gotten really big it still is remarkably small and compact and  \\nyeah when you put your foot into it it really takes off and of course being the jcw this car handles like \\nnone other it just grips the road steering is very direct not quite as playful as some of the older minis in \\nthe rear end coming around but still is a very very fun car to drive so that\\'s the good the bad is that um \\nit\\'s kind of soulless unfortunately a full disclosure i\\'ve owned a ton of these minis and this latest \\ngeneration which debuted in a 2013 called the f56 it just doesn\\'t have much pizzazz as some of the older \\nmodels and these new direct injected four cylinders make all their torque really low which is good for \\nkind of passing but when you get up high it\\'s not really z and this car\\'s got a lot of what they call rev \\nhang so going from shift to s hift it takes a long time for the revs to decay before you can actually rev \\nmatch to the next gear which is a real shame and kind of makes it frustrating to drive easy to drive as a \\nbeginner but as a more advanced driver it can be um a little primitive but  if you still want a really fun car \\nthat just absolutely zips along it\\'s hard to beat the cooper sjcw if you can afford the price tag so on the \\ninside these cars are well pretty similar a little bit different here and there now this is the john cooper \\nwork s model the sporty one so it\\'s got these very aggressive bucket seats i\\'d almost say too aggressive \\nfor daily driving especially if you are a larger big mac kind of individual but if you are looking for your \\nultimate track sporty experience this is definit ely it now it\\'s important to realize that um these mini \\ncoopers are kind of a hard thing to sell in america because they are like baby bmws they\\'re very \\nluxurious on the inside very well assembled on the inside but you do pay for it so for example this one  \\nhas heated seats got automatic climate control the 8.8 inch display all the materials feel super high class \\nthe snapple of the steering wheel is incredible but this car has an msrp of nearly 41 000 now you\\'re \\nprobably thinking well 441k could get one heck  of a veloster n or golf gti or even like a golf r and you\\'re \\nright yeah the value is a hard sell on these cars i\\'m not going to lie the interiors on these are better than \\nall the vehicles i just mentioned but from a performance or horsepower per dollar st andpoint those \\nprobably are better values now the mini cooper se is a little bit less aggressive on the inside compared \\nto the jcw because this car is more of a cooper s competitor which is like the slightly lower horsepower \\nversion of the gasoline car as such these seats are actually much better i just love this almost white \\ndenim material it really looks great very good seats very comfortable the bolsters still do the cool stuff \\n\\nthat they do on the jcw now the interior is almost identical if you\\'re looking at buying one of these cars i \\nstrongly recommend the lighter interior obviously it\\'s a little car and it really opens up the cabin the \\nsilver accenting across the dash is very s imilar now this is a signature plus it\\'s missing a couple of options \\ncompared to that one so for example no wireless charging in the center no heads -up display which is a \\ngood thing because i hate their heads -up display but it still has heated seats automa tic climate control \\nyou still the same level of quality the same dual sunroofs it really is quite nice in here so pricing wise this \\nis where things get a little bit interesting the cooper se starts at just under 30k it\\'s one of the most \\naffordable electric  cars on the market today this one with a bunch of options including this cool tri -color \\nroof 37 000 which sounds like a lot of money for a vehicle that goes 114 miles but once again because \\nit\\'s an electric car there are some benefits for example uh this car still qualifies for the federal tax credit \\nso you can get up to 7 500 back on your taxes on the federal side and then of course you\\'ve got the \\nstate incentive so in colorado uh for example because our liability for the company is more than 7 500 \\nwe get  the full federal and state so this car quickly becomes more like a 26 or 27 000 car versus 37 and \\nthen it becomes much more attainable which is kind of a cool thing time for the all -electric mini gonna \\nplant it not much happens until about 35 and then it actually takes off pretty decently mini says zero to \\n60 in 6.9 seconds now it may not feel all that quick from a stand still once you\\'re doing like 40 if you \\nplant it like it gives you a nice little shove in the back as you accelerate down the road of cour se \\ncompletely silent now there\\'s a lot less drama than the gasoline right no gears to shift there\\'s no sport \\nmode to engage with the exhaust or whatever there is a sport mode though which kind of sharpens up \\nthe steering and the throttle response but this is still a very fun car to drive and i actually think in a city \\nsetting in some cases more fun to try because you can really zip your way in and out of traffic and \\nthrough small areas without having to wait for the turbo to spool or having to change gear i  think in a lot \\nof ways this car is a better kind of replacement to the original mini which was intended to be an \\naffordable car to take people around and just happen to be fun now thirty thousand dollars doesn\\'t \\nsound very affordable for starting but when  you factor in the tax credits twenty or twenty five thousand \\nalready sounds a lot more affordable um and for the amount of fun you get it\\'s pretty good it\\'s really \\ngood now it\\'s not quite as sharp as a jcw and you certainly feel the additional i think it\\' s like 600 pounds \\nbut it\\'s a lot of fun still is a ton of fun from an exterior design standpoint very similar obviously different \\ncolors this jcw has a red roof which looks great and then against the british racing green it\\'s got a good \\nlook we also have d ual exhaust which has been a cooper s trademark since 2002 big diffuser along the \\nback and then up top giant spoiler now the cooper sc has got a little bit of a weird thing going on down \\nhere with the wheels these are meant to look like a british plug sock et from the uk which is why they\\'re \\nasymmetrical people either really love them or really hate them i\\'ll tell you that much but there are \\nother wheel options still have the union jack tail lights still have a small spoiler up here but then coming \\ndown to t he bottom no exhaust pipes whatsoever so they\\'ve completely gotten rid of the exhaust pipes \\nthey\\'ve made the cooper s badge this kind of limey green and then they put this electric badge on the \\nback and i think this is also optional depending on how you sp ec the cooper se [Music] all right so which \\none should you get the gasoline or the electric version of the mini cooper is it time times go eevee in \\n2021 now i can\\'t convince you that 114 miles of range is enough but it\\'s enough especially for a small car \\nthat\\'s built to go in the city and maybe the occasional day trip if you\\'ve got a place to charge it up at \\nhome there\\'s a good chance you\\'re not driving over 100 miles each and every day even on your longer \\ncommute so i kind of am leaning toward the electric  mini between the tax incentives the instant torque \\nand instant acceleration it\\'s a lot of fun now the gasoline mini is still brilliant but unfortunately the \\nmodern day engine they\\'ve really lost some of the soul and the pizzazz of the old one so i say giv e the \\neevee one a go as always this has been tommy with the fastlane car check out tflcar.com for the latest \\nand greatest in ev vs gas reviews  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW 320i  \\nReview:  \\nforeign the new BMW 320i M sport is fun and looks great but is it a serious competitor against the \\nluxury Rivals the Mercedes -Benz c200 and Audi A4 stay watching and find out I\\'ve always been a fan of \\nthe three series and back in the day it was often the entry to the brand for first time Beamer owners \\nback when they\\'re a fair bit cheaper and the one ser ies hadn\\'t arrived this is the 320i and it is the base \\nmodel but it will still cost you a healthy 79 000 before on -road costs the M sport variant comes with \\nsome great features like a mixed synthetic leather trim a 12.3 inch touchscreen multimedia system \\nApple carplay Android auto and a sunroof to name a few the full specs are in my written review at \\ncarsguide.com if you need more details for such a Sleek looking sedan it\\'s actually very generous up \\nfront I have plenty of head and leg room taller passengers  will also get excited with extendable under \\nthigh support and that you can set the seat to sit quite low my six foot two brother has a 328I and has \\nplenty of room you just will encroach on back seat passenger Comfort the trim on the seats looks great \\nbut they are very firm and you\\'re going to notice that along Roadie when you make a pit stop because \\nyou\\'re going to do lots of stretching but I do like that they have side bolsters that are adjustable because \\nthey really tuck you into a corner when you\\'re tac kling or Winding Road the storage is good for the size \\nof sedan but passenger space has been prioritized still what you do get like the glove box middle \\nconsole will suffice for everyday use the multimedia system looks fantastic and if you don\\'t want to \\nmuck around with the touchscreen you also have a rotary dial but all in all it\\'s a beautiful dashboard the \\nonly thing that I don\\'t love are the little prongs at the back that stick it up you don\\'t really notice it from \\nthe driver\\'s seat it has Wireless Apple  carplay and Android auto but the satellite navigation was also \\nvery handy to use the digital instrument panel looks really nice and I love the clear Head Up Display and \\nthe steering wheel feels awesome underneath the hands you\\'re also not going to have an y issues with \\ncharging up front with a wireless charging pad a USBC and a port and a 12 volt Port too the back seat \\nfeels cozy but I still have a decent amount of leg room and Headroom back here I am 168 centimeters or \\n5 foot 6 though so a taller passenger  may not agree with that assessment I really like the Practical black \\nheadliner and the hard kick plates I feel like they\\'re always good to have when you have pets or kids \\naround the lower ground clearance makes it easy for my six -year -old to climb in and out and the doors \\naren\\'t heavy to open either which is fantastic this has isofix child seat mounts on the outboard seats \\nplus three top tethers but it\\'s a narrow back seat and I would be considering this as really a two -seater \\nfor regular use and a three s eater only if you\\'re desperate plus I don\\'t think you\\'d be able to fit three \\nchild seats side by side anywhere the tunnel that goes through the middle of the floor does encroach on \\npassenger comfort for the middle seat like most sedans it can be a little b it fiddly to fit a harness \\nbooster seat just like mine because of where the top tether is it\\'s hard to get it tight however you\\'re \\ngoing to be hard -pressed to fit a zero to four rearward facing child seat if you\\'re a tall family the storage \\nis a little bit  lean back here but I do like the other amenities like the directional air vents climate control \\nwell positioned reading lights and two USBC ports the boot offers a good capacity of 480 liters and the \\naperture isn\\'t too narrow so if things roll to the back  it\\'s pretty easy to retrieve them I like that you\\'ve \\ngot the little storage pocket on the side and that this comes with some safety items like the first aid kit \\nand a reflecting triangle in case you get into trouble now this doesn\\'t come with a spare tire  or even a \\npuncture repair kit because the tires are run flats and because it is a base model it doesn\\'t come with a \\npowered tailgate but because it\\'s a sedan it\\'s not too heavy to operate [Music] this has a two liter four -\\ncylinder turbo petrol powertrain with a maximum output of 135 kilowatts and 300 newton meters of \\ntorque this one is a rear wheel drive and has BMW steptronic 8 -speed auto transmission which makes \\nfor smooth gear changes the engine has real kick and can go from zero to 100 kilometers per h our in \\n\\njust 7.4 seconds but hop in with me and let\\'s see how it drives foreign yes it\\'s powerful but this is \\nactually the smaller engine for the 3 Series range I think what I like most about the performance of this \\none is that when you put your foot down it respo nds eagerly but it\\'s not unbridled power there\\'s no \\nbucking at the front or shuddering through the steering wheel it\\'s controlled but very fun this handles \\nCorners really well with the lower center of gravity and coupe -like height meaning you can drive it a bit \\nharder than you normally would this has the M sport suspension which means it\\'s actually quite stiff I \\nquite like the handling but it does get a lot of talk back from the road unless you hit a really big pothole \\nit doesn\\'t really rattle you but it do es make for a harder ride and if you\\'re after the Comfort or the limo \\nlike ride of other luxury models this is not the car for you the 11.4 meter turning Circle and Sleek \\nDimensions make this very easy to park the nose is quite long but the front and rear parking sensors and \\nvery clear reversing camera makes this well let\\'s just say you don\\'t have many will I make it moments \\nthe official combined fuel cycle is 6.5 liters per 100 kilometers real world testing saw my figure at 7.4 \\nliters which I thought was r eally good considering how hard I drove it over a mix of urban and open road \\ndriving this has a 59 liter fuel tank and based off the official combined fuel figure you should be able to \\nget roughly around 900 kilometers per tank which is excellent if you do  Roadies like me as far as safety \\nfeatures are concerned this comes with some of the items I like to see on a family car and a highlight is \\nthe intelligent seat belt reminder and the SOS emergency call Button which when activated will alert \\nemergency servi ces to your location however I have to call out the lane departure and keeping AIDS \\nbecause it does work quite sporadically and once I noticed this I did test it quite extensively this week \\nand I do think that BMW needs to improve this on future installmen ts this has been awarded a \\nmaximum five -star and cap safety rating but it was done a while ago in 2019 it has seven airbags but it \\ndoesn\\'t include the newer front center airbag the full safety specs are in my written review at \\ncarsguide.com.eu if you need more details so what are the ongoing costs well the 320i comes with a \\nfive-year unlimited kilometer warranty plan which is standard for the class it also comes with either a \\nthree or five year cap price servicing plan and on The Five -Year Plan the services  are just 2150 or an \\naverage of four hundred and thirty dollars a year which is very competitive for this class like other \\nBMWs servicing intervals are condition based with the car telling you when it needs to be serviced I \\nhave thoroughly enjoyed my time in the BMW 320 IM sport this week it is bloody fun to drive and \\nhandles beautifully on the road the harder ride might not appeal to some but I didn\\'t mind it the Cozy \\nbackseat and boot does make me think that this will suit a smaller family best and one wh o\\'s not \\ncarrying around a lot of gear all the time but it suited my needs just fine if you\\'re after the cushioned \\ncomfort of a Merc this might not appeal but I do think that this will appeal to drivers who don\\'t want to \\ncompromise on performance but still have a kid or two in fact I kind of don\\'t want to hand it back this \\ngets a firm 8 out of 10 from me my kid really enjoyed being in this this week and thought it looked like a \\nsports car he gives it a 10 out of 10. if you\\'re after more details check out my full detailed written review \\nat carsguide.com and I\\'ll see you next week [Music] thank you  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW 320i  \\nReview:  \\nthis is the 2023 BMW 320i and you might be looking at it much as I did and think to yourself well that \\nlooks just like last year\\'s model and you\\'d be right apart from one or two small things but open the door \\nand you\\'ll see that there\\'s been one very big c hange this is four wheels in a seat my name\\'s Alex \\nDalrymple and this is the channel where you can see new cars reviewed every week but in order not to \\nmiss one you\\'re going to need to subscribe so please hit that button down below and if you enjoy the \\nvideo give me a like as well the 3 Series is probably BMW\\'s safest and most plain looking car I mean \\nthat\\'s partly by design it is their top selling non -suv vehicle after all but it\\'s a Timeless design that has \\nevolved in similar proportions and size over the  last 30 years so what\\'s new on the outside well there\\'s \\nnew headlights the bumper is new and The Grille has changed a bit although it has managed to miss the \\nM3s giant snout from the side there\\'s really no mistakingness for anything other than a BMW 3 Ser ies \\nit\\'s such a classic shape we\\'ve got new 18 -inch Alloys this year done in bi -color alloy and they are \\nwrapped in Michelin run flat tires the back of the three series pretty much the same as it was before \\n\\nwith a 480 liter storage space here in the boot and under the Bonnet we\\'ve got a two liter four -cylinder \\nturbo petrol engine which outputs 135 kilowatts of power and 300 newton meters of torque shooting \\nthis car to 100ks per hour in an okay 7.4 seconds alt hough it does feel a little bit quicker than that in the \\nflesh fuel economy comes in at 6.5 liters per 100 kilometers on a combined cycle and all the power is \\ndriven through an 8 -speed automatic transmission to the rear wheels only once you step inside tho ugh \\nthat is where you\\'ll see the biggest change in this year\\'s 3 series with the all -new dashboard design \\nincorporating operating system H which is being progressively rolled out across BMW\\'s entire range it\\'s \\nbasically two large LED screens joined togethe r in a single curved display the center console screen runs \\nall of the infotainment just as you\\'d expect but the previous version of this software was already class \\nleading so BMW have had to work really hard to try and improve it with mixed results becaus e it has \\nnow become so complicated that it can be hard to find basic functions like this home screen where you \\ncan customize your most used widgets is fantastic but if you go into the main app screen here you\\'ll see \\nit\\'s just a mountain of icons and to try  and find which one you need can be a nightmare the other day I \\nwas trying to increase the brightness of the head up display on the windshield it took me ages to figure \\nit out and in the end I ended up using a voice command to do it for me just because it was so \\ncomplicated and I\\'m wondering if BMW are actually deliberately sending us in that direction on purpose \\ncould be should you just want to ignore a lot of the apps you can of course wirelessly connect with \\nAndroid auto and apple carplay as well moving down the console the climate controls that were here \\nhave been removed and put into the center console screen same as the numbered shortcut buttons \\nthat used to be down underneath that they\\'ve been replaced by some basic audio system controls and \\nfront and  rear D Mister buttons we\\'ve still got this cubby here which houses the wireless phone \\ncharging a USB port and a couple of cup holders the lower console here is mostly unchanged from what \\nit was before fans of the job wheel will be happy to know it\\'s still  here in the 3 Series you can still \\ncontrol the center console screen manually with this wheel plus the shortcut buttons are there too the \\nmain difference though is of course that the gear shifter the gear stick is gone it\\'s been replaced by this \\nlittle le ver here that you use to put the car in drive or reverse we\\'ve got the powered park brake of \\ncourse the drive mode buttons just the same as they were and under the center console all bin lid here \\nis a relatively small storage space with another USBC head -up display on the windshield has been \\nredesigned slightly I like it you can customize the information that appears on there just as before the \\ndigital instrument cluster is all new as well there are a few different display modes linked to whatever \\ndrive mod e you\\'re in and they all look really good I think it\\'s actually a much more contemporary and \\nsharp design than it used to be before the only thing that doesn\\'t seem to be here that used to be here \\nwas maps you can no longer have maps on display right in fr ont of you but you can have them \\npermanently displayed on the center console screen if you like this steering wheel I\\'m just not a fan of \\nlook I know it\\'s a typical normal BMW steering wheel it\\'s in pretty much every car they make but it just \\nfeels a bit t hick in the hand and it\\'s just a bit too big you know this is such a dynamic car that\\'s so much \\nfun to throw around on a twisty country road but having a smaller wheel would just be awesome but \\nyou know it is what it is it\\'s not horrible we\\'ve got paddle s hifters on on the wheel as well to change \\ngears manually if you like audio system and cruise controls are here too the seats are leather with suede \\naccents they\\'re very comfortable and they hug you in very tightly especially with the adjustable bolsters \\nhere in the driver\\'s seat there\\'s full electric adjustment and the seating position is really low and sporty \\nin the cabin but it doesn\\'t impede your view out the front at all I can see pretty much right to the front \\nof the big Bonnet and there\\'s good visibil ity in the rear Vision mirrors the wing mirrors are a little bit on \\nthe small side but they are okay the materials in the cabin much as they were before still soft touch up \\non top here we\\'ve got a nice detailed aluminum feature here in the middle and down in the lower \\nconsole gets a little bit hard and plasticky underneath the Belt Line and we\\'ve got some nice leather \\nwith blue stitching here on the doors so all up a very nice cabin to be in okay let\\'s see what it\\'s like as a \\nback seat passenger in the back  of the three series and look it\\'s not huge but it\\'s doable I\\'m behind my \\nown sitting position 190 centimeters tall my knees are into the back of the seat in front of me but this \\nplastic shell here has a sort of curved in feature so there is a little bit o f extra room there but I would be \\nasking the driver if they could slide their way forward just a little bit we\\'ve got a separate zone of \\nclimate control back here and two more USBC ports a couple of air vents of course Headroom a little bit \\n\\nlimited and dark headliner does sort of make it a little bit dark back here there is a sunroof there but \\nwell just at the moment anyway it\\'s not really helping light things in the back seat very much the seats \\nare very comfortable though armrest with a mec hanical cup holder for two cups I haven\\'t broken it \\nthat\\'s good um look all up it\\'s actually very comfortable back here this car has so much go it\\'s so Lively \\nand although it\\'s been a while since I drove the 420i coupe my memory of that is that it was a li ttle bit \\nbreathless and sort of not struggled but just wasn\\'t as good as this this feels actually much better I was \\njust reading on LinkedIn this morning on the BMW channel that they are actually running a competition \\nat the moment with game developers to come up with some games that can be played on operating \\nsystem eight on here on the center screen using your phone as a controller now this is obviously \\nsomething Tesla have been doing for a while using the steering wheel as an input but I\\'d be very curiou s \\nto see what BMW comes up with so well made and so solid in some ways you feel a little bit like you\\'re \\ndriving a brick down the road and I don\\'t mean that in any bad sense it\\'s just it\\'s so flat and so glued to \\nthe road that it almost feels immovable but  yet it is so Dynamic around corners and stays so flat with \\nzero body roll we\\'ve GoPro the great thing was with sport individual mode is that you can configure it to \\nchange a few of the settings around now look it\\'s not nearly as configurable as say in M3 but there are a \\nfew things you can alter like the steering the drivetrain and the transmission select whether they\\'re in \\nComfort or sport mode the change on the Driving Experience isn\\'t as pronounced as it is in some other \\ncars but still noticeable the sus pension though is not adaptive you get what you get and it is reasonably \\nfirm but the trade -off is of course those fantastic cornering capabilities it is really quiet in here though \\nlike I can\\'t hear the engine at all um which you know when you put your fo ot down you do like to hear a \\nbit of engine noise but it\\'s there it\\'s just not very loud I think this car\\'s best noise actually is when you \\nfirst turn it on there\\'s something about the sound of a BMW starter motor it just sounds so impressive \\nthat and clos ing the doors because they make a really nice solid noise this car also has a feature called \\nparking assistant where it will remember the last 50 meters of driving input before you park your car so \\nif you get into a really tight spot and you\\'re not sure ho w to get out the car will do it for you released \\nfive years ago the 3 Series BMW is probably due for a bit more of an extensive overhaul but it\\'s fantastic \\nperformance and updated Tech still make it one of the best sedans you can buy foreign  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW 320d  \\nReview:  \\nI\\'m Nikki Nash as always and today you guys join me my my latest test car this is the BMW 320d and it\\'s \\na very good looking vehicle so I\\'m going to tell you every single thing you need to know about this \\nvehicle from the extra look of the vehicle the inter nal look of the vehicle the drive and cost of ownership \\nof the car so extra look at the vehicle as much as this is in front it has all the Chrome detailing I thought \\npersonally I wouldn\\'t like it but seeing it in person and having lived with it for a coupl e of couple of days \\nI actually like this over it being blacked out it gives off luxury it looks quite beautiful especially with \\nthose with this color I like the look of this vehicle in front in front BMW made significant changes so you \\nget a different type  of bumper design at the lower end different type of Grill but the main change is on \\nthe terms of the lives the lives look beautiful I like the the look of those kind Farms so this car next to \\nthe face live side by side preface lift owners would look at th is and get helped and get hard to \\npalpitations because of how much this cars look so good in front I like the the overall design in front at \\nthe back there\\'s minimum there\\'s minimal defense just the bumper where the plastic finish and I \\npersonally am not a  fan of that one behind the cameras also not a fan of that so I feel like BMW could \\nhave tried a bit more in terms of making it the faceless vehicle by changing the lights although I feel like \\nthey did change their lives but they put a bit more effort beca use it takes a lot of people and I myself \\nalso didn\\'t know the difference between this one and the preface lift until I saw the bumper design at \\nthe back but without the bumper I cover the bumper you all know you won\\'t know it\\'s the facelift until \\nyou look  in front or in in in terms of the Interior when you get the nice flat screen TV inside and \\nspeaking about the flat screen TV inside time to speak about the interior and you know what for that we \\nneed to jump inside so you can see the TV screen I\\'m talking  about so getting inside the vehicle you get \\nthis nice beautiful touch screen interface so let me put that connect my phone so you guys can see how \\n\\nbig the Apple carplay and Android auto is there we go so you get this nice big interface you get your \\ndigital um instrument cluster over there and then there is so much you can do in this vehicle and like I \\nsaid in my X1 review you need as an owner you nee d to find time give yourself 30 minutes of the day \\nget in this vehicle see what it has and as you can see this getting there there is so much things you can \\ndo this vehicle and unfortunately I cannot cover that in this review but I\\'m gonna show you the the  \\noverall design of the vehicle in terms of how build quality is the steering wheel feels good as much as it \\nis thicker than the C -Class I personally liked this one but I like the suit plus more because it just feels \\nmuch better and it has a different type of finish here and here in the c -cloud like it\\'s like it\\'s like it has \\nholes for like a better term but that\\'s what it goes the interior but build quality the BMW feels much \\nbetter the C -Class doesn\\'t feel as good as the BMW so I like that about the BMW BM W Supreme in that \\nregard um one thing I like that I that I missed in the X1 is the snub the snob that controls the whole \\ninfotainment system I do not have to go fiddle there although I can fiddle there like that I\\'d rather prefer \\nusing the swivel knob but interior it\\'s that big TV screen what I don\\'t like climate control system is within \\nthe infotainment system and I feel like they could have kept it here although you do get a in terms of \\nslightly so you get like Max front or Max rear that\\'s in terms of if it\\'s raining and you need to demist \\nthat\\'s all you get and then you have your your normal volume button your track selection next then you \\nget your your hazard thing over there so that\\'s it I wish the climate control system was fitted here as \\nwell because I do not like it being there but it goes to that it\\'s all I can complain about in the interior the \\nseats feel good much better than the ones found in the C Class C class I struggled with the corrective \\nposition but in this vehicle I did not struggle at all  but overall interior wise for me I prefer this vehicle \\ninterior wise exterior I prefer the C -Class I\\'ve told you about the interior let\\'s speak about cost of \\nownership and overall my driving Impressions then cost of ownership and then I\\'ll tell you betwee n the \\n320d and the c220 which one is a better offering and which one I personally would go for so you guys \\nJade me inside the BMW 320d from a driving impressions of the vehicle and I need to speak about my \\nfavorite thing about this car is The Shield effici ency so should be seeing another play video now got this \\nvehicle at around 900 kilometers to to empty took it up to a thousand and that\\'s something very \\nimpressive I\\'ve been averaging around four the same thing as averaging on the X1 I was averaging \\naround  4.0 liters or 4.2 in this vehicle the highest I went even putting foot to metal this vehicle the \\nhighest you\\'ll ever see is around a 6.2 6.7 at Max in this vehicle but I\\'m not so in this vehicle it\\'s a two \\nliter turbo diesel engine producing 140 kilowatts  and 400 newton meters of torque so it\\'s direct \\ncompetitor as the Mercedes -Benz c220d that I had on test last year Link in description box below so that \\nvehicle produces seven more kilowatts and 40 more newton meters of torque although it might not \\nsound a s much I don\\'t know how Mercedes made got it but in this view you can feel the difference in \\nthe Mercedes that the Mercedes is putting out a bit more power so the push you do feel that you can \\nget it in terms of fuel of the Mercedes run about the same thin g with this vehicle it has a mild hybrid \\nassistance as well so it has that whole fancy things of switching off the gearbox when the engine when \\nyou Coast it so by the end of the day goes down to perfect so this vehicle is selling point over the \\nMercedes -Benz for me it has to be the build quality inside and the diving abilities of it in terms of the \\nhandling it feels for me personally it feels much better than the C -Class and Mercedes -Benz is known for \\nfor for the luxuriousness of the vehicle but in that see k in that specific C -Class or the AMG line is a bit \\ntoo bouncy it\\'s a bit too not firm per se but you feel every road imperfection whereas in this one as \\nmuch as you do feel the running Perfection it handles it much better Theron is much lower as well \\ncomp ared to this obviously like speed UPS right now I\\'m going in this vehicle I have I have not scraped \\nany speed hump whereas in the C -Class I\\'ve scraped countless of times but it all goes down to way \\nMercedes -Benz decided to take the approach of the vehicle in terms of its looks Aesthetics they\\'ve went \\nthrough that whole young S -Class Vibe but keeping it low to the ground in that instance but driving \\nDynamics this is where BMW claims that in terms of Shield driving plays a hands they call it they\\'re in \\npleasu re it\\'s because it\\'s so nice to drive as much as this vehicle is not a performance variant of its of its \\num I mean it\\'s in its range it gives off so much in terms of the handling cornering curves it gives you so \\nmuch confidence there\\'s a as as a driver and  if you keep the traction on and put it in sports and go into \\ncorners or all of that the traction assist you so much so that you don\\'t end up losing it um it cuts in but it \\ndoesn\\'t cut into a point where you feel like the power Cuts whereas in the C -Class the traction Cuts but \\n\\nat the same time it cuts the power of the of the car it cuts the power so that it can regain control and it \\ngives you the power again in this vehicle it does not do that it manages the traction for you but \\nobviously you as a driver you\\'ll be doing what you \\'ll be doing it handles that for you but you don\\'t feel \\nthe surge of power Cuts but in the seeking the C class that happen quite quite frequently so it\\'s \\nsomething I didn\\'t I did not like um but at the end of the day if you want to do stuff like that you j ust put \\nthe attraction off um but I don\\'t recommend doing search unless if you know what you\\'re doing but now \\nit\\'s time to speak about my recommendation and this is something where it\\'s very tricky um but for me \\nI\\'ll tell you which one is my personal favor ite between the two vehicles and then sum up the review \\ncause the ownership and all of that and then yeah it\\'s attempt to move on to the next segment so now \\nwe add the final part of my review it\\'s where I speak about cost of ownership and then I wrap it up  with \\nthe question you guys are asking yourself c220d or 320d um cost of ownership this vehicle if you finance \\nit at an interest rate of 12.25 with no deposit over over a period of five years at the current at the \\nlaunch price of this vehicle at 930 000 Ra nd before options you\\'re looking at twenty one thousand five \\nhundred Rand Factor fuel into that you should be paying around one four one five for a few of this \\nvehicle so you\\'re essentially looking at the vehicle is looking at just under 23 000 Rand but at  most 20 \\n000 including monthly repayments and fuel for the month because I do not think you need to pour \\nanother full tank when you get a thousand kilometer range in this vehicle um obviously with insurance it \\ndepends on the type of person you are I myself  I know for Effective and showed this this car I will not \\nget anything under under a thousand rent so you can easily go to 24 25 event but check out the \\ndiscovery show for that then insurance for a reason tell them I send you and you get an insurance quote  \\nand then that\\'s it so with regards to that important question c220d or the BMW 320d personally they\\'re \\nall going down to perfect which one you\\'d go for but as an overall vehicle right being biased at which \\none you like more aside pound for pound the overa ll better vehicle for me having tested both vehicles it \\nhas to be this vehicle it offers more than the Mercedes -Benz in terms of comfort which that\\'s very \\ncontroversial Comfort looks subject to Interior feel of the vehicle that\\'s a superior even the someth ing I \\nstruggled with in the six hours of driving the driving comfortability in terms of the seat position this is \\nsuperior handling in terms of driving this is superior but the C -Class is still an amazing vehicle and as \\nmuch as I\\'ve been saying so much abo ut this vehicle I we still take the c220 because the car looks so \\nbeautiful um is where I lie towards like I lean towards the c220d but pound for pound this is a better \\nvehicle um hence why you see this vehicle so many of these vehicles I get it um but ove rall for me \\npersonally c220 but I wouldn\\'t be mad if I got this vehicle and I didn\\'t buy the c220 so I don\\'t mind it it\\'s \\na good vehicle good offering if you as a buyer opt for this one it\\'s good if you opt for the c220 it\\'s good if \\nyou come to me and say Nikki will chat should I buy I will say my brother close your eyes point in the \\ndirection wherever you end up take that vehicle because both vehicles are good offerings vehicles and I \\nhave to end the review there comment down below which one you would go f or since you know what I \\nwould go for and we\\'ll take it on in the next review what\\'s my next review um interesting next video is \\nnot on this channel it\\'s on ignition Channel 189 all things motoring catch me at Festival of Motoring this \\ncoming weekend and y eah if you want to see me come to Festival of Motoring I\\'ll be asking questions \\ndoing all the fun things behind the camera and I\\'ll see you there but yeah I\\'m signing out  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW 320i  \\nReview:  \\nhello everyone and welcome back to the channel where today you join me out in another BMW and this \\none has been very kindly supplied by the guys and girls inch Cape BMW Chelmsford um if you don\\'t \\nalready follow them give them a follow they sometimes have s ome really nice cars in the showroom and \\nthey\\'ve currently got a really light cast really nice customers car uh 2002 turbo um so if yeah if you\\'re \\nlocal head down have a look uh they\\'ve got some nice M cars in at the minute new x5m yeah lovely cars \\nbut big  shout out to them for supplying me with the car today do some filming on this um this very nice \\ndravic gray 320i touring so yeah it\\'s not it\\'s still an M sport car but it\\'s not obviously an end performance \\ncar so we\\'re not going to go uh driving out as mu ch as we do in the other videos sort of like looking the \\nperformance side of things today it\\'s just going to be sort of looking more at the the touring features of \\n\\nthe car and we\\'ll still do a little bit of driving it\\'s I\\'ve driven it out here it\\'s quite a nice drive actually to \\nbe fair uh nice and comfortable nice and refined now being the 320i model it\\'s got the two liter \\nturbocharged engine under the Bonnet uh cou pled up to an eight -speed automatic gearbox b h b that \\nmeans you\\'re going to get some lovely MPG figures on the long run on the motorway um even around \\ntown I think it\\'s pretty good as well because of the gear ratios and I think it runs in quite a high gea r \\nprobably fifth gear at 30 miles an hour um 184 horsepower from the engine you\\'re not going to be \\nbreaking records on it but it\\'s a nice little bit of poke to it if just for the people that want to know I think \\nthe notes to 60 time you\\'re looking at about  7.8 seconds so not too bad really for the size and weight of \\nthe car um yeah it\\'s not extra IV either it\\'s rear wheel drive so yeah not too bad really now for the free \\nseries touring you\\'re probably looking at just shy of 40 000 pounds for a base model bu t this being the \\nM sport uh 320i touring with the dravic gray metallic paintwork because it\\'s got a very nice bronze flake \\nto it I really like it um and I think everything inside is pretty standard except for the black vanasca \\nleather with the gray stitchi ng that\\'s another optional extra but one of the other main reasons for \\nfilming this car today is because it has the new operating system eight or I drive 8 system with the new \\ncurved display which is first come out on the some of the eye electric eye cars we\\'ve seen it in the new \\nM3 touring and now it\\'s starting to trickle its way down into the lower the lower model ranges um so \\nyeah I\\'ve been playing with that on the way out so we\\'ll jump in and we\\'ll have a better look at our \\nsystem now I\\'m gonna have to be quick when I jump in the car here because it you get a nice little turn \\nand a little display on the uh the heads up display when you sort of open the car to greet you which is \\nsomething new for the operating system so if we\\'d be quiet [Music] and that\\'s  it um just little little \\ntouches like that which makes um getting in a car a little bit nicer for the interior of the car nothing has \\nreally changed as such it\\'s your standard BMW layout you\\'ve got the hard drive selector knob in the \\nmiddle as per usual y ou you\\'re all your electric parking brake there\\'s an auto hold button which I haven\\'t \\nseen on any M car before so I don\\'t know if this is a standard feature on sort of um lower spec cars um \\nlike the 320 to 340i and things like that I don\\'t know if that\\'s s o basically all it is because it\\'s an old Mac \\nuh when you select when it\\'s on it holds the car in uh so when you\\'re in when you\\'re in Drive normally \\nwhen you let your foot off the brake the car starts creeping that auto hold feature will stop that car \\nfrom  creeping as soon as you let it off it will start to roll forward um so it\\'s kind of good I guess in a way \\ndepending on what kind of driver you are um yeah the this that the layout down there is all pretty much \\nthe same the only thing I don\\'t like is the a ctual gear selector um it\\'s like a little tab now rather than a \\nphysical uh knob I guess um which I would prefer that I like a physical knob um not just so much it\\'s \\nsomewhere to put to put your hand I guess when you\\'re driving um but for me it\\'s like an a esthetic thing \\nas well I\\'ve it looks quite nice just a bit more character in the cabin I guess um with this new curved \\nscreen um this new iDrive system they\\'re going for a more minimalistic approach and a lot of car brands \\nare doing that nowadays I persona lly I\\'m not a fan like I just said I prefer a physical button so along this \\nbottom row of here where your climate control settings um your buttons are normally are they\\'re not \\nreally a physical button anymore they\\'re more touch and now we just have sort of  your next track or \\nprevious track buttons and your window screen window clearing buttons for the climate control your \\nactual climate control settings are on this Sub menu up here you\\'ve got sort of your passenger and your \\ndriver\\'s side dual climate settin gs but the actual climate control is on this Sub menu and it\\'s all touch \\nnow my biggest bug with these and I\\'ve driven a they\\'re even coming out on Vans now is that with a \\nphysical button you don\\'t have to look away from the road when you\\'re driving to fin d what you want \\nwhereas these new touch screens you haven\\'t got the button to sort of locate it by muscle memory \\nyeah other than that we\\'ve got a lot more wraps and it looks like if we go on the home if we can get \\nthere now there\\'s a lot more apps on the i Drive system as well so as well as as well as Apple carplay \\nwe\\'ve got I\\'ve got Android auto which is new and it looks more like a tablet or a phone so Spotify is \\nalready in there as standard um yeah if we go down it just looks more more like a more like a phone app \\nthan driving settings and everything are all in there in there as well so I like the new layout it\\'s pretty \\ncool uh I guess it would make it more user friendly to anyone new to the BMW World um make them \\nfeel a bit more easier rather than before some of the BMW menus were quiet it was a sub venue under \\na sub menu under a sub menu um but I think whereas this is going to be a bit more of um quicker and \\neasier to work your way around now as well as a steering wheel steering wheel is pretty much the s ame \\n\\nlike I said it\\'s Auto so you\\'ve got some Flappy paddles on the gear stick and on the steering wheel um \\nbut other than that everyone everything\\'s pretty much the same now if we just start the engine um this \\nBeastie two liter into life [Music] so again if yo u go through the sport comfort and Eco Pro modes the \\ncolor will change of the heads up display and we get a nice red and spoke for like an angry fiery mode uh \\nComfort is like a nice neutral color I guess something like a beigey gold bronzy color kind of go es with \\nthe the flake in there in the paintwork to be fair and an Eco Pro we\\'ve got a nice blue now again you\\'ve \\ngot some nice funky heads up display uh we\\'ll go through the content menu just like that we get you \\nMaps you sat and have sort of Direction you \\'re going in um some warnings and prompts and then just a \\nbasic Speedo down at the bottom there is a default meter which Everyone likes a G -Force meter on \\ntrack I\\'ve never been a lover of Paul she\\'s an Audi\\'s Sat Nav where it\\'s built into the instrument cl uster I \\njust think is a bit too much going on sometimes or it\\'s not quite as clear but it seems like BMW have \\nnailed it the way it sort of fitted in there and yeah I really like this it\\'s definitely something I could use in \\nthe future now being a touring y ou can\\'t not have a look in the back of the car um space wise with the \\nsame driver\\'s position the seat left in the same driver\\'s position that I\\'m in I\\'ve got plenty of room the \\nseats kind of rested back a little bit for more driver comfort and it\\'s not in  my face um you\\'ve got some \\ndual climate controls well sorry climate controls down here um as well as a lot more sort of Headroom \\nin the back and where you\\'ve got that extra bit of boot space in the back before the body starts sloping \\ndown which is nice as  well now if we come around to the back of the car again being a touring I actually \\nnever knew this was a thing until I got shown it this morning but the window pops open which is pretty \\ncool for quick and easy access tuck every anything in that down there  like that but then like like a \\nnormal boot electrically assisted we open it up you\\'ve got the full 500 liter capacity boot space with \\nsome small bit of understood from underfloor storage and then a nice sort of cover just to tidy up any \\nany of your stuff that you don\\'t want on display um yeah so little bits and Bobs like that but yeah actual \\nstorage size isn\\'t too bad and that is pretty much all of the touring features so what we\\'ll do we\\'ll jump \\nin the car and then we\\'ll go for a drive so straight away th is just being an M sport touring rather than \\nrather than more refined there\\'s less road noise I mean if you compare this video to other videos I \\nprobably don\\'t filming on the same GoPro you can probably be able to tell that there\\'s a lot less cabin \\nnoise g oing around like this road noise um so that\\'s that\\'s nice just for them days when you\\'re feeling a \\nbit control just woken up and on an early morning and you\\'ve got to drive to work and when the radio \\nyou can\\'t be asked for radio you just want a bit of peac e and quiet it\\'s not it\\'s not can\\'t have much to \\ntalk so you can just sit back and so again driving around town and the country Lane\\'s light I\\'ve been in \\nEco Pro mode um and I\\'ll just switch it up into sport as we get into a national speed limit apart 320 eyes \\nno sport exhaust system it\\'s not valve or anything like that so you don\\'t you\\'re not going to get like an \\nincrease in noise um but put it into Sports modes with a gearbox and just downshift a little bit and you \\nmight be out here that I want to go you might be able to eat ninja snow is there\\'s a little there\\'s a little \\nraspy there a little something yeah I feel it\\'s too quiet for a while though but yeah 320i on the auto \\ngearbox it changes nice and smoothly there\\'s no judderiness or anything like that I think because \\nobviously it\\'s a smaller gearbox and a smaller engine less power you\\'re not going to get them kangaroo \\nin effects when driving around town so it\\'s sort of a nice all -round gearbox um but it does pick up pretty \\nwell even in like obviously you\\' ve got your your Eco confidence sport mode so whatever mode you\\'re in \\nreally Eco law in sport or manual shifting in sport yeah it\\'s still still quite nice even wanting to sort of \\ndrive it in a fairly spotty manner around the lanes the actual handling of th e car is pretty good I can\\'t \\nfeel any major role in the Bodywork I\\'m not going around corners sort of hanging out sort of rolling \\naround the place the chassis itself is handling handling the road pretty well but these standard seats um \\nthey\\'re not they\\'re nothing special they\\'re just the standard things that you get in the car and they seem \\nto be holding holding me pretty well now as I said at the beginning of the video this I\\'m not driving this \\ncar as much as what I have in other videos because I feel like  this is in the car where I\\'m trying to put the \\ndriving performance of the car more more of the actual features of the of a touring um but I\\'m liking to \\ndrive in this car and I think it would make it good but it\\'d be a perfect daily car and it\\'s um good si zed \\nfamily car as well I mean that\\'s what BMW is good at especially when it comes to their torrents though \\nbring that towards or is one of the best ones you can get but my little S Bends here where I currently am \\nI test room it\\'s off wafted through it nice  and comfortable no roll you can feel it sort of take the take the \\n\\nbumps pretty well now I\\'m going to test the suspension here because there\\'s one bump here and every \\nend cut you saw here and there\\'s a bit oh so yeah that\\'s quite um we can still feel the bump obviously \\nbut I think I found out about this engine is in the l ow gears once she\\'s sort of start accelerating you get a \\nbit alone on the engine if you love The Frog here\\'s a nice little bit of Turbo flyer which is quite funny \\nquite cute yeah it\\'s little things like that that I find interesting with cars they\\'ve all go t their own little \\ncharacteristics now with this new iDrive system it\\'s not something that\\'s new to the eye I drive a they\\'ve \\nstarted implementing voice controls in um for the generations about I guess um I drive software um \\nyeah basic command for it if I think I\\'ve watched the channel if you haven\\'t back in the m135i video \\nthere was a feature where you could say BMW revitalized me and what it would do is kind of I will say \\naircon with you and sort of raise the volume of the music so basically if you just g et tired so I think the \\nBMW voice started coming out with these sub features now on this one as well as the driver good stuff \\nand you can adjust the air con temperature you\\'d say I\\'m cold or I\\'m hot and it will increase or decrease \\nthe temperature accordin gly just by voice commands now on this I found it um was that it can tell the \\ndifference between whether it\\'s the driver that\\'s asked for a commander or the passenger so if the \\npassenger says they\\'re hot or cold it will activate the Dual climate control an d adjust there there side of \\nlike temperature we don\\'t put passenger driver side which I think it\\'s really fair and really cool um so \\nyeah things like that people are always thinking of these new ideas and stuff which is quite cool and \\ninteresting but at t he same time you think you press that button and it\\'s done but yeah like this cool one \\nI love technology in the way it\\'s advancing in cars and stuff and how do you know yeah things like that I \\ncan appreciate it so final thoughts on the card I actually real ly like it it\\'s comfortable it\\'s quiet it\\'s fairly \\ntame um performance wise it\\'s not too bad there\\'s a little bit of gold there um but the economy I think \\nis probably one of the main features why you need to get a free Twitter touring um so in my whole sor t \\nof time with the car driving when I picked out this morning it was on a 180 mile range um I\\'ve probably \\ndriven in total maybe about 50 miles by the time I all Pan the car back um bearing in mind that\\'s been all \\nmanner of driving through town eco mode spo rt comfort revving it a little bit for video\\'s sake and it\\'s \\nstill saying 137 miles of range so it\\'s pretty pretty bang on with the figures and I think more likely to give \\nmore than 40 miles on a long run I reckon it\\'s very achievable so that is me pretty much done for today \\nI\\'m on my way back to hand the car back to indicate BMW if you don\\'t already give them a follow on \\nInstagram they have some pretty they have spring or events going on from time to time and they have \\nsome nice cars and stuff as well that  is very nice um yeah give them a follow let us know down below \\nwhat you thought of the 320i touring and what you think of the I drive 8 system and full screen is a bit \\nuh love and hate with some people some people feel like like I said I\\'m a sucker for te xt I like that no \\ndoubt I\\'ll be working with them again shortly and I will see you on the next one pretty soon cheers \\nforeign  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW 320i  \\nReview:  \\nthe bmw 3 series is kind of unashamedly the benchmark of the premium midsize sedan segment at least \\nuntil we get it up against the w206 c -class but here on chasing cars we\\'ve never actually done a proper \\nvideo review of the base model 320i and if the 3 ser ies is going to carry that accolade forward of being \\nthe best in class then that means the 320i has to be pretty good so in today\\'s video we\\'re going to be \\nfinding out whether this is worth considering in your next purchase now this 320i starts from about \\nseventy thousand dollars before on -road costs here in australia but the particular example we have is \\noptioned up to closer to eighty thousand dollars it\\'s got the visibility pack which adds a sunroof laser \\nlights and this sapphire black metallic paintwork  and it\\'s also got a comfort pack which adds heated \\nseats adjustable lumbar among other things that will get to a little bit more in the interior and that \\nmeans it\\'s actually a fairly expensive 3 series it\\'s right up there with the base price of the new me rcedes -\\nbenz c200 which is about 78 900 before on -road costs and it\\'s a lot more expensive than a base model \\naudi a4 so does it deserve to command that premium over its rivals and is this 320i with its passive \\ndamper set up any good to drive all of those th ings we\\'re going to be finding out in today\\'s video and of \\ncourse if you\\'ve got a 320i or are considering one i\\'d love to hear your opinion in the comments section \\n\\ndown below but if you\\'ve already heard enough about this 3 series and want to check it out some more \\ni\\'ve dropped a link below this video where you can access the configurator see the brochure and even \\norganize a test drive with chasing cars so the g23 ser ies has been around for a while now but i happen \\nto think it\\'s still one of the best looking in the segment personally i like it more than the w206 c -class \\nonly the alpha julia takes the biscuit for me over this car but still the proportions are just right  and even \\nin this black sapphire metallic paintwork that i personally wouldn\\'t choose i think it does a good job you \\nget 18 inch alloy wheels and an m sport kit as standard though as a non -cost option you can choose to \\ngo for the luxury line of this 320i a round the rear it\\'s a 3 series it\\'s the sedan as i mentioned at the top \\nyou can get a touring if you\\'ve got to put something like a labrador in the back or you need to carry a bit \\nmore gear obviously it\\'s more practical but this sedan is what most of the b uyers opt for here in \\naustralia and opening this power operated tailgate which is part of that comfort pack i mentioned \\nearlier you get a 480 liter boot which is a really decent size but there\\'s not that much smartness going \\non back here there are two litt le cubbies off to the side with netting but there\\'s no cargo net and there\\'s \\nnothing underneath the boot floor just a battery no spare tire um yeah which is common for bmws but \\nit is a bit unfortunate in a country like australia so you can let me know if t hat affects your purchase \\ndown below so the 320i probably wants the forgotten base model 3 series but now it doesn\\'t feel that \\nway at all now i\\'m going to talk you through why it starts with a technology package it\\'s pretty much the \\nsame as every other 3 s eries you can get 330i m340i as well you get this 10 and a quarter inch \\ntouchscreen up here which is super crisp decent to look at nice bmw graphics and you also have \\nwireless apple carplay and android auto you can control that through this rotary controll er as well down \\nhere which is great for the bumpy roads that we have in new south wales victoria and in fact all over \\naustralia just gives you that extra little peace of mind speaking of that interacting with the car on the \\nwhole you\\'ve got this sort of mi ssion control section down here where you\\'ve got drive modes traction \\ncontrol parking sensors auto engine start on and off and it just feels well thought out it\\'s the same with \\nthe buttons on this rather thick leather pointed steering wheel which i don\\'t l ove holding but it all feels \\nin the right spot all the controls fall to hand really easily the paddles as well the indicators you know it\\'s \\njust exactly what you expect and i think that is why this is still the best selling vehicle in this premium \\nmidsize sedan segment it outsells the c -class and the audi a4 here in australia it\\'s only outsold by the \\ntesla model 3 interestingly which it was done by quite comprehensively last year but anyway we\\'re \\ngetting off track a little bit now the tesla does bring me a little bit back to the technology package here \\nbecause still a sore point for the bmw range is this 12.3 inch digital drivers display it looks fine but in the \\nworld where these things are so high contrast and so capable and interactive with the driver like  new c -\\nclass and audi\\'s digital cockpit the bmw one just doesn\\'t have enough crispness or contrast to really \\noffer a full experience in this car i think that\\'s really something they\\'re gonna have to address in the \\nmidlife refresh of this car which is proba bly due fairly soon actually now let\\'s talk about the specification \\nof this car as well because it\\'s black outside and it\\'s black inside hashtag boring now you can go for some \\ndifferent leather colors as a no -cost option with this vanessa leather you can g et a really nice terracotta \\nsort of brown color you can also get oyster and i believe you can get red as well so you can snazz this car \\nup a fair bit but this feels kind of like you know like a salesman\\'s mid -spec luxury car and it does a good \\njob of that the black\\'s obviously super easy to clean you\\'ve got this sort of tetrahedral aluminium \\npattern here as well which is a little bit trippy to look at but looks fine again as you know tom i\\'m sure \\nwould go for the wood trims which are a no -cost option you ca n get oak wood veneer and ash i think so \\nyeah you could probably do that if you want to give the interior a subtle lift but what this car does have \\nis ambient lighting and it\\'s set to orange which is the only color for ambient lighting in my opinion so \\nyou can leave your comments on that down below whether you think that\\'s correct or not but it\\'s just \\nso old -school bmw and it just has that real sense of me feeling at home in here from being in bmw \\nproducts for a long time it just sort of all makes sense fin ally we\\'re going to come to the seats and these \\nseats are actually really nice they definitely don\\'t feel like a base model car seats now some of that has \\nto do with the options package so the comfort package gives adjustable lumbar for driver and passenge r \\nwhich is nice but from standard they are electrically adjustable with two position memory and they have \\ninflatable bolsters to help hold you in on a twisty road which i think is really great the driving position is \\nalso total absolute three series down i n a nutshell it feels so right long and low with the steering wheel \\n\\nright in front of me and i\\'ve even got my little sliding under thigh supports to give me a little bit of extra \\ncomfort which when you\\'re six foot two really does help out so i think on the whole then i\\'ve answered \\nthe question on whether this three series feels like a forgotten bass model because it doesn\\'t it still feels \\nlike it has a really good spot in the range at least from inside the cap the back of the bmw 3 series has \\nnever really been the place you want to be now this g20 grew a fair bit replacing the f30 but it\\'s still not \\nthe greatest place to be like i\\'ve got a decent amount of knee room but my toes are pretty tight under \\nmy driving position and although my headroom is sort of just enough the real problem with the 3 series \\nis that because you\\'ve got this big transmission tunnel and really high center seat it kind of is only a \\nfour -seater you can fit someone in here in the middle for shorter journeys if they\\'re not too tall but for \\nany long -haul stuff you\\'re going to want to cap it at four people w hich is a bit weird given you know you \\ncan get the four series grand coupe and you get the swoopy koopa lines outside but as you saw when i \\ntested that car a couple of weeks ago you don\\'t really sacrifice any rear space so yeah i\\'d probably go for \\nthe 4 se ries grand coupe but you can let me know down below what you reckon at least the rest of the \\nstuff back here is really nice you\\'ve got still soft touch materials back here you\\'ve got a nice solid feeling \\ndoor card with a little bottle holder there flip dow n armrest you\\'ve got two cupholders in the middle \\nthere nice and easy to put away maybe if i can do it and then adjustable air vents and they\\'ve got their \\nown climate setting back here and also two usb -c ports so in terms of technology and equipment back \\nhere it\\'s really good also the seat for the outer seats are really comfortable nicely inclined backrest and \\nsupportive squab it\\'s just that yeah not the greatest spot for five people but if you\\'ve only got four no \\nproblems the adr combined fuel consumption figure for the 320i is a pretty efficient 6.3 liters per \\nhundred kilometers servicing is due on a conditions based model and the three series will prompt you \\nwhen it\\'s time to go to the dealer for some maintenance now a five -year service plan is gonna cost  you \\none thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars for the basic and you can pay a little bit more to get cover \\nfor the brake rotors pads and the windscreen wipers over the last 12 months the medium budget direct \\ncustomer paid 1 386 dollars to comprehensive ly insure their bmw 3 series now your premium may vary \\nbased on things that insurers take into account such as where you live your driving history and whether \\nor not you garage the car and finally the warranty the bmw 3 series is covered by a three -year un limited \\nguarantee here in australia which is two years behind the new industry standard over five years \\nunlimited kilometers that mercedes audi and jaguar have all moved to recently so we\\'d love to see bmw \\nstep up to the plate there so the base model bmw 3  series before a 320i might have been fitted with \\nsomething lovely like a straight six a two liter or a 2.2 liter example but since the f30 it\\'s been a two liter \\nturbocharged engine and you know is that a bad thing i don\\'t think so this b48 that gets a lot  of use in \\nbmw products is again here fantastic no issues with it it\\'s got a really decent power band although in \\nthis trim level with 135 kilowatts of power and 300 newton meters of torque it doesn\\'t have any where \\nparticularly in the rev range where it f eels stronger and right up the top it does run out of puff a little bit \\ncompared to the more powerful tunes because of course this is the same basic engine that is found in a \\n330i which makes 190 kilowatts of power and has a lot more grant but do you need that power to bring \\nthis car alive not really because it\\'s just got a really nice chassis i should also mention how smooth and \\nsilky this zf 8 -speed gearbox is i don\\'t know what bmw do but they blow everyone out of the water \\nwhen it comes to tuning of this  gearbox like even companies like jaguar that use the same basic gearbox \\ncan\\'t seem to make it as silky and delightful as bmw do in here and yet when you\\'re in manual mode \\nshifting with the paddles it\\'s super responsive and pretty quick like sharp on those  shifts sometimes it \\ndelivers a nice wallop as you shift into the next gear and you go oh nice am i in a sporty vehicle no it\\'s \\njust the base model 3 series now of course it does have an msport kit and it does have pretty sporty \\ntires on it so these michel in pilot sport 4s are a really lovely bit of rubber now unfortunately on this \\nbmw they are run flats which goes to say why there\\'s no spare in the boot of this car the idea is you can \\nrun on them when they\\'re flat if you need to not recommended still and s o for that reason i think \\nthey\\'re still a bit pointless and i know bmw loves doing them it\\'s a safety thing on the autobahn i\\'m sure \\nbut yeah in in practice they\\'re a little bit stiff and i think they contribute to this car\\'s slightly stiff -legged \\nride now  i\\'m not saying this thing rides terribly honestly it\\'s still one of the best in class but there\\'s some \\nareas where it just seems to pick up these little notchy bumps that you didn\\'t necessarily see on the \\nroad and compared to some of the other bmws includ ing the 330i and even the 420i it just feels a bit \\n\\nmore stiff -legged a little bit more brittle when it hits a bump and i\\'m not sure why that is now the 330i i \\nknow has adapted dampers but i just think bmw may have skimped a little bit on the damper package \\nfor this car the spring and damper package and alm ost for the reason to make you buy a 330i would be \\nthe cynical thing to say i don\\'t know do you need to buy the 330i though i don\\'t think so not for the \\nadaptive dampers necessarily but it does yeah you do get a lot of extra silkiness with that car and i t hink \\non balance i\\'d rather spend the money on the adaptive dampers and the extra money on the 330i rather \\nthan specking this car up with the sunroof with the metallic paint and the laser lights because for me \\nthat\\'s going to be more bang for my buck but of  course everyone\\'s a little bit different but thankfully \\nwhat the adaptive dampers don\\'t mean is that this car is no good in the corners because oh my \\ngoodness the bmw 3 series is still i think the class benchmark it is such a great car to drive on a twist y \\nroad it may look unassuming in this black paintwork with the 18 -inch alloy wheels the m sport kit is \\npretty pretty snazzy looking but yeah just the agility of this car is so surprising and the first time you get \\ninto it when it\\'s in comfort mode and you\\' re just cruising along it doesn\\'t necessarily give off the vibe \\nthat it\\'s going to be an absolute shredder in the corners but man when you get into a flow on a country \\nroad there are few cars better to be in than a 3 series even a base model 320i it just t ips in so \\ndelightfully you can feel the transfer of weight from slightly front lead a little bit of understeer as you \\nget back on the power and generate that gentle oversteer and even this 320i can do little slides the \\ntraction control is also fantasticall y calibrated in this car to give you everything you want and nothing \\nyou don\\'t and i think the engineering mouse of bmw really really runs deep in knowing how to make a \\ncar like this drive so fantastically so yeah i know you hear us wax lyrical about these  three series when \\nwe drive them on a twisty road but honestly the c -class has a real job cut out for it if it\\'s going to be \\nbetter than this and i know i\\'ve heard tom\\'s chats and we both agree that we really need to get them \\ntogether to do a back -to-back to see whether the w206 is finally better than the g20 so hopefully we\\'ll \\nhave that now one thing that w 206 does have that\\'s a little bit better than this 3 series is the safety \\nsuite now the base car doesn\\'t get the full highway driving professional pack age or rather the adaptive \\ndriver professional package but you do get adaptive cruise control and a lane keep assist system and \\nthat stuff works pretty damn well it all feels nicely integrated into the driving experience just like all \\nother bmws you\\'ve got  your little configurable safety system switch as well so you can have it like how \\nyou like you know early or late intervention and all that sort of thing so that\\'s great and i really like that \\nsimplicity of use and that sort of pervades the whole three se ries experience as i discussed in the cabin \\nthe thing is just so easy to wrap your head around and i guess to answer the question is the three series \\nstill the king of this segment it doesn\\'t feel old yet so we\\'ll have to find out maybe the new c -class wil l \\nabsolutely give it a thrashing but yeah we\\'ll wait and see so that brings me to the end of driving the \\nbmw 3 series which is always a slightly sad affair but of course as always let me know in the comment \\nsection down below any opinions you have about th e bmw 3 series do you think it\\'s been knocked off by \\nthe new c -class or do you think the audi a4 is better or something that i haven\\'t even talked about \\nperhaps the gorgeous alpha julia give me your opinion in the comment section down below and while \\nyou\\'r e there leaving your comments also we\\'d love it if you could hit that subscribe button and the bell \\nicon if you haven\\'t done so already and as always thank you for watching

gentlemen and welcome back to another video today we have the 320i zanzi edition so pretty much \\nwhat\\'s different between this one and the normal 32 0 is you get a whole bunch of different kits around \\nthe cop so first of all in the front we get a carbon fiber front lip which at the moment we don\\'t have they \\ntook that off just like customers don\\'t scrape it on speed bumps and stuff we also do have the l ights that \\ncome in the kidney grilles in the front and then move to the side then we get the red brake calipers then \\nwe move alongside the car we do have the black side skirts at the bottom right over here gives the car a \\nbit of a lower wider stones we the n also have the carbon fiber mirror caps as we move to the back of \\nthe vehicle we then get a another piece of carbon fiber this time in the form of a boot spoiler we also \\n\\nthen do get our blacked out tailpipes and it\\'s the usual familiar 320i behind but we move in front of the \\nvehicle over here we go inside we do also get the m sports seatbelts when we have the amazon\\'s \\neditions you also get your nice comfortable seats with alcantara inlay and obviously your bmw m colors \\nand blue stitching other than that we are greeted by a very familiar three series interior very luxurious \\nvery comfortable and an absolute dream to drive another thing you get with them zanzi edition is the \\nkidney grill lights these are little lights that are up here in the grill and you can see it at night and it gives \\na really really cool look to the car what we also have is an active kidney grill from bmw this means that \\nwhen the car is off or cold the kidn ey grill stays closed in order to ensure that the car\\'s engine heats up \\nproperly when the car then reaches the correct running temperature the fins open up and allows the \\ncar to breathe [Music] ladies and gentlemen welcome to the interior of the 320 i\\'m zo nzi edition as a \\nnormal 3 series would be it is extremely comfortable very luxurious and just overall one hull of a car to \\nbe in and it is just one hull of a daily driver that is what someone would buy this car for you can take out \\nno questions asked you h ave a really good looking car that is going to take you wherever you need to go \\ncomfortably you have a lot of space it\\'s a big family car obviously it\\'s not supposed to be an x -car so it \\ndoesn\\'t have that much space but i mean for what it is it is a fantas tic car it definitely has enough power \\nto drive around the city drive around the highway that is not a problem it is just one heck of a well -\\nrounded car and the zanzi edition just brings a little bit more spice to the regular 3 series the regular 3 \\nseries can look a bit boring and dull they\\'ve definitely been upgraded since the newest model which is \\nthe g20 they\\'ve definitely made a lot of cool interesting fun improvements over the previous generation \\n3 series but the zanzi edition puts a whole bunch more s pice on top of that and gives you a front lip \\ncarbon fiber bits everywhere it just overall it turns the car into something a lot more special a lot more \\nunique and something that just overall looks way better so the zanzi edition is specifically for the so uth \\nafrican market this is not sold anywhere else in the world so if you live in another country besides south \\nafrica sorry for you you will not be able to get your hands on one of these but yo i think it\\'s just one of \\nthose great things that have come fro m the country um not a lot of well it\\'s not burned to politics that \\nwouldn\\'t be good so a big question on everybody\\'s mind would be how fuel efficient is the 3 series so \\nthere are three variations of the 3 series you get the petrol the diesel and then you get your sport \\nmodels which is then the 340 etc etc this is the 320i so it is a petrol car so obviously it\\'s not going to be \\nas fuel efficient as the diesel but the big question is how fuel efficient is this car well at the moment i \\nhave reset the trip com puter since we left the dealership this morning and we\\'re sitting at about 11.8 \\nliters per hundred which is actually horrific i was getting about 12.8 or so in the m140r that i had a while \\nback but you have to keep in mind that the car needs to run in this  car is brand new it\\'s got 230ks on the \\nclock so it\\'s going to get better and at the same time all i\\'ve been doing is i\\'ve been driving around \\ntaking photos i\\'ve been driving around city driving which is like first second third fourth fifth it does not \\nget into eight gear which is the most efficient gear so the driving that i\\'m doing at the moment is not \\ngoing to be in favor of field efficiency in fact it\\'s actually in favor of comfort and pure photography -ness \\nwhat\\'s up ladies and gentlemen welcome back to  the interior of the 320. we have been driving it for a \\nwhile we\\'ve completed a couple of photo shoots with a car which hopefully they came out well as usual \\nand as expected it is a very nice car to drive we\\'ve actually managed to get the fuel consumption down \\nto 8.4 liters per hundred i think earlier i said it was 11 or something so we\\'re improving we\\'re improving \\nslowly very comfortable i was just saying i\\'m so glad we have an automatic because my car my personal \\nvehicle is a manual so the traffic would h ave been absolutely horrendous if we were stuck in that now \\nthanks to low shedding what a what a nice car it is an absolute breeze to drive do think that the m sport \\nlogo the m logo that comes out of this door i think that is part of the zanzi package ther e\\'s a point that i i \\nthink i need to make with this car it looks like a really sporty car it looks really good but this is not a \\nsports car this car does not perform like it looks like it should when buying a car like this when buying \\nthem zanzi edition wi th all the extra trim with the spoiler with the the red brake calipers and everything \\nit can be a little bit deceiving because there are no performance mods it is all just cosmetic and at the \\nend of the day this car i suppose you could say it\\'s raisa becau se it\\'s got all the go fast mods you know \\ngot the the red brake calipers the diffuser it\\'s all just cosmetic stuff obviously but it\\'s got all these mods \\nthat make it look like a real sports car and make it look like it\\'s got some some meat to it you know b ut \\nat the end of the day at least the the petrol is a it\\'s a two liter motor yes this turbo charge still just a \\n\\nthree series it is a family car or is the car that will take you to work and back there\\'s nothing extra that \\nyou\\'re going to get in terms of speed and performance if that is what you think you might get with this \\ncar maybe this is not quite the car for you  then you just got to keep that in mind that all the mods that \\nthe car does have they are purely cosmetic and does not add any performance whatsoever this car \\ndoesn\\'t even have the performance gearbox so we don\\'t get any panel shifters or anything if you w ant \\nto shift manually you\\'re going to have to use the gear selector yourself otherwise yeah it\\'s just a \\ncomfortable car it\\'s comfortable to cruise in the hallway um at the moment we\\'re actually getting 7.4 \\nliters per hundred which is not so bad we\\'re gonna  keep driving enjoy the car and let\\'s see what \\nhappens all right so we offer highway just a little update on the fuel consumption we are currently \\ngetting 6.2 liters per hundred so it\\'s really not bad as soon as you hop onto the highway but other than \\nthat oh it\\'s not exactly good like i say my car okay i got a 1.6 diesel but i get about four point four four \\npoint three liters per hundred combined yeah so it\\'s getting better it\\'s getting better guys we are gonna \\ndo some tests to see exactly how this car per forms against bmw\\'s stated numbers so we\\'re going to be \\nlooking at the zero to 100 times maybe even the quarter mile times depending on where in mexico we \\nare exactly i\\'ve got my draggy set up we\\'re just going to go find a road now and then we are going to  \\ntest exactly what this car does 0 to 100. so bmw claims that this car does 0 -100 in 7.2 seconds now bmw \\nare known for understating what their cars can actually do be quite interesting to find out what this call \\nwill do considering the fact that it is not a performance car so it is not meant to do crazy numbers at the \\nmoment it is about 18 and a half degrees celsius we\\'ve got a bit of cloud cover so it\\'s perfect we\\'re going \\nto go and do a photo shoot after this so the weather is just fantastic for what we w ant to do we just \\nneed to find a spot where we can start this [Music] all right guys so that one we actually did a zero to a \\nin 8.31 seconds so not quite what i was not quite what i was hoping for that\\'s not actually quick at all \\nhopefully we will find a b etter set of numbers now when we tried again would take two so i\\'ll see you \\nwhen we do that let us try this again we\\'re gonna reset the draggy oh that was much better let\\'s see \\nwhat we get there we go oh what did we get oh we didn\\'t even worse that time i thought we did better \\nwe actually got an 8.9 second zero to 100 that time so yeah we\\'re not exactly getting any better well \\nwe\\'re going to give it one last one last shot okay so we\\'re gonna reset okay one two ladies and \\ngentlemen phone disappears come on t here we go okay here we go we did it now we need to retrieve \\nthe phone somehow and then find out exactly what we did so we did 0 -100 in 8.38 seconds once again \\nnot quite what we were looking for so the big question is is this car worth getting and the answ er is yes \\nit is this car is for the person that just wants to commute to work and back or go out to the family this is \\na family car and it is so good at what it needs to do and that is to be comfortable to be efficient to have \\nspace and it has all of those  things the only problem that i personally find with this car is that it just does \\nnot have the power that i would want in a car at this price bracket i\\'m obviously the type of person that \\nwouldn\\'t go out and spend all this money on a brand new car i\\'d rat her spend this amount of money \\nand get a secondhand car with like 15 20 000 k\\'s on it and get something with a lot more power get \\nsomething a lot a lot younger and a lot more spirited it just feels like a good car so there\\'s there aren\\'t \\nany complaints rea lly there\\'s nothing to complain about with this car it just doesn\\'t have the \\nperformance that i personally would be looking for in a car but having said that if you are the type of \\nperson that just wants a car to drive around go to work and back go out to the family this is the perfect \\ncar for you i think that\\'ll be it for this video thank you very much for watching don\\'t forget to like and \\nsubscribe now that we have the draggy we\\'re going to be doing a lot more videos in the coming weeks \\nhopefully we\\'ll ge t a chance to take the m4 arc for another drive find out exactly what that does and \\nthen from there hopefully the next one just keep running in  \\n \\nTitle: \"Comprehensive Car Reviews 2023\"  \\nSubject: \"Expert reviews and detailed analysis of 2023 car models\"  \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW 320i  \\nReview:  \\ng\\'day i\\'m paul i\\'ve always liked the bmw e30 i think it embodies what bmw\\'s about small light fun and \\njust really enjoyable to drive this is kind of the same formula it\\'s fairly light it\\'s rear -wheel drive and still \\n\\nhas that fun to drive character it is the bmw 3 series this one in particular is the cheapest one you can \\nbuy it is the 320i this competes with things like the mercedes -benz c -class and the audi a4 and i guess \\nyou could also say it competes with things lik e the tesla model 3 as well if you want to go down that \\npath this is priced at just under 71 000 today we\\'re going to do a detailed review of this car if you want \\nto skip ahead to other parts of the review you can use the time codes up on the screen there or if you\\'re \\non youtube just scroll down and use the chapters below and if you haven\\'t done so already please make \\nsure you subscribe to our channel and press the bell icon so you can find out every single time we drive \\nbase model cars let\\'s talk exterior so you\\'ve got six external colors to pick from all but white is an \\nadditional 1500 bucks the only problem is the 1500 bucks doesn\\'t really get you a very good paint job if \\nyou look closely here it\\'s really quite wavy and you know in those back corners ther e you can just see \\nthat it\\'s really i don\\'t know just not a very impressive paint job at all so i\\'d be pretty disappointed if i \\nspent just over seventy thousand dollars on this plus the on -road costs and had that paint job so anyway \\nif you put that to one side though in terms of the design itself i think this car looks fantastic so bmw has \\ngone off on a bit of a design tangent at the moment with things like the m3 and the m4 the new 2 series \\nthey\\'re just i don\\'t know being very adventurous with design and i  think this sticks to that traditional \\nform looks quite aggressive but on the same token it\\'s still quite stylish so this one here is the m sport so \\nit\\'s got that m sport package you can get this in a luxury line as well which kind of gives it that slightl y \\nclassier look but the m sport really just gives it that aggressive overtone without sort of being over the \\ntop now down the front here you\\'ve got these active vanes these are actually designed to stay closed \\nuntil the engine reaches operating temperature  that way it\\'s more efficient and then they can open \\nwhen additional cooling is required so it\\'s all part of aero and efficiency which is why they bother with \\nall that stuff you\\'ve got a bit of chrome around that piano black center section and then down he re \\nyou\\'ve got more inlets for cooling headlights you get standard led headlights with matrix led this car has \\nthe optional bmw laser headlights we actually shot a video where we compared laser headlights to \\nmatrix led and standard led and halogen if you wa nt to watch that video click up here we found the \\nresults pretty interesting especially with bmw laser headlights now around the side here we\\'ve got 18 \\ninch alloy wheels i quite like the look of these so you\\'ve got that sort of brushed chrome look on the \\noutside a bit of graphite on the inside there quite a classy looking wheel and then with the m sport \\npackage you get m badges everywhere so one on the side there one on the wheel um the brakes look \\nkind of small this is the one thing that that i kind of don \\'t like the bigger the wheel size you go on bmw\\'s \\nunless you\\'ve got an actual full fruit m car you get these really small looking brakes looks okay here with \\nthe 18 but keep in mind if you do option bigger wheels it\\'s going to look kind of strange with tin y brakes \\nin there in addition to that the side profile of the tyre isn\\'t too big now this is a curious point because \\nyou can get adaptive damping with the 3 series but this particular car doesn\\'t have it so i\\'ll be curious to \\nsee whether this is firm becau se that\\'s one of the biggest hang -ups i have with bmws they\\'re beautiful \\nto drive but if you\\'re not smart with the options and you don\\'t get adaptive damping on some models \\nthey can give you a backache so let\\'s see what it\\'s like when we hit the road but u m i\\'ll reserve judgment \\nuntil then we\\'ve got an optional sunroof fitted to this car and if you come around to the back shark fin \\naerial at the top there these beautiful looking led tail lights i love that frosted look it really makes this \\nstand out at nigh t time 320i badge you can de -badge the car as well so generally if you see one of these \\non the road without badges it means it is the entry level because people don\\'t want you to know that \\nyou\\'ve got the entry level but um yeah that is an option if you\\'re mindful of that kind of thing two real \\nexhaust pipes as well which is kind of cool let me know what you think of the design do you think the \\nthree series still looks good do you think it looks better than the e30 or do you think the a30 will remain \\none of the best looking bfws let me know what you think down there we\\'re inside the three series let\\'s \\nstart off with the key here it is so unlock lock is the bmw roundel there boot and then you have the \\ndiamond or what they call that that is the the rhombus i do n\\'t know what that is anyway that down the \\nbottom that illuminates the car so you can spot where it is and down the side there you\\'ve got m \\nbadging because this car has the m sport package and then blank on the back um it\\'s a proximity sensing \\nkey so you c an just leave that in your pocket and then once you\\'re inside you have a push button start \\ndown here now let\\'s talk styling so being german it is slightly bland but what they\\'ve been able to do \\nand i quite like this is break up the black with some of these  brushed chrome highlights it\\'s like an \\n\\naluminium finish but probably plastic so instead of just being all black and dreary it is actually kind of \\nvibrant and it pops a little bit there\\'s minimal use of piano black thank goodness but one of the \\ndownsides is they\\'ve gone with this matte plastic f inish and it looks okay but it just is a tiny bit cheap \\nyou can get as an option on other bmw vehicles metallic finishes on the buttons on the steering wheel \\nand some of the buttons down here so probably an option to think about speaking of options the stu ff \\nthat we\\'ll talk about today is on this car at the moment some of the features will be optional i\\'ll point \\nout whatever i can that\\'s optional but keep in mind if you are ordering this just triple check what is \\nstandard and what\\'s optional don\\'t take ever ything that i say here as gospel because it might be \\ndifferent in your country or even in australia where they have different package options now what \\nabout the materials around the cabin so all of this stuff here is soft touch it\\'s like a rubber finish th en \\nyou have these sort of cold to the touch finishes and then you get a sort of slightly harder plastic as you \\nmove down the cabin how soft are the touch points so over here that feels pretty reasonable and then \\nthe door\\'s quite firm we\\'ve got our duromete r we\\'ve tested the main surfaces in this cabin if you want \\nto see how this car compares to other cars that we\\'ve tested before follow the link in the description oh \\nby the way um on the gerometer i was stopped in the street randomly the other day by bloke that \\nwatches our videos and um he said he loved the gerometer and thought it was quite a unique inclusion \\nso i\\'m glad someone enjoys that now what about builds quality actually all feels pretty decent it\\'s all \\nnice and solid in here um yeah pretty impresse d with that now moving on to infotainment um this is the \\nthing i find interesting about bmws if you look at all of the manufacturers out there bmw really is \\nstarting to push the game forward in terms of their infotainment systems i mean they already were b ut \\nthey\\'re really going that one step further and i don\\'t know i reckon these guys are probably second to \\ntesla now in terms of the tech inside these cars and how advanced it is so let\\'s start with the \\ninfotainment system it\\'s a 10.25 inch display uh high resolution screen it is touch sensitive so you can \\nuse your finger to switch between the different menus and then what you can also do is use the idrive \\ncontroller down here the top is also touch sensitive so if you are putting in navigation addresses for \\nexample you can write things in i find that a little hard to use at times but the option is there anyway \\nyou have inbuilt satellite navigation so this is uh standard to the car you don\\'t have to then pair a phone \\nto get your navigation running but if you d o want a pair of phone you have both apple carplay and \\nandroid auto apple carplay is wireless i\\'ll show you what that looks like we\\'ll click on this so you\\'ve got a \\nfull screen integration and if i go back here to the home menu you can see what that looks like so big \\nscreen very sharp and very quick to rip through those different menus there is one issue though uh just \\nlike other cars we\\'ve tested with apple carplay and a sort of idrive s controller you can\\'t tap to the side \\nlike this to to get across to th e other menus so if you see here i can\\'t then jump back over here i have to \\nreally just keep scrolling through so it\\'s a limitation of the software as opposed to the hardware so \\nhopefully apple will fix that with a future software update let\\'s have a look at what android auto looks \\nlike i\\'ll click on that so also full screen integration uh touchscreen and all that sort of stuff um you will \\nnotice here when you go to the main menu that you actually get the maps as a sub menu over to over to \\nthe left hand sid e so i quite like that setup really nice integration on the music front you have am fm and \\ndab digital radio you can also then uh stream through bluetooth and connect devices to the car directly \\nand you have a 10 -speaker stereo as well it\\'s worth pointing out here when i mentioned that these are \\nsort of becoming technologically advanced now i\\'ll jump down to the apps section so what you can do \\nwhen you buy the car you just get a standard set of apps with the car so these are the things that are on \\nthere at the moment if you do want to buy additional apps you can actually go into the the bmw \\nconnected drive store and then add things to the car so if you want to use remote engine start for \\nexample you can pay for that and have it added to the car as an over -the-air update you can then also \\ngo through the things that you have paid for so someone has already gone through on this particular car \\nand added things like teleservices uh and the connected drive package as well so yeah this is where i \\nwas going at with t he tesla thing so this is similar to the way tesla does things they allow you to do \\nupdates over there they give you that software while car\\'s parked at home bmw is now heading down \\nthe same path and i think this stuff\\'s really cool to see now one last thi ng i want to show you ahead of \\nthe driver is a 12 inch display i\\'ll show you how that works i\\'m going to turn the car on so you get a \\nwhole stack of different options here on the screen in terms of what you want displayed you can \\n\\nconfigure a lot of it as well so over on the left hand side you have your fuel as a digital readout with the \\nrange time then you also have engine temperature and external temperature here and with the drive \\nmodes you\\'ll notice as well when i switch between  the drive modes the display changes to \\naccommodate those different drive mode settings and then in the center you\\'ve got a map overlay this \\nsection here you can also change is required as well so pretty impressive setup and i like the fact that \\nthis comes  standard on the entry level model so let me kill that let\\'s chat safety equipment so you have \\nautonomous emergency braking you have an auto dimming rear vision mirror blind spot monitoring \\nwith a little light built into the wing mirror you have a lane dep arture warning and a lane keeping \\nassistant it is disappointing though you get standard cruise control but no radar cruise control you have \\nto option that which yeah i don\\'t know on a 70 000 car i would have liked to have radar cruise control i \\nreckon uh p arking you have front and rear parking sensors you can get a 360 camera as part of an \\noption package but uh it just comes standard with a rear view camera i\\'ll show you what that looks like \\ni\\'m just going to start the car first pop it into reverse uh there  it is there yeah quality is okay it\\'s not \\namazing it\\'s quite a sort of small display there as well i\\'m pretty sure you\\'d be able to configure it so you \\njust get the camera but you\\'ve also got those sonar settings there so you can see front and rear as wel l \\nand then this also has the park assist feature which has a reverse assistant as well if you want to see \\nhow that tech works click up here to watch a video we shot where we actually demonstrate this in \\nanother bmw it\\'s this this feature actually is pretty  cool so um have a look at that okay quick question \\num bmws e30 is one of my favorites let me know what your favorite three series is in the comments \\nsection below is it newer older um can you get your feedback moving on to practicality and we\\'ll start \\nwith connectivity where you\\'re gonna charge your stuff so you have one usb a port here a 12 volt outlet \\nyou have a wireless phone charger there for charging your phone inside the center console here you \\nhave another charging port but it\\'s a usb c port so you do have a mixture of both which is really good \\num storage where are you going to put your phone so yes you can throw it down the front there for \\nyour charging or you can slide it into these cup holders up the front coffee cup now the coffee cup this \\nmornin g i noticed when i put it in it kind of it\\'s just hard to get out while you\\'re driving because you\\'ve \\ngot to sort of watch what you\\'re doing reach in and it\\'s a little tricky to reach so i sort of propped it up \\nwith my keys but it does fit in there and it is secure because you\\'ve got a set of teeth in there as well \\nthat means when you are putting stuff like your bottle in it slides into position there which is nice and \\neasy and then it fits inside the door easily as well let\\'s see if our big bottle fits in the door no it doesn\\'t \\num center console so in here the storage is pretty good it\\'s not overly deep but it is a big storage cavity \\nand then over here we have our glove box now the thing with this is it looks okay but if you actually try \\nputting anything in  there when you go to close it it kind of jams everything up the back there so it\\'s not \\nthe most practical space in the world then finally you have a slot just over here next to the driver\\'s knee \\nfor coins and keys and that kind of thing okay now let\\'s tal k comfort so dual zone climate control up the \\nfront here you\\'ll also see this car has the heated seats as well i quite like with the dual zone they\\'ve got \\nit integrated into this nice little digital display here then you have these metallic controls for yo ur air \\nvents as well and then you adjust the temperature just off to the side here so nice little setup there in \\nterms of the driver\\'s seat and the passenger seat both of those are electric the driver\\'s seat has memory \\non it seats themselves are pretty com fortable you\\'ve got a number of adjustments you can make to \\nthem just to give you a little bit more comfort behind the wheel the wheel itself i love the m sport wheel \\nbecause it just fills the hands beautifully and it just feels i don\\'t know it feels reall y sporty to be driving \\nwith but it is also nice and comfortable to live with as well with easy access to those paddle shifters in \\nterms of the steering you can reach and tilt adjust that now let\\'s do a reach test yes easy to reach that\\'s \\nall easy to reach and then your adjustable controls down here are easy to reach as well okay second row \\nthis is where you\\'re going to see a little bit of compromise in comparison to an suv you can see here that \\nwith my seat in the standard driving position which is pretty f ar back i don\\'t really have a great deal of \\nknee room toe room is pretty compromised and then getting in and out i find how to get my shoes \\nthrough this little gap here um headroom is is okay they actually do a long wheelbase version of the \\nthree series th e a4 and the c -class just for china i\\'d like to see that offered elsewhere in the world what \\ndo you reckon do you think they should let me know down there i just think it needs just a tiny bit more \\nleg room and it would really accommodate us bigger austral ians in terms of other creature comforts you \\n\\nhave a third zone of climate control down here two usb -c ports air vents map pockets you have a center \\narmrest with two cupholders there you can see it fits our bottle nicely i\\'ll get that out of the way this is \\nalso a port into the boot so you can get you r stuff out if you need to in addition to the iso fix points on \\nthe outboard seats you have three top tether points it is curious though this center seat belt encroaches \\nso much on the space of your left hand side passenger i\\'d imagine that would be kind o f digging into \\nthem so yeah interesting placement there for the center seat belt let\\'s have a look at cargo space so \\nobviously this isn\\'t an suv i know we always review suvs but sedans are still pretty practical in terms of \\ncargo space you\\'ve got 480 litre s here to work with the only downside is the entry aperture to your boot \\nit\\'s a little bit tricky to get a hold of uh beneath the cargo floor we have a battery and then off to the \\nsides a first aid kit let\\'s try putting our bags in and see how that goes so  that top peg there i think this \\nshould fit long ways they got no dramas at all okay the other thing you can also do to expand that space \\na little bit is drop your second row you\\'ve got little releases just here once they\\'re pulled you can \\nmanually pop tho se seats down to expand the space okay we\\'ve just hit the road in the three series let\\'s \\nrun through the engine first so under the bonnet there is a two liter turbocharged four -cylinder petrol \\nengine it makes 135 kilowatts of power and 300 newton meters of  torque now it doesn\\'t sound like a \\ngreat deal but you\\'ve got to remember that this car doesn\\'t weigh all that much either and that means \\nthat you don\\'t need to cram a giant engine under the bonnet but when you do that\\'s how these things \\nbecome so fast so this is a really good balance between weight management and also having a \\nturbocharged full cylinder all that torque sent through an eight speed automatic transmission no dual \\nclutch here so it is just a regular torque converter and it\\'s all the better for  it as well because dual \\nclutches in these packages where they don\\'t really produce all that much power are simply there for \\nefficiency and you end up ruining your driving characteristics just for the sake of saving a little bit of fuel \\nthis really splits the balance there between a good driving experience and not using a great deal of fuel \\nto begin with on the fuel front the official fuel consumption figure is 6.3 liters per 100k quickly whipped \\nthrough our trip computer here we are currently sitting on 6. 7 so it\\'s pretty much bang on and that\\'s \\nwith a mix of city and highway driving so i\\'m really impressed with that keep in mind as well with the \\nfuel economy that this car requires 95 ron premium unleaded petrol in australia so you will be paying \\nslightly m ore every time you fill up at the pump how does it all feel behind the wheel so gearbox first \\nlet\\'s give this a little mash here yeah nice that is very nice and responsive so back when dual clutches \\nwere the only option if you wanted fast shifting and you know lightning fast responses that was great \\nbut now when you have advanced gearboxes like this one here where all you need to do is push the \\nthrottle down and there\\'s barely any lag it really does bridge that gap and means that you do have a \\nsmooth drivin g experience all the time one of the things i\\'m liking here is the stop start system so i\\'ll roll \\ninto a stop as it comes down towards zero it kicks off and then restarts nice and smoothly and quickly so \\nit\\'s not a mild hybrid system like you do find in th e new c -class or the updated c -class but it is quite \\nsmooth and that\\'s what i like about these stop start systems when they\\'re not smooth i just switch them \\noff and that makes them entirely redundant but this one is actually quite good so you slow to a sto p and \\nit just stops off the brake and then away you go yeah let\\'s talk drive mode so you have eco pro which \\nbasically just dulls all of your energy sapping devices uh you have comfort which is just your standard \\ndrive mode and then you have sport with spor t mode you can also configure individual settings so kind \\nof pointless in this car with you know non -adaptive suspension but you can configure steering tune and \\nthe way that the engine and transmission respond as well so that every time you push that butto n \\nyou\\'re getting your individual settings okay let\\'s talk about the thing i\\'m really really disliking about this \\ncar and it is the ride it is way way way too firm and the problem is that you get the sporty feel behind \\nthe wheel because you know as we\\'ll di scuss in a second the steering feels great but when you go over \\nthings like speed humps and potholes and corrugations you feel everything that\\'s going on and this is \\nthe point that i made in the intro that you have to get adaptive dampers this car doesn\\'t have adaptive \\ndamping and as a result of that it just feels way too firm and i just don\\'t know that that really works for \\nan entry -level car like this it just doesn\\'t make sense to have such firm suspension that it\\'s not enjoyable \\nto drive and that\\'s how i  feel at the moment it really just doesn\\'t feel pleasing unless you\\'re going for a \\nblat every time outside of that it\\'s just way too much okay let\\'s dial it into sport mode so i can \\nimmediately feel the steering\\'s a little heavier there roll into the throt tle here oh this feels so good \\n\\nthat\\'s what i love about the 3 series rear wheel drive you have such good communication through the \\nchassis and look it\\'s got enough power to put a smile on your face but it won\\'t sort of put you into any \\ndanger so the staggered tyre widths with 255 on the  rear mean that you really get a nice hook up with \\nthe road throttle\\'s nice and sharp in sport mode as well just kind of pushes you back and it\\'s just a smile \\ninducing car i know every time i\\'ve driven like a a c -class or an a4 they\\'re nice but in base lev el trim they \\nfeel very base level and very soft and cushy this on the other hand just has that engaging feel to it and if \\nyou put the suspension to one side i just feel like if you found yourself on a mountain pass this is the car \\nthat\\'s going to make you smile every single time in comparison to the competition now what about zero \\nto 100 we don\\'t have an official time from bmw but this is how it went up against our stopwatch on the \\nvisibility front we\\'re used to suvs sitting up high having that commanding d riving position this on the \\nother hand you sit quite low and it\\'s it\\'s that sporty feel so i can see clearly down the front of the car i\\'ve \\ngot a nice head up display there with all the information i need the wing mirrors aren\\'t huge but they \\ngive me good visibility down the side of the car visibility out the rear is good as well the envelope there \\nof the rear window is pretty decent so with front and rear parking sensors it means parking in and \\naround the city is a really straightforward process and then i f you\\'re not confident you can always \\noption that extra package which adds the 360 camera and the semi -autonomous parking let\\'s talk noise \\nso it\\'s not the most quiet place to be seated uh you\\'re getting a little bit of tire noise that comes into the \\ncabin it\\'s most evident out on country roads but for the most part it is quiet enough it\\'s just that is going \\nto be the predominant noise that you hear when you are cruising at highway speeds now not that \\nyou\\'re going to ever be doing this but just in case you d o need a tow there\\'s a 1600 kilogram break \\ntowing capacity and then when it comes to u -turns turning circle measures 11.4 meters which is pretty \\nstandard for a sedan okay bmw 3 series how much does it relate to that e30 that i like well still quite a \\nlot a ctually so it feels really nimble behind the wheel it\\'s got that rear wheel drive characteristic the \\nsteering is direct it is just the definition of a driver\\'s car it\\'s not soft like the c -class or the lexus is really is \\njust a nice all -rounder but it is u ltimately let down if you don\\'t get the adaptive suspension and in this \\ncase here the ride is just way too firm this is an entry -level car and yes it has to be fun but you can\\'t \\nhave a ride that is so firm that you just get sick of it immediately when you\\' re in the city so please make \\nsure you just spend a little bit extra for the adaptive damping if you have purchased one of these just \\nmake sure you tick that box before it gets delivered so if you put those things to the side it has lots of \\ntech it\\'s beaut iful inside it\\'s not a huge amount of leg room in the second row but for the most part it\\'s \\ngonna be fine for short journeys this is really the driver\\'s pick in this segment and it puts a big smile on \\nmy face even in this entry -level form so let me know in  the comments section below did you buy one \\nwhat do you think of it or did you go all the way up to like an m3 or something like that let me know \\nwhat you think down there if you did enjoy this video make

Model : 2023 BMW 320i  \\nReview:  \\n[Music] thank you [Music] good afternoon everyone welcome back to the YouTube channel and I just \\nwanted to now uh finally do a review of the BMW 3 Series 320i also known as the G20 oddly known as \\nthe G20 and I\\'ve had this car for two years now I\\'ve done 35  000 miles and I just wanted to provide my \\nfeedback and review of this car and to save you having to watch the rest of this video I\\'ll just cut to the \\nChase and say that this car is 100 crap it\\'s the worst car I\\'ve ever driven or leased and yeah it does \\nnothing well so watch no further but if you\\'re one of those curious types then I\\'ll continue with a more \\ndetailed explanation of why and how I came to that conclusion so I lease this car the 320i um because I \\nwas desperate for a car and at that time I don\\'t know if you guys remember but there was a shortage of \\nstock and I really need my family car broke down I needed a car for the school runs so I decided to \\nbased on really good reviews especially one by Mr Matt Watson who um nominated this car as the car \\nof the year um so I thought oh Matt Watson nominated Car of the Year it\\'s there in stock it was the \\nprice was right I thought okay fine the 420 pounds a month I got this car fully maintained uh for two \\n\\nyears um in 2021 um so that\\'s the story and um so I got so I got the car and I pretty much hated it from \\nthe from day one and I\\'ll tell you why firstly I didn\\'t like the drive I thought it was really really uh rough \\nand not very enjoyable at all um so from  that point of view I think um it just did not do it for me from a \\ncomfort perspective from a performance perspective because it\\'s a two liter engine and I felt that it \\ndidn\\'t give me the power as well um and um so I thought I\\'m not getting the Comfort I\\'m  not getting the \\npower what am I really getting then I thought maybe it\\'s practicality but if you think but if you look at \\num the rear seats and pardon the mess but um this really isn\\'t a lot of leg room in here I mean like you \\nknow you don\\'t really want t o spend I\\'m not you know uh very tall but you don\\'t really want to spend \\nmuch time in here at all um it\\'s quite claustrophobic actually so I think because of this low swooping \\npillar line um you know to give it a nicer shape um they scooped down quite a lo t but that does \\ncompromise on the Headroom so there\\'s that problem um then the other thing um I don\\'t like about \\nthe car is just generally I mean from a look and feel point of view when you get inside the car you just \\ndon\\'t feel like it\\'s made of any reall y good materials at all what I do like about the car I suppose the \\nlights and the front look I think it does look nice from certain angles [Applause] um so I do like the front \\nlight design and I think that\\'s what attracted me to the car if you look at the rear of the car it\\'s also um \\nquite a good design so I did like the lighting and the design compared to the other BMWs that were that \\nare being made which have some really hideous uh BMW lighting design so I thought this was more \\nTimeless but look for some reason and I kid you not for two years this flies come and sit on this car now \\nyou look on the Jag no flies what do you say about flies being attracted to what I didn\\'t say it but look \\nI\\'m not making this up so yeah there\\'s that um now from a boot perspect ive I\\'ll show you it\\'s quite quite \\na deep boot and those seats do fold down and you can have a bit more space but generally whenever \\npeople get in the back leg room is very very limited in this car for the size of the car and it\\'s quite a big \\nthing we\\'ve p ut on a lot of weight but I don\\'t know where it\\'s gone because it\\'s not translated into more \\ncabin space coming inside the car which is the biggest issues that I have with this car apart from the way \\nthat it drives is um the AC issue um and then also um I don\\'t know how this car has been designed but \\nnotice this on any G20 which is this shape of BMW 3 Series notice this that whenever the whole car is \\nclean for some reason this area will be the filthiest will get dirtiest the first which results in two \\nprobl ems number one every time you have to open the boot or close it with your hands at least you \\nhave to touch it and you end up touching the most dirtiest part of the car so it comes up on in your \\nhands that\\'s really really annoying especially in the winters and that even if you take it to a car wash \\nwithin two three days this area will be filthy and then you\\'ll you won\\'t want to touch it every time you \\nneed to close your boot and it\\'s not electrically operated boot so that\\'s really annoying the other \\nproblem that this creates which people don\\'t talk about is that you\\'ll see that the rear parking camera is \\nmounted here right and it kind of protrudes out a little bit so what happens is all that crap for some \\nreason the way the car is designed the way the car is designed and all the crap that comes up it goes in \\nright on the lens which means that this camera looks like well this camera then just becomes very very \\ndirty and you can\\'t see anything out of it it\\'s just amazing how quickly this camera then gets dirty a nd \\nyou can\\'t see anything and you have to manually go out and wipe the lens before you you can use your \\nreverse camera again getting performance I have good handling the other thing I don\\'t know if you can \\nmake out is is this that when you\\'re sitting in th e car this pillar that comes down it really does come \\ndown over your head which does make you feel cooped in and it\\'s just not a nice place to be the minute \\nyou pull up you want to get out of the car it\\'s just because it it it it just is not good feng shui  or it doesn\\'t \\nfeel good to me anyway so that\\'s another thing I don\\'t like about this car um also um you know the car \\njust you know it\\'s hard to say but apart from the steering wheel which is okay um and this gear stick \\nwhich leaves always uh smart you kno w hand prints on it because it\\'s that glossy glossy stuff it does feel \\nokay but it doesn\\'t feel premium like even if you look at the seats and the leather this faux leather it just \\ndoesn\\'t feel uh very nice in here at all so it does it does feel a bit basi c I suppose it is a 320i but still um \\nyeah it just feels a bit outdated really you\\'d expect more from a car in 2021 another problem with this \\ncar is I can press this button right which says Max AC and everything pretty much goes ballistic and the \\nAC starts  to work right but inadvertently if you ever hit that with well there you go and if you ever hit \\nthat with um by accident then um it will come on now if I switch it off you\\'ll see that the AC Still Remains \\non so now how do I switch the AC off there\\'s no di rect off and on for the AC so you have to go into the \\n\\nmenu of the AC and then you have to go over here and then you have to untick this and now you\\'ll see \\nthat the AC is no longer on but if I hit that by accident again and I\\'m say over here or somewhere else in \\nyou know I have to now to switch that off I can\\' t just do that the AC stays on really really annoying sorry \\nbefore we set off I just wanted to have a rant about this really BMW really you\\'re going to give us \\nmanual seats in 2021 when we had this technology 35 years ago what next do I have to pay extra f or \\nheadlights because 100 years ago cars didn\\'t all have headlights I mean like really why can we not just \\nhave electric seats for all cars in 2021 especially from so -called premium brand like BMW ran over let\\'s \\ngo for a drive then and see um what it drive s like and I\\'ll share some thoughts while driving this car um \\nyeah I find that um the infotainment system this touchscreen thing is just a gimmick it doesn\\'t really \\nwork I feel like the iDrive infotainment system overall over the last four or five years ha s just gone a bit \\nbackwards because it hasn\\'t really progressed as well and they\\'ve tucked in a lot of functionality into um \\nthe actual infotainment system like set embedded in the infotainment system and not enough one \\ntouch control and I think that as we  get into digital infotainment systems with electric cars especially \\nsecond operation should always be one touch available on the the dash or on the control panel of the \\ncar that should never be embedded in a digital menu system like BMW have done with wit h their AC so I \\nthink there needs to be a rethink by car manufacturers about which one touch controls they must retain \\non the control panel rather than making customers go into menus and then selecting those controlled \\nembedded within menus and submenus th at\\'s not gonna work and AC on and off should be one touch \\non the dash as should um key other things that I\\'m sure you can think of The Usual Suspects we don\\'t \\nreally want to see that kind of stuff disappearing and shriveling down and turning it into the di gital \\nmenu system even if it\\'s on a screen I still want to see one touch operation for certain things um I don\\'t \\nknow if you guys feel about that but yeah let\\'s take this car for a drive and then and let\\'s collect some \\nthoughts there when you put this car into Comfort mode it goes into Comfort mode but it\\'s just mocking \\nyou when you\\'re driving along um even when the car is in Comfort mode um it\\'s really not very \\ncomfortable at all as you can see by how much of the camera is shaking that uh you know it reall y this is \\nnot comfortable at all so I\\'m not going particularly fast but I feel really as a driver you do feel kind of \\nviolated when you\\'re driving along in this 320i um just because of I mean I you know I always joke about \\nit if you want to digest your foo d have a meal and then go for a drive in this car and yep by the end of \\nthe journey you will have burped and a few times like the way you do a a newborn baby and uh you at \\nleast it helps you digest your food perhaps that\\'s one of the many Fantastic feature s of the of this \\nfantastic BMW 320i okay so driving characteristics wise um I think I suppose if I was going down the \\nNurburgring then I\\'d really like this car as a saloon it\\'s very tight torque taught poised and cornering very \\nprecise the way it just catc hes a corner or distribute it distributes its uh its weight so from that \\nperspective it\\'s uh very very good uh uh it really does change direction exceptionally well uh but it\\'s just \\nthe experience of of driving it that makes it very very lame um I guess pr oblem with this car is you see \\neven when you give it the beans it just kind of TAPS out it just it just Taps out like Conor McGregor \\nagainst Habib and there\\'s nothing really there and you\\'re just left with this sense of want and need and \\nuh it just takes a  little bit too long to change gears I think possibly or it\\'s just because it\\'s just a four -part \\nengine and you know it has its limitations so the overall experience of putting your foot down in this car \\nis very underwhelming just kind of whistles like a l ittle um electric shaver and and then just Taps up as I \\npull into my neighborhood in the last few times with this car after two years of leasing it I must say you \\nwon\\'t be missed so in conclusion um the brmw 320i G20 model for me is a bit of a flop it\\'s no where near \\nits predecessors and it lets its ancestry down the E30 was a great car it was lots of fun to drive it had \\nplenty of power through all of the model variants and it was a great Driving Experience this car if I was \\nto say something positive about i t is that\\'s really well engineered and I\\'m sure you\\'ve heard this about \\nBMWs before great engineering great handling great weight distribution but in the olden days or not so \\nolden days it was also about The Ultimate Driving Experience and that\\'s the thing  that\\'s missing with this \\nBMW model variant it\\'s the Driving Experience it\\'s very very underwhelming it\\'s very uncomfortable it\\'s \\nill-equipped and they\\'re not very powerful and not very economical not very practical doesn\\'t do \\nanything well it\\'s the Jack o f all trades but master of none although hasn\\'t even jacked Comfort properly \\nI don\\'t know why they\\'ve got a comfort mode setting in there because it doesn\\'t work it\\'s not possible \\nand I\\'m not on run flat tires by the way these aren\\'t tires non -run flat nor mal air tires and the car is \\n\\ndamn uncomfortable um so I really will be glad to see the back of it and um the Audi e -tron is a much \\nbetter car it\\'s competitor the C -Class is a much better car because it\\'s a lot more comfortable and it\\'s \\nbetter equipped for the same money um so I just t hink I hope that the next model variant they bring \\nmore of the Driving Experience back into the three series because this car\\'s left me after two years \\nunable to love it I\\'ve I\\'ve kind of fallen out of love with the three series after having this for two t wo \\nyears and it\\'s gonna be hard to win me back so those are my thoughts after two years and 35 000 miles \\nlet me know what you guys think and whether or not you agree disagree and if you think I\\'ve been too \\nharsh on the car thanks a lot for watching and I\\'l l see you guys again foreign [Music]  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW 320i  \\nReview:  \\nnow in its seventh generation the bmw 3 series is a car fan favorite updated in 2019 it\\'s now 55 kg \\nlighter and much more aggressive if you\\'re thinking about getting one keep watching this is the bmw 3 \\nseries arguably it is the king of the executive car cl ass especially this lou business people love it families \\nlove it and there\\'s boy races on the slide it\\'s got some stiff competition in its class it\\'s got a c -class it\\'s \\ngot the audi a4 but does the three series have the edge let\\'s take a look currently the re\\'s four trim levels \\navailable in the three series this one is the m sport spec which is one up from entry level it gives the car \\na sporty body kit and upgraded alloys it\\'s coming so now that i\\'m in the car what do i think the interior is \\ntypical bmw it\\'s  very minimalist but classy and everything feels very well put together and premium and \\nsport spec gives you this sport steering wheel and 320 engines and bigger give you automatic sports \\ntransmission and gear shift paddles the touchscreen is really easy t o use it\\'s very responsive you also get \\nsome physical buttons and you get this selector which is good you get a choice all trim levels come with \\napple carplay android auto and sat nav you also get front and rear parking sensors and reversing camera \\nas stan dard while there\\'s not much going on in here it is still very well thought out and very practical \\nand comfortable lots of place to store your stuff well i\\'m comfortable in here but what i will say is it \\nneeds an electric seat like to have one of these payi ng nearly 40 grand for a car it definitely needs \\nelectrically adjustable seats which you can upgrade to but you shouldn\\'t have to that should be like a \\ngiven now so bmw if you\\'re listening we need electric seats come on standard with m sport you\\'re going \\nto get the heated leather seats the sport seats se pro which is the entry -level trim just comes with cloth \\nseats and they\\'re not heated it\\'s about 900 pounds to upgrade why don\\'t you quit they\\'re free in the air \\nfor so what\\'s it like in the back well i have  to say i\\'m feeling pretty comfortable here the 3 series does \\nhave more leg room than the audi a4 similar headspace however it is overall roomier than its other \\ncompetitor the mercedes c -class it\\'s really practical with lots of clever space to put your kid s strengths \\nand other bits for those long journeys speaking of practicality let\\'s check out the boot sadly no power \\ntailgate so we\\'re gonna have to do it the normal way with the seeks up you get 480 liters of boot space \\nwhich is 25 liters more than the mer cedes c -class and the same as the audi a4 price and size wise the 3 \\nseries is definitely more on par with the audi a4 but what\\'s it like to drive so this particular model is the \\n320i m sport so it does have a safer suspension they\\'d stiffen the suspension anywhere i feel like the \\nprincess and the p in this car because i can feel every lump and bump in the road and for those that \\ndon\\'t know if you can\\'t tell from my accent i live in yorkshire so there\\'s plenty of lumps and bumps in \\nthese roads i think that o ut of its contenders this car drives the best it\\'s probably the most fun as well \\nlet\\'s just see what this could do uphill and when you start to put your foot down you can feel it\\'s like \\nokay then jekyll and hyde mode get the foot down a little bit oh yeah it\\'s definitely a lot of fun to drive \\ni\\'d definitely be going for the 320 engine or higher i think the 318 probably won\\'t be as fun so overall \\nwhat do i think to the 3 series i\\'m actually quite impressed i think it\\'s really handsome i love the way \\nthat it looks however the suspension is something that i cannot get on with and neither can my back i \\nwould definitely opt for either the optional extra which is the adaptive suspension or i would upgrade to \\nm sport pro which is probably my special choice anyway i f you\\'re gonna be doing a lot of motorway \\nmiles the 328 or 330 d engine is a lot more economical than the petrol but they\\'ve also got hybrid \\nvariants too that are economical depends on what works for you so what do you think to the bmw 3 \\nseries jupiter fer ris rivals oh are you a bit more of a bmw person let me know in the comments enjoyed \\n\\nthis video make sure that you like the

: 2023 BMW 320i  \\nReview:  \\nhey what\\'s up guys said here and today i am in the 2020 bmw 320i g20 so this is the latest three series \\nthat you can get in the market and this is the 320i sport not m sport okay this is just a sport version i \\ndrove the julia recently and then um you know this was a car that i really wanted to compare it with \\nbecause the 3 series has always been known to be very dynamic in terms of driving and all that so yeah \\nlet\\'s compare these three series and julia because to be very honest the julia is uh in this segme nt right i \\nmean i drove the a4 3 series the f -30 and the e -90 and the c -class uh and the jaguar the julia is by far the \\nsharpest so i wanted to yeah i really wanted to get behind the wheels of this car and then we can do a \\ncomparison more or less so uh mic hael the first question is you know why did you choose the bmw 3 \\nseries so i was looking at a couple of cars in the similar segment which is a luxury compact sedan so i \\nwas looking at cl8 the new one the c180 the w205c class i was also looking at the audi a4 is the e9 okay \\num but what struck me the most about this car scorpio looks like okay it\\'s it looks as subjective but i \\nthink just the different headlights the shape the shape overall you know yeah uh quite different from \\nthe f30 yes yeah it\\'s more of li ke a evolution rather than a refam version of the same car so yeah that\\'s \\nwhat i like about it and also the size i\\'m quite tall yeah by the way the owner is about 1.98 meters tall \\nright almost two meters so uh you couldn\\'t fit in the seal i i could fit in the cla in the driver\\'s seat but \\nwhoever is sitting behind me ah the problem not to suffer is really problematic similar uh similar thing \\nfor the sea class also okay because of the roof line was quite difficult because i when i tried it out like \\nmy parents  or my parents were there with me also okay then you were like really khan can\\'t go in the \\nback so this was the only was this the only car that you know was comfortable for everyone oh i actually \\ndidn\\'t get to try the audi um but when i first stepped into this car i mean just the interior the size \\neverything uh really because i was looking at decent c -class because then this was just amazing a clear \\nchoice i was looking around also but looks wise size wise everything got to test drive it also okay so this \\nwas a stand -out one this was a send out okay for my needs we\\'ve won this car for about a year a year \\nyeah okay so how\\'s your i mean it\\'s not very long also but how\\'s your experience so far uh good um no \\nissues no issues yeah uh one thing i think is the sun roof otherwise sometimes the sun will cover okay \\nsometimes the close heart closes halfway or doesn\\'t fully close it\\'s automatic right it\\'s automatic i mean \\ni\\'m guessing it works fine but sometimes just stop off with it yeah something just stops away or you  will \\ngo here and then it will come back up oh i think like a sensor issue yeah but actually uh what i do is what \\ni did is just reset the sunroof by like holding this button for about 10 seconds yeah and it works already \\nso just once in a while do that it\\' s not a big thing with it okay okay other than that everything else has \\nbeen everything else up to your expectations what about fuel consumption for this car okay so do you \\ndrive like fast or how\\'s your driving style oh you know sometimes sometimes young g uys like to try yeah \\nokay got it sometimes a little bit of spirited driving at 10.8 liters per 100 so that\\'s slightly under 10 \\nkilometers per liter yeah okay so actually that\\'s not super good or anything large but it depends on the \\nway i drive as well beca use the tank on this guy is 59 liters right yeah 59 meters okay actually if i drive \\nreally [Music] oh that\\'s not too bad yeah i have to do the math but okay and run like yeah okay okay \\nnext like what do you like about your 3 series as i said before looks i  think looks is very important for me \\n\\nfor cars first thing first the looks i think it looks very fierce [Music] and this is not even the m spot \\nversion this is the spot trim right correct but even so i think it still looks very fierce looks very menacing \\nfrom the front secondly the size you me ntioned that that factored into the buying decision i think it\\'s \\nlike a baby 5 series i\\'ve never driven the 5 series before the g3 yeah the g30 it looks yeah it looks like a \\nbaby five series yeah but the driving feel here i can tell you right now it\\'s very  different it\\'s very very \\ndifferent yeah yeah uh what i like about it also is the handling you can take corners very well i mean it\\'s \\nheavy give it downpour now but sometimes around the corner so i can get a lot of confidence also the \\nexhaust note yeah the  stock exhaust smart exhaust police stop okay sometimes you put into sport plus \\nyou rev it 4k rpm oh yeah yeah yeah yeah [Music] what do you dislike about your 3 series nothing i \\nmean really nothing man but if i have to nitpick when i first got the car i h ave to get used to all the \\nmodes okay like getting into neutral from driver from reverse you\\'ve got to be quite gentle with it uh in \\nterms of um when i first call it sometimes when i\\'m in reverse i went about one push to the next gear \\nright you don\\'t reall y have to shift through that yes exactly exactly yeah okay okay but i i got used to it \\nwithin the first weekend you just have to be quite gentle with it so just uh my overall i mean like first \\nimpressions this drives very differently from a 5 series g30 be cause the 5 series g30 is like the steering is \\nsuper light like super duper light like you can turn it with one finger [Music] it\\'s really very very light and \\nthen it\\'s also very comfortable yeah i\\'m not saying this is not comfortable this is a little comf ortable but \\njust sitting inside yeah it feels like a totally different car i think because the steering is a bit heavier a \\nway on to the heavier side not as light as an audi a4 or a mercedes c -class so yeah well but the engine \\nresponsiveness is for just a small 2 -liter 180 horsepower car yeah the engine is very responsive okay \\nslide the whole leg but you know from a two liter engine single turbo uh it\\'s quite expected this car the \\nsuspension doesn\\'t work the bottom like there\\'s no bounce yes in in the suspe nsion like it just in a way \\nlike sticks to the road yes yeah yeah that\\'s why i meant when i say something i can take corners the car \\nmakes it like that like so in a way i can say this is a bit more planted than a four series because the four \\nseries is quit e floaty it does it\\'s like very comfortable you know which four series uh they\\'re a green \\ncoupe you can really feel the steering like get heavier immediately yes i mean also a bit jerky though at \\nthis principle yeah yeah you can really feel the engine work ing hard yeah and i don\\'t know if it\\'s placebo \\nbut um it\\'s more pleasant if the brake bites the biting point is earlier [Music] is this sharper than julia \\nunfortunately no the way the car just um you know like julia is like it pivots instead of turns yeah it\\'s like \\nsomething you just have to experience then you understand it\\'s by the way if you guys are um you know \\nconsidering between a julia and a 3d series or you\\'re wondering which one is sharper julia is sharper but \\nthis is also very good but julia is ju st the sensation it\\'s just different you know it\\'s like eating at \\nmcdonald\\'s you get a big mac or you get a mac spicy both are very nice very good yeah just that the \\nsensation is different now yeah it\\'s like that but uh i have some guys in my cargo chat wi ll have three toy \\napis for sale the g20 yeah the j20 320i is about a year old okay uh one year one year one okay i think \\naround one seven pieces 170 180 something oh yeah speaking of that you got this car last year during \\ncircuit breaker right yes do you m ind sharing like uh how much you paid for it because i remember that \\nperiod cars were like laylong prices yeah my coe in and of itself was only 36k 36k yeah okay you \\ncompare it to prices now now it\\'s like 60 something six or something yeah okay and uh what  was the \\noverall car price 186 186 okay and this is a pi version [Music]  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW 320i  \\nReview:  \\nhi guys so today i\\'m at the bmw group malaysia headquarters in cyberjaya it\\'s my e39 over there and \\nright next to it is the car that we are picking up today this is the g20 320i sport [Music] [Applause] \\n[Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] okay guys so th is is the latest addition to the three series family in \\nmalaysia this is the 320i sport priced at about 240 000 ringgit okay so it\\'s a good 40 000 ringgit cheaper \\nthan the existing 330i and for that savings what do you uh what what what what do you drop ou t from \\nthe 330i right so firstly you make do with less power it\\'s the same two liter turbo engine under the hood \\nas the 330i but tuned to lower outputs the 330i makes about 252 horsepower this is 190 horsepower so \\nit\\'s a substantial reduction there okay um  and also you can see that the appearance of the car is \\n\\ndifferent the 320i does not have m sport kit um but i think personally i think this this non -m sport \\nwheels uh the design is more attractive looking than the ones they expect for the 330i now the \\ndiameter of the rims are identical to the 330i 18 inches but  the difference besides the design is that the \\n330i being an ms uh being fitted with m sport package has the front and rear views in staggered sizing \\nthe 320i here front rear wheels are the same width so you can see here these these uh these tires two \\nto five forty five r18 at the front and it is the same size at the back okay uh this this this navy blue color \\nuh combo i think it looks really nice on the car it\\'s uh it\\'s uh it it\\'s uh it\\'s a it complements the lines of \\nthis car well now let me just show you  from this angle uh the 320i and the 330i in malaysia they share \\nthe same headlight designs this this is the uh it\\'s a it\\'s a it\\'s a pretty high spec headlight okay it\\'s not the \\nhighest spec headlight in the lineup but it\\'s still led headlamps led headlamp s because you see the the \\nheadlight design that you typically see in the uh overseas press materials the one where the the daytime \\nrunning light actually goes upwards right uh those are laser head lamps and they cost a lot more this is \\nthe next step down f rom laser head lamps still pretty high spec leds um of course i said this when i \\nreviewed the 330i i think what bmw could have done is that they could have give given these headlights \\nuh a bit more of an expressive design because right now right when you w hen you switch the car on \\nwhen you drive it the daytime running lights just this this this lines here uh looks a bit underwhelming \\nnow this kink here this is an homage to the e46 okay where where the the lower edge of the taillight \\nalso is uh has this kink  okay but this one is a lot sharper it\\'s almost like uh like the sharp you know the \\nthe shark fin that hey you know that that that\\'s maybe an indirect tribute to another uh bmw old bmw \\nuh design queue you know the old sharknose bmws maybe that\\'s a sort of like an indirect tribute now \\num you can see the the the low the bumper here uh compared to the m spot bumper you can see a lot \\nmore painted surface okay this this is the led uh front fog lamps and it\\'s encased within this t -shaped uh \\nsurround okay trim sur round overall is a very simple very understated uh front bumper design now let \\nme just bring you to the back now here you can see here the side there\\'s this sort of like artificial \\nextension to the window line okay to to accentuate the hofmeister king effe ct but personally when you \\nuh you ask me when you look at it from the inside here the natural shape of the door it\\'s already you \\nknow has a very pronounced hofmeister king effect so i i i do not fully understand uh why why they had \\nto do this to to to you know to further um enlarge the the the glass area okay so at the back here the \\nyou can see the uh the lower edge of the bumper there\\'s this gloss black trim element here okay and \\nyou have the exhaust pipe either side okay one two okay this used to be an ex clusive design cue only for \\nthe six cylinder model upwards with the f30 right if you see tailpipes like this it\\'s either the active hybrid \\n3 or the 335i the 3 liter 6 cylinder models but now this one 320i 330 upwards all have this one uh one \\nexhaust on eit her side and you can see here the the rear reflectors also encased within this shade the \\nsame uh t -shaped uh surround trim okay um 320i wood badging here sitting just above the uh the tail \\nlight before this prior to this with the f30 e90 generation this ba tch always sits uh inside of the taillight \\nnow with the uh g20 g30 generation they they are okay perfectly okay with the batch sitting just above \\nthe taillights so you get a reverse camera here good okay let\\'s open the boot nice boot right 40 20 40 \\nsplit f olding inside here got further hidden compartments under here there\\'s a 12 volt socket okay uh \\nhidden away from view and here also another compartment here with uh the this is the uh first aid kit \\nand down here open this is the toolkit all right so they no  longer put the tool kit here like they did in in \\nthis car all right so manual closing now before i show you the inside of the car let me just tell you that \\nthere are many ways you can lock and unlock uh the three series and and also bmws today in general so \\nfirstly you can program your phone to be something like a virtual uh key to the car but that requires \\nintervention from the dealer downloading apps into your phone and i\\'m not gonna go through that with \\nyou today so uh this is the regular key four okay this is the regular key for uh this car does not come \\nwith the with the uh that the fancy screen all right the fancy remote with the screen that we saw it with \\nthe g30 so you have this uh standard key fob and the best part is this check this out so as i wa lk okay i\\'m \\nnot pressing her as i walk pay attention the car unlocks itself so it you i mean you can deactivate this \\nfeature if you don\\'t want it but it\\'s there so this is bmw comfort access 2.0 it detects you approach the \\ncar and it unlocks itself as you as you approach now uh as you as you move away from the car see the \\nside mirrors full it has unlocked itself i think i\\'ve demonstrated this during the uh during the x540e \\npreview so here is it again in available in the 320 i own oh check it out that\\'s a to yota 86 relatives by \\n\\nmarriage all right so this is one thing now the other thing okay the other way to lock and unlock this car \\nis this little key card so this is just a simple nfc card so uh it doesn\\'t it\\'s uh what you do is on the driver \\ndoor there is an nfc reader okay let me just show you all right so unlock the car now then you get inside \\nso you drop this key into the nf into the wireless charger here and start the engine as per normal \\nbrilliant right so there are there are several ways you can you can uh get in and out an d start this car \\nand deactivate this car so you have the traditional traditional uh keyless entry all right which you use it \\nlike you\\'re all your normal keyless entries or this this card personally i think this is very useful because \\nuh say for example you \\'re a lady going to fine dining you carry one of those small little purses this fits \\nnicely into your wallet or say you\\'re going for like even me as a man uh i go play my futsal play my \\nbadminton this slots nicely inside my wallet so i have one less bulky item to carry around okay uh which \\ni think i think this is this is this is great okay or or even better program it to your phone thoros one item \\nless to carry right brilliant so now let\\'s get inside the car and check out the interior because uh it\\'s also \\ndamn hot now so i\\'m gonna start the car again um compared to so is the first thing you notice uh \\ncompared to the 330i it doesn\\'t have that fancy uh instrument cluster all right that doesn\\'t have that it \\nis this is a more traditional looking uh analog dial a ll right it\\'s it\\'s backlit so when you\\'re off the engine \\nuh this th this is a whole black panel but inside there you can see this is a physical dial these are all \\nphysical dust but just cowered in the panel and with all the displays of put on the surface s o it it has a \\nsort of like a virtual instrument cluster look but this is a far more conventional uh it is a conventional \\ninstrument cluster behind the only uh screen area actually is here okay uh all right so you can you okay \\nso here\\'s the bc button now th is this kind of interface is a bit more familiar coming from that old school \\ncar over there okay um right so you can you can see here this is the uh the the cruise control uh system \\nnow this particular unit i\\'m driving here this does not have active cruise  control it does not have auto \\nbraking but for 2020 bmw malaysia they have upgraded the g23 series and a few of their other models \\nas well to include auto braking so those of you guys who have been complaining on the comment \\nsections uh in forums on facebo ok that bmw has not been taking care of safety features well they have \\nhurt you and from 2020 onwards the g23 series and a few other bmw models they have they now come \\nwith auto braking as standard okay so um yeah so here you can see this is the this is th e button to in to \\ninterface with the with the uh digital display there all right so there\\'s this scrolling knob here nice \\nbecause you got a nice uh those nice patterns on the surface the um tactile feel of it is good all right but \\nuh and overall i would sa y that if you compare this cabin uh now this this definitely in terms of the build \\nmaterials the qualities um you can see that this is a spec down interior compared to what\\'s available \\nright at the top so you one eye you can see that you know somehow this cabin does not come with the \\nbest of what the three series have to offer and let me just point out why so example this panel you \\nknow that some uh somewhere out there somebody who paid more money this is probably in a nice uh \\nbrush metal kind of finish sam e with that speaker uh plastic speaker panel there okay uh in and you can \\nsee that this i drive screen here the real estate occupied by this screen is smaller it\\'s only a portion of \\nthis whole whole piece so um and and uh and and you can see the steering w heel here also uh it\\'s a bit \\nmore bare looking compared to what we had in the in the 330i uh and yeah some and also here you see \\nthe the door card the door card also it\\'s just one c of of of gray although the the the materials used are \\nof different texture s you know from top to bottom but i feel that they could have they could have given \\nit a you know so like a combination of contrast colors to layer the design to bring out the contours of \\nthe design now one thing that i have to comment is the lock and unlo ck button so they put it here for \\nthe driver that\\'s fine what\\'s not fine is they don\\'t have that one over there in older bmws like my e39 \\nthe lock and unlock button is placed in the middle somewhere along here so uh let\\'s say like when you \\ngo out and tap o ut food when i go and tap out food my wife was sitting down here she can unlock the \\ncar from her passenger seat but now now in in my case if i were to go there and tap out food my wife \\nwho\\'s sitting here she would have to stretch and reach for this button okay uh quite obviously uh this \\nbutton is a cost option in other markets and uh it\\'s it\\'s sad that it\\'s it\\'s unfortunate that this is specked \\nout uh i think i think what bmw really should do is to either spec but the buttons both side extended or \\nrelocate the button to the middle in any case there\\'s the real estate here for that anyways okay um \\nyeah so now now that we are here at least you can see that you have this pleasant uh metal finish here \\non this and it has a surface texture so it\\'s nice to touch and  you pop this okay there\\'s a soft uh soft \\n\\nopening okay excuse my e39 key and here you can see there\\'s a usb port here 12 volt socket this is the \\nwireless charging tray it\\'s rubberized the surface is rubberized so uh so if i dump my phone here it \\ndoesn\\'t move about and it automatically charges so h ere this this this is the cur the latest generation \\nbmw i drive slash gear selector panel um so engine start stop button here you can see this button one \\ntouch you can immediately select sport comfort or eco pro all right this is the i drive i drive uh pan el this \\nsection is the idrive panel so good tactile feel all right the rotary control knob bmw really has perfected \\nthis and now as you can see right um as you as you look at the the screen on display you you really see \\nhow they shrink it this this space h ere this space here to me this feels glaring do they have touch yes \\nthey have their enable touch that\\'s good so obviously i wouldn\\'t count on gesture control being here \\nyeah but but this this tile this tile uh interface is nice okay certainly no complaints  it all works well and \\nwhat else so you can see here this is the center console box usbc port there this is lit this is the lighting \\nand uh curious to know why is this step here i don\\'t i don\\'t fully understand why but it\\'s there okay uh \\nand yeah so let\\'s go to the back now come to the back seat full okay this this is amazingly spacious for a \\nthree series this is brilliant okay enough more than enough space for me to cross my legs uh you\\'ve got \\nrear single zoom climate control two usbc ports and a 12 volt s ocket here aircon vents let me just check \\nout the uh rear armrest this is the standard bmw template armrest and the uh the rear middle \\npassenger has a has a two buckle it\\'s a two buckle seat belt but i can\\'t find okay so this is the the uh the \\nthe secondar y buckle for the middle passenger all right and and so you have here isofix mounts okay so \\nthis is a uh this this flap lifts up it\\'s hinged here so you don\\'t have to to pull it out and don\\'t and look for \\nspace to to slot this now where is the release latch  for the 60 40 split folding i\\'ll explore that later okay \\nso you\\'ve got three individual adjustable headrests here and [Music] yeah and and and i must say these \\nthis this is this is fantastic accommodations here at the back all right so i\\'ve got good head room uh \\ngood lean angle fantastic tight support i think this is the best real accommodations i\\'ve ever seen in any \\ngeneration of the three series lovely place to be here i mean it\\'s not it\\'s not a seven series kind of \\nplushness but it\\'s a very very comfort able place to be in right very spacious nice now i\\'m just going to \\ncome open the boot again and yeah so i\\'m going to unlock this just drop the seats nice so you can see \\nhere uh lovely okay uh this is so you see here the boot it rises up here okay the the f loorboard rises up \\nto meet the seat back so that it creates a seamless floor okay right all right so here you have it this is the \\nuh walk around interior walk around full interior and exterior walk around off the 320i we\\'re going out \\nfor a drive but before  we go for a drive i\\'m just going to show you here the the lightning signature a bit \\nunderwhelming right they should have had this they should have made design this led headlamp to \\nresemble the laser lights uh lighting signature a bit more closely in my op inion okay so uh time to go for \\na drive now the thing about the 320i that uh that immediately you notice especially after you jump from \\nthe 330i is that this is nowhere near as fast i\\'m not saying it\\'s slow but uh if you compare to the way the \\n330i bolts o ff the line uh this the 320i here actually seems almost pedestrian by comparison it it is the \\nacceleration that it delivers uh it\\'s it\\'s it it comes in more in a more measured fashion okay uh it it \\ndoesn\\'t snap your neck as much as the 330i but make no mis take this thing is still properly fast and you \\nknow in any context 190 horsepower for a car this size is not what we would consider slow at all okay \\num certainly i mean if you have especially if you are coming from an e9320i with the lethargic two liter \\n150 horsepower engine this is easily a three or four step up upgrade so what you have here is that in \\nterms of performance the 320i is not blistering like the 330i but it offers more than adequate \\nperformance all right it it gives you more than enough punch to sprint from traffic light to traffic light \\nand what i like about it is is that the overall acceleration it\\'s is its smoothness the power the whole \\npower train uh and transmission combination is just very very smoothly executed and you still can pull it \\nto the red line with a fair degree of enthusiasm okay it\\'s just not explosive like uh like it was in the 330i \\nnow the other aspect about the 320i which i which i personally think is far far more appealing makes \\nthis a far more appealing uh day -to-day drivi ng prospect than the 330i is the ride quality now um i think \\ni remarked before in the 330i the ride with the m sports suspension it\\'s just harsh it is a very firm riding \\ncar that uh i\\'m sure it will do fantastic on the race track you know you do it you tak e it on sapang you \\nprobably could be able to nick a decent lap but let\\'s say like out here on putrajaya where somewhere \\noccasionally you have a not as well surface patch of road that firm suspension runs the risk of bouncing \\nyou off the ground whereas here  with the 320i uh because the suspension has a bit more pliancy to it uh \\n\\nit keeps the four wheels in contact with the ground more consistently and as a result you are able to \\ndeploy the car\\'s power with more confidence and assurance so in real world terms in real world terms \\num you know once you you drive it in less than perfec t conditions the performance gap between this \\nand the 330i becomes noticeably smaller and you see like right now i\\'m taking this cloverleaf band so \\nthere\\'s a bit of body roll here but you know it\\'s well managed it\\'s just about well managed enough that \\nit gives me the confidence to push on to keep my foot firmly planted on the throttle and now as i as i as i \\ngo on these wide open roads here in uh in cyberjaya putrajaya i hardly find this car lacking for pace at all \\ni mean given a choice as a day -to-day uh da y-to-day package right as a day -to-day companion this is \\neasily easily a superior uh superior all -round package than the 330i right it\\'s to the point where right \\nlet\\'s say like even if i have that budget of 280 000 ringgit for the 330i i would still go for  this instead and \\nyou see the other thing right last time back in the days of the e90 the f30 choosing a 320i not only gives \\nyou lesser performance it gives you very bad cut levels of equipment it\\'s it\\'s you know it\\'s not the kind \\nof thing that is the kind  of thing that you you you think hey how can a 240 000 ringgit car be missing this \\nbut here right now here in this 320i uh yes i\\'m looking at a smaller infotainment screen but the other \\naspects of it i i lose out on the digital instrument cluster from the 330i fine with me because i think the \\nanalog cluster here looks way more pleasant that\\'s one thing uh i lose out on the m spot package no \\nproblem the standard the standard uh the standard body looks fine the is and in all honesty i prefer the \\ndesign of the se rims versus the m sport rims all right and you you still get keyless entry you still get \\nreverse camera which is which is of a fantastic resolution all right what is there to ask for and and also \\nthe ride in this car is so much more pleasant than the 33 0i all right that that all around whatever aspect \\nthat you look at it you know be it you know from a price point perspective from the level of from an \\nequipment perspective from a performance perspective from a driving perspective everything adds up \\nin fav or of this i would go as far as saying that within this segment within this price bracket this 240 250k \\nprice bracket there isn\\'t a better all -rounder than the 320i here i can absolutely find no fault with this \\ncar whatsoever so guys if honestly if if you are looking for you know if you are if you are shopping in this \\nprice range all right and if you come to me for recommendation for a car sedan car at 250 000 ringgit \\nprice bracket you don\\'t have to ask me anymore don\\'t have to drop me a line on facebook an ymore \\nbecause this this will be my default answer [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW X7  \\nReview:  \\nforeign Jacob and we\\'re going for a drive [Music] the refresh 23 BMW X7 xDrive 40i without launch \\ncontrol [Music] it\\'s not even the 6D no [Music] that\\'s good we\\'re spouring dark 375 horsepower 398 \\npound -feet of torque from a 3 -liter turbo inline six cylind er with a 48 volt mild hybrid system I\\'m gonna \\nput it back to Eco Pro in honor of the mild hybrid system okay fine okay I want to talk about the looks \\nfirst because yeah that\\'s what the refresh to me shows they got the different headlights very different \\nno more traditional BMW circular things I don\\'t mind these at all I actually like the look of this I think \\nmore than the previous version unless we\\'re talking about the Alpena xb7 which uh I think I like more \\njust because the cool wheels and everything and I like the previous one a lot better however I don\\'t \\nactually mind this one anymore after letting it absorb in my mind for like a month and then looking at \\nthe rear end we got slay different tail lights with cool designs and stuff in there I love them I re ally I \\nthink they did a great job with that yeah and then uh from the side it\\'s pretty much the exact same car \\nbut we got this cool paint which I\\'m pretty sure is the exact same from that Supra it does look similar \\nfrom what I saw in your video yeah so uh shout out Supra so Toyota colors and the next thing I want to \\ntalk about if we move inside some stuff has been refreshed things that I usually don\\'t like in newer \\nBMWs is this new infotainment screen where we\\'re missing the one to eight favorites and no ha rd \\nbuttons for your climate yeah and then we have that big one piece center screen which is actually two \\nscreens which looks nice yeah I got updated Graphics in the infotainment and then we also have some \\nupdated ambient lighting with this X7 thing which c hanges with the ambient lighting colors and the stuff \\nI think when you get like phone calls so that\\'s pretty cool and in this particular one we also have some \\nreally nice looking wood grain not too old people -ish this is like pretty modern yeah you could g et away \\n\\nwith it and I really like this pattern where the weird looking vents are yeah manual control but they\\'re \\ngetting close to Porsche territory yeah yeah but you can still touch them I think it looks pretty premium \\nand I actually do enjoy that and the best par t of this interior that I must mention you might have seen at \\nthe beginning of the video our newest sponsor tuxmad tuxmat is

vehicle and see what \\nthey have available yeah pause the video right now and go to this link up here it\\'s usually up here right \\nyeah I think it\\'s amazing yeah okay cliche Corner rip oh okay oh rotates it\\'s pretty goo d it\\'s just normal \\ngood BMW even though I\\'m in a comfort mode because sometimes you know you\\'re flying around you \\nneed to rip a corner there\\'s no time to yeah it\\'s uh it\\'s definitely a little body rolly it\\'s also adaptive air \\nsuspension as well so I kind o f expect that you think it drives better than the Telluride or Palisade \\nthrough there honestly kind of no no they have more power but maybe like handling not as uh yeah it \\ndidn\\'t it didn\\'t feel as cohesive and the Adaptive air suspension is really comforta ble just like the \\nprevious X7 was I have no complaints about the ride quality as I really shouldn\\'t in a BMW because this \\nis very expensive okay another nice thing about driving I guess is kind of considers Quality quality of life \\nis the radar Cruise Lane keep assist it\\'s like the old one you still get all those features the traffic jam kind \\nof stuff but I feel like this one doesn\\'t sway as much left and right like the Alpena xb7 did because this is \\na newer system so that is a great Improvement yeah I belie ve the system has been updated because this \\nis a refresh it\\'s an LCI but still not as nice as super Cruise in that Cadillac Escalade that we drove down to \\nPittsburgh for the Corvette thing but there were a lot of sections where the super Cruise wouldn\\'t wo rk \\nwhere this does work so yeah shout out BMW I guess yeah uh I mean everyone\\'s got their systems \\nevery system works a little bit differently and each one has its own advantages all right and then I got \\nanother silly thing I want to point out that this has  you know how I love the reverse mode that \\nautomatically backs you up up to 50 meters and BMW\\'s now we got up to 200 meters going backwards \\nand on top of that we can program a path forward okay and then when you get near there it\\'ll be like \\nactivated yeah and you just drive onto this imaginary line or whatever and it\\'s like you\\'re on a slot car \\ntrack and it actually works really well I think it\\'d be good for weird parking situations but I don\\'t know if \\nit would work underground because I think it works off satellite locations I think it\\'s a good feature for \\nbad drivers I personally would never use that feature but it\\'s nice to have I guess like if you go down that \\nlike narrow driveway that I did at my dad\\'s house in the X5 like that would be cool you could p robably \\nreverse through that like you just don\\'t have to think yeah I like to think yeah but you don\\'t have a crazy \\ntight driveway like I do sometimes trust me trust me bro it\\'s a good feature but another feature that you \\ntypically like this particular mod el does not have is a drive recorder yeah yo what the heck what the \\nheck well at least I can\\'t program it to my shortcut there and I can\\'t slide it down here it\\'s like yeah it\\'s \\nall touched it\\'s an expensive car give me the drive recorder and then I watche d a BMW video about this \\nand they were saying how it\\'s like and with less buttons available you now really benefit from the \\nintelligent personal assistant saying like it was a good thing and then uh yeah so this voice control can\\'t \\nget you to your SiriusXM  channels like hey BMW play SiriusXM channel 9. unfortunately the vehicle is \\nnot equipped with that function but it is equipped with uh salary radius I\\'m like well what the heck yeah \\nweird but it does have a remote start okay well which which is quiet acti vating the infotainment \\nbecause there\\'s a warning and they\\'ve got a cool new key fob and which shows three clicks turned on \\nwhich very very very very the key is an improvement from the previous key all right your turn to drive \\nLet\\'s Do It Don\\'t Clap oh loo k at these tux mats look at all the coverage on the side more than I\\'m not \\ngoing mad much more very cushy for my heels they are nice though really nice really nice what do you \\nwant to do launch control I got to set up my seat first oh it doesn\\'t go as low as I\\'d like it to oh yeah the \\n\\nmassage on I forgot about that put on your heated seats put on your heated steering wheel put on your \\nheated armrest I\\'d rather not do any of that right now because I\\'m gonna have to think too much yeah I \\nlike to think sport mode [Music] all right oh yeah that was good that is a really good launch for not \\nhaving official launch control for not having a 60i badge yeah exactly we\\'re not having an X does it have \\nan x no it\\'s an X drive because it\\'s all -wheel drive I\\'m at M yes uh so powertrain is basically the  same one \\nthat they\\'ve been throwing in everything recently the three liter inline six cylinder which is really good I \\ndo like it here the 48 volt again don\\'t really feel it much but you had some complaints about the brakes \\nyeah okay so up to the stop sign  like slow down and then like I\\'ll rip it and then I\\'ll go gently to the stop \\nsign a little bit slow but it\\'s the transmission the zf8 speed is really smooth okay so now I\\'m going to \\nslow down like a normal person would okay let\\'s go right here and yeah th ere\\'s yeah yeah okay now try \\nthis put your foot all the way it\\'s harder to be smooth put your foot all the way down yeah and now pull \\nback slowly like don\\'t you feel like there\\'s like a whole bunch of like dead zone stuff a little bit it\\'s a little \\nbit wei rd I wouldn\\'t call it a deal it reminds me of the Ford Maverick hybrid that we hated that like this is \\nlike deal breaker -ish to me I just don\\'t like it at all but I do like this powertrain it is much improved in \\nterms of horsepower and torque from the prev ious generation well from last year\\'s model so that\\'s \\nreally nice to have uh zf8 speed like I said is really smooth it\\'s not that quick you can use the paddles you \\ncan use this Crystal shifter thing because we no longer have a massive stick shifter so yeah  you put into \\nmanual and then it\\'ll automatically upshift which I expected to so here [Music] but it\\'s smooth which is \\nreally nice Graphics are nice yeah uh Drive modes we got sport we got sport individual you can also put \\nin a comfort Eco Pro and that\\'s a bout it I think we have comfort individuals as well or is it Eco Pro \\nindividual yeah you go pro individual and then the graphics change your gauge cluster changes don\\'t \\nreally love the gauge cluster it\\'s kind of this new BMW away so this is the way that it \\'s going to be you \\ngot the head up display that looks like a spoiler and stuff yeah it\\'s like wings going back and forth but \\nyeah this car drives really really well super comfortable love the Adaptive air suspension we also have \\nthe optional four -wheel ste ering on this so in parking lots and stuff like that it is quite noticeable so \\nthere\\'s this optional subscription or optional one -time payment uh I don\\'t know Yuri I think it\\'s actually \\njust a one -time I\\'m getting confused between my BMW and Mercedes okay through cliche corner and \\nyeah I mean this thing rips pretty hard pattern score mode than it was in Comfort yeah I think the \\nsuspension definitely tightened up and yeah it feels pretty good don\\'t send this in Eco Pro like Yuri did \\nbut I do want to talk abo ut the looks a little bit more specifically the grill I think it\\'s actually sort of \\nappropriately sized for this model I\\'m not upset by this Grill oh it\\'s been the appropriate size to hold I\\'m \\nstill going to photoshop so I get more clicks on my BMW thumbna ils but like since that first X7 it\\'s been \\nthe right size I don\\'t love the headlights however the Grille on this one for 500 extra dollars which we \\ndefinitely check that option box it lights up and you can set that up while it\\'s parked or something but \\nsom etimes when you talk to the infotainment it\\'ll tell you that you don\\'t have it yes hey BMW turn on \\niconic Grill hey BMW kidney Grill lighting can only be deactivated when the vehicle is stationary and the \\nengine is off okay I think it\\'s like when you start  the car thing but not while driving pretty specific but all \\nright whatever so we do have that feature uh what about the visors inside three two one they pass we \\nneed them today and just like all BMWs cup holders are great in front of the shifter area and they\\'ll fit a \\nsmall medium whatever large it\\'s got heated cooled Cup holderness and the crystalness is actually an \\noption which I mean I really like it they\\'ve got the the area for your phone and I guess you\\'d have to put \\nyour phone there as well if you\\'re  using your phone to unlock and all that kind of stuff oh yeah because \\nthis has like a phone as key as a feature yeah it\\'s got all that kind of stuff you can connect to the app and \\neverything which is like nice BMW stuff but I didn\\'t log into the app this time no and then uh rear seat \\nroom is quite good because it\\'s an X7 we had a bench before or no usually we have Captain shares I \\ndon\\'t recall but if you look at your leg room and look at your feet we got some nice talking yes we do full \\ncoverage more cover age than the little ones that came with it and what\\'s cool is on certain cars I got my \\nCX-5 it comes all the way up against the back so if you have muddy boots and you hit your heels against \\nthe back it\\'s not going to mess up your carpets on your car exact ly and then this is also a three row SUV \\nuh it\\'s okay in the third row that\\'s all I\\'ll say sunroof up there though yeah luxury the trunk room behind \\nis like just enough for carry -ons but if we fold everything down lots of room and then in the front here \\nthese seats are very comfortable no issues we do have massaging as well as an option and then we have \\n\\nadjustable bolsters I love these seats I love these seats you know uh you said the m340i you couldn\\'t get \\nyourself comfortable in there yes the second I left I the filming I realized like I couldn\\'t get myself \\ncomfortable and the brake pedal so just like a  little bit more time but these are lovely these are great \\nand then uh the back has peasant blockers oh yes electronic as expected in a BMW got the cool like \\nambient lights in the roof and stuff too yeah inside\\'s really nice uh also back to the outside the  wheels \\nthey\\'re 23 inches for the first time officially on a BMW but I believe the Alpena ones are also 23s they \\nlook really really good and I love like that combined with like raising and lowering it how you can get it \\njust looks so perfect The Stance is 10 out of 10. and today just for fun instead of a continental \\nrecommended tire what do we want to do go to continentaltire.com the straight pipes check out your \\nContinental recommended tire and there\\'s currently a promotion for a 70 Visa prepaid gift card which \\nincludes some summer and winter tires check out continentaltire.com straight pipes for the full list and \\nfull details get your winter tires on your car right now by the time you watch this it might be borderline \\ntoo late but it\\'s never too late go to  the shop and get them yeah and there\\'s even the new extreme \\ncontact sport zero two which is a brand new tire that is officially launched that is also included in the \\npromo before we get the price is another cool thing I want to mention so we\\'ve got our pa rking assist \\nbutton but then there\\'s like a blank yeah because I think it was a different parking button and they kind \\nof made it all into the same button into the same parking mode stuff oh because one would have been a \\ncamera one would have been an assis t like all like in there and it\\'s all nice 360 camera stuff okay I really \\nlike it no it\\'s just that I I do miss having a place to rest my hands still because now I\\'m not I\\'m just \\nserious I missed the one to eight buttons yep so let\\'s get to the price hit m e with the price this one \\nstarts at 108 500 Canadian and this one is optioned out to 130 250 dollars it\\'s not even the 60i no that\\'s \\na lot of money already so then would you take this over and Escalade with super Cruise because I\\'m \\nthinking I go escalate I  go to tsb.truecard.com get an Escalade instead of this I mean I really like this I \\nwould definitely consider it see the kind of deals that you might be able to get on this I do like this more \\nthan the GLS we did a comparison last year or two years ago wit h the pre -refresh of this so yeah I mean \\nI really like this SUV this or an eqs SUV Yuri the eqs SUV is dead to me I love this thing especially in \\ncomparison to the Mercedes electric stuff and we are going to hopefully one day do the i7 the electric \\nBMW 7 S eries and I think of that is the eqs killer oh that reminds me in the back seat we don\\'t have rear \\ninfotainment anymore but they have Clips so you can use your iPad or whatever mobile device because \\nthat\\'s all we really want in cars yeah so let us know wha t you guys think of this refresh LCI lifecycle \\nimpulse vehicle X7 thing does it look better than the previous one yeah yes and check out tuxmat.com \\nthank you so much for sponsoring us and supporting our sponsors guys keeping our carpets clean yes \\n[Music]  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW X7  \\nReview:  \\nthis is the heavily revised BMW X7 and never before has it been such a dramatic change in look since \\nAdele lost all that weight now in this video I\\'m going to tell you about the changes BMW have made to \\nthis car talking to the exterior the interior see how  practical it is take it for a drive and of course I\\'m \\ngoing to launch it to see how quick it is from naught to 60 miles an hour because this is the range \\ntopping M60 version and I\\'m Matt Watson and you\\'re watching car wow Buy sell car wow so then what \\nare the main design changes BMW have made to the X7 well at the back they\\'re giving it some new tail \\nlights which are quite shapely also a redesigned bumper this being the m60i has an even more \\naggressive rear bumper and look quad tail pipes these are exagger ated surrounds but within there are \\nreal exhaust pipes which is a good thing moving down the side alloy wheels now start at 21 inch in \\ndiameter as opposed to 20 for the pre -facelift version and go all the way up to 23 inches this M60 model \\ngets M door mirr ors look whoa thistleable and M badging there and what looks like air breathers though \\nthey don\\'t breathe in here they\\'re fake biggest change though is here at the front it\\'s quite different to \\nthe prefaceless version isn\\'t it massive massive change most n oticeable the headlights where they\\'re \\nsplit I much prefer this new design you still got a big grill but the bumpers have been slightly tweaked \\nand on this M60 version obviously they\\'re more aggressive I mean look at all these intakes and stuff like \\nthat a nd you\\'ve got your that and it also gets black accents instead of silver now the starting price of the \\n\\nX7 is 85 000 pounds this one though 115 000 pounds now you can save an average of five thousand \\npounds off an X7 through Carlo and if you want

upload some photos give a brief description then dealers all across the \\ncountry will bid on your car it\\'s dead easy now if you want to do all that at a later date just simply \\nGoogle help me Carl wow and we will help you change your car BMW has reworked the inside of the X7 \\nas well so you\\'ve got a slightly redesigned center console with a new smaller gear selector rather than a \\nbig knob and you get the crystally bits as standard all very nice another big change though the \\ninfotainment screen which is one big curved display like you get on the I4 and The IX and they\\'ve \\nupgraded the infotainment system itself as well now to tell you the truth I do prefer the infotainment \\nsystem on t he Mercedes GLS and if you want to see my full in -depth video review of that car click on the \\npop-out button up there for the link in the description below now you\\'ve probably noticed the air vents \\nare a bit different not sure about these directional contr ols look a bit tacky also there\\'s this logo on the \\ndash now which on this M60 has an M on it speak of the M60 also gets an M sport steering wheel with \\nM logo and M stitching you get M on the display and M dials as well you also get M stitching here on the \\nseat belt plus M on the kick plates all very very nice quite in here yeah very good lovely leather as \\nstandard on this M60 you get like black here but this is the upgraded optional carbon fiber storage is \\npretty good the glove box that would be a decent si ze if it wasn\\'t for the fact that you have these little \\nair fresheners in here look oh not sure about the smell of that smells like a Musky deer if you even got \\nheated and cool cup holders how luxurious is that door bins are large as well Plus you\\'ve got a n \\nelectrically operated steering column that true feeling of luxury but is it as luxurious in the back seats \\nlet\\'s find out here in the middle row of the X7 there\\'s absolutely loads of Headroom knee room that\\'s all \\nright and this seat is in as far forward a position as it can go because actually I can move it back \\nelectrically look at that to create even more knee room and I can recline it as well look for added \\nComfort but really there\\'s enough space with it in its most forward position which is better for  people in \\nthe rainbows row which I\\'ll show you in a moment also it\\'s quite a wide car so you can fit thread UPS \\nacross this center row no problem at all and because the back doors open nice and wide it\\'s so easy to \\nget in and out of and to install a big b ulky rear -facing baby seats plus the isofix anchor points are dead \\neasy to get to there\\'s some other nice features as well such as these airplane style pockets on the seat \\nbacks you\\'ve got your USB in there as well Clump control in the back more USBS down there big door \\nbins huge rear windows you\\'ve got blinds to the rear windows integrated into the door keep prying eyes \\nout and look at this this particular version being the M60 he has an Alcantara headlining for added \\nloveliness plus yeah you get the M log o on the seat belts even back here let\\'s check out the room I \\nthrow do you know what it\\'s really quite impressive back here Headroom is good knee room that\\'s all \\nright and this seat is in a position which has adequate knee room for the person in front ther e\\'s an all \\nright amount of foot space and you can just about slide your feet underneath the chair in front though \\nit\\'s better if you sit in this seat because of the way this seat splits 60 40. the seats themselves are quite \\ncomfy and they\\'re not too low to  the ground like they are in some other seven seaters so you have a \\ndecent amount of under thigh support there\\'s some other nice features back here as well for instance \\nlook you\\'ve got your USBS there you\\'ve also got cup holders big Windows there\\'s isofix even back here \\nand look at this you\\'ve got your own climate controls and the best bit of all your own sunroof in the very \\nback there\\'s one thing that\\'s missing back here the m60ness doesn\\'t extend to the very rear lock on \\nthese seat belts no end stitching anyway let\\'s move on to check out the boat one of the things I love \\nabout the X7 is that you get oh yeah a split folding tailgate always call those give you some places to sit \\nanyhow with seven seats in place the big capacity is 326 liters which is actuall y pretty big part of the \\nreason for that is that you have some underfloor storage there quite a lot of it that\\'s cavernous and \\nthere\\'s room lock for the Low cover to be stored under there now if you need more space and you\\'re \\nnot carrying seven people you can fall down this rear most row so here we go they do this thing this is \\nwhy this is useful look I can sit here while I wait for that to happen now there is 750 liters of space it\\'s \\nhuge if you want even bigger fold the lock down come on it\\'s absolutely m assive turn this thing into a \\nvan now you might be thinking about all this electrical seat operation is a bit too fancy and it adds to the \\ncost and if you\\'re after a seven -seater that\\'s very big and a lot less expensive than this X7 I found one \\n\\nthrough car wire and there\\'s a good offer on it if you want to see what that car is and the deal click on \\nthe pop -out band up there for the link in the description below now present to five or nine things about \\nthe BMW X7 BMW\\'s extendable seat bases are re ally good for giving some extra under thigh support \\nhowever the design of them means that often crumbs can get trapped in there okay he\\'s been eating \\nPringles in his car you know the rules for such an expensive car you\\'d think that it would have a special \\nwasher system for its rear view camera because in weather like this it gets absolutely covered in Grime I \\nmean look at that means you have to get out and clean it with your finger so you can get a view of \\nwhat\\'s behind you it\\'s better another thing you\\'d e xpect in a car of this price is some form of soft lining \\nin the door pocket so that things don\\'t rattle about in there when you\\'re driving along literally \\neverything is controlled through this screen so if you want to do the climate you have to press that and \\nthen you can control things like the fan speed bit of a fast even worse though is before when you want \\nto use the adaptive cruise controller an ultimate amount of distance the car keeps you from the car in \\nfront used to be able to do it by pressing a b utton on the steering wheel nice and easy now though you \\nhave to go into a driving mode so select this feature go to driver settings go into driver assistance and \\nthen go into distance control and then you can change it what off that also this is the sport y version the \\nM16 sometimes you might want to turn off the traction control to do that in the past you used to just \\npress this button here hold it down and it would turn it off but now it brings up this menu and then you \\nhave to press the button you want w hen you\\'re driving this is stupid this carbon fiber trim looks cool but \\nthe high gloss finish is very reflective and you can see flickering as you\\'re driving along past trees and \\nstuff like that then there\\'s this ambient Lighting on the M60 version looks r eally nice when it\\'s little at \\nnight the only problem is you get really bad reflections of it in the windows once again very distracting \\nit\\'s not all negative though here\\'s five good things about this car unlike some other supposedly sporty \\nmodels from som e German manufacturers this BMW will not automatically change upper gear when \\nyou reach the red line if you\\'re in manual mode you\\'ll have to do it yourself there\\'s a rev counter I\\'m in \\nfirst he\\'ll just sell the limiter unless I go and off we go again thank  God for that full control not only is \\nAndroid auto widescreen on the main part of the internet system it can even display Google Maps on \\nthe digital drives display not many cars do that you can load the car down its air suspension to make it \\neasy to load by pressing this button I\\'ll show you it working now so I\\'ll press the button then leave my \\nthumb here at button height and you\\'ll see how much it drops it seems to be going up first and now it\\'s \\ngoing down it\\'s not the quickest and it does only give you a n extra few inches but an extra few inches \\nare always welcome the ambient Lighting in the car actually extends to the sunroof that you can change \\nthe color it\\'s really cool look it\\'s yellow let\\'s move through some of them go to green we\\'ve got a sort of \\nBluey color there oh very nice and we can go for a purple burlesque experience and finally I think I might \\nleave it on a orange nice that the m60i version gets them upgrades to its chassis so the center Fit air \\nsuspension is retuned for a sportier drive you also get active anti -roll bars and standard rear wheel \\nsteering as standard and there\\'s even a limited slip differential on the rear axle plus there\\'s M sport \\nbrakes too the engine lineup on the X7 is really simple there\\'s a three liter straight six turbo diesel with \\n352 horsepower or three liter straight six turbo petrol with 381 horsepower or this wonderful 4.4 liter \\ntwin turbo V8 with 530 horsepower it\\'s a proper M engine built by BMW\\'s M Division and it will go in \\nthe next M5 probably with more power th ough now the engines drive all four wheels one eight -speed \\nautomatic gearbox so which version of the XM would I choose engine and trim well what I\\'m going to do \\nis configure my perfect excellent using the car wire configurator and if you want to see what t hat car is \\nexactly and the deal deal through color click on the pop -out band up there for the link in the description \\nbelow okay let\\'s see what the X7 is like to drive it\\'s run off within town so you get a great view out nice \\nelevated driving position dece nt sized back window though those remote seats if you\\'ve got the \\nheadrests up do block The View somewhat also it\\'s quite a big pillar and the door mirrors for such a big \\ncar could do with being a little bit larger I could probably have made it to that Gap easily but playing it \\nsafe because it is quite a large car though doesn\\'t feel as large as a Range Rover however with the Range \\nRover you have the benefit of sitting even higher up so it feels a little bit more Regal than this one thing \\nI think this is rea lly good at though is the combination between the engine and the gearbox when you\\'re \\njust pootling around in town it\\'s so smooth so effortless really easy to drive the suspension also does a \\ngreat job of dealing with the Buns considering this is the sporty  version I\\'m just going to do U -turn to \\n\\nshow you the Turning Circle because this M60 version comes with rear wheel steering as standard and \\nthat means that the Turning Circle comes down to 12.4 meters which clearly isn\\'t enough for this \\nparticular system situation interestingly if you have a Ran ge Rover with a rear wheel steering it\\'s turning \\ncircle is 11 meters which is much better and the Range Rover Would Have Made It round that turn if you \\nwant to see my full in -depth video review of the new Range Rover click on the pop out there for the link  \\nin the description below right let\\'s go out of town and stretch this car\\'s legs so here\\'s some dual \\ncarriageway I\\'m cruising up 40 I\\'m going to floor it flooded but everybody lay down the gearbox for now \\nwhoa this engine is crazy it was like did you want me to go quickly yes he does and then this thing just \\nbuggered off that is intense I\\'m sure if I was in sports mode the gear change would have been quicker \\nbut you don\\'t tend to drive around in sports mode otherwise the car is holding too lower gear all th e \\ntime I\\'ve got to show you now actually sports mode now see I mean a higher gear like I\\'m going to \\nnormal Drive comfort and it\\'ll drop again there we go I\\'ll tell you what I\\'d speed this thing is really cool \\nand relaxing really really nice suspension just  deals with the bumps it like floats but always remains \\nplanted there\\'s not much road noise considering the size of those tires all I\\'m noticing is a little bit of \\nwind flitter from here that\\'s it but generally overall this is a really relaxing car to do s ome distancing well \\nit\\'s less relaxing is the economy if you have this particular version with the V8 80 miles to the gallon but \\nI didn\\'t help it by flooring it just but either way it\\'s not going to do much better than that it\\'s gonna get \\nexpensive go for one of the Diesels instead that\\'d be better finally then let\\'s try the X7 out on a twisty \\nRoad I\\'m going to go into sports mode which will stiffen up the air suspension go manual for the \\ngearbox as well [Music] right here\\'s a corner let\\'s see what it does it\\'s going to lean over much no it \\nstays completely flat really feeling the benefit of those active anti -roll bars which makes it stay so flat for \\na tall heavy vehicle it\\'s insane and even though I\\'m in sports mode this thing is riding over the bumps \\nvery very well it\\'s not skipping at all I thought it might do it\\'s still composed the steering\\'s precise there\\'s \\nnot much feel through it but you know this is a big SUV but it puts the car exactly where you want it to \\ngo and you can hustle this thing along like  something crazy obviously the Lesser versions aren\\'t going to \\nbe quite as Punchy or handle quite as sharply but all x7s are pretty impressive whatever Road you\\'re \\ndriving on and if you need to they can do a bit of off -roading as well not like Range Rover off-roading \\nbut off -roading enough for most people look at this is going around here whoa they get on the gas and \\nwow this engine is so good BMW says the X7 M60 can do not 60 in 4.7 seconds but let\\'s find out the \\nreality using my specialist timing gear her e I\\'m going to launch it let\\'s go brake boost launch control \\nactive whoa the traction considering the road is where it is insane no to 60. 3.91 seconds be able to do a \\nright bunch of blooming Liars [Music] so then what\\'s my final verdict on the revised BMW  X7 should you \\navoid it should you consider it should you shortlist it or should you just go right ahead and buy it well I \\nreckon you should shortlist the X7 it\\'s a really good luxury seven -seater SUV I hope you\\'ll enjoyed the \\nvideo if you did give it a li ke let me know if you agree with my verdicts in the comments below click on \\nthose windows there for some more videos and on that box there to go to car way to change your car \\nthe easy way  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW X7  \\nReview:  \\nthe X7 is the biggest vehicle BMW makes and for 2023 it\\'s got a host of updates including a new face For \\nBetter or Worse what\\'s up folks I\\'m Dave undercover editor -in-chief of autolist.com a sister company to \\nCarGurus the X7 is BMW\\'s full -size three -row lu xury crossover and it\\'s been around since 2019. not \\ncontent to rest on this Laurels BMW gave it a refresh for 2023 that includes this new face a new \\npowertrain that\\'s more powerful and more efficient and a host of tech upgrades inside but is that \\nenough to  beat Rivals from Mercedes -Benz Lexus Lincoln and Cadillac let\\'s go find out but before we do \\nbe sure to like And subscribe to this channel so you can get alerts on all of our future updates alright \\nlet\\'s take a look at the exterior of this new X7 and as y ou\\'ve probably noticed it\\'s the front where you\\'re \\ngoing to see the biggest change this is a new design that basically splits up the headlights so you\\'ve got \\nyour daytime running lights and your blinkers up here and then your headlights down here and this split \\nlook is something BMW is using on its higher end model so you\\'re going to see it here and you\\'ll see it \\n\\non the 7 Series sedan and frankly I\\'m glad they\\'re kind of limiting it to these vehicles and not trickling it \\ndown to the lower RN models because I\\'m not sure I like it as much as the rest of the BMW lineup be \\nthat as it may you actually have some interest ing details that BMW worked into this new design you\\'ve \\ngot a front end vent here that is actually functional the air passes through that and then out over the \\nfront tire you\\'ve got brush metal accents here and along the Grille you can get this Grille illu minated as \\nan option on this base model higher end models that\\'ll come standard and then down below you have \\nsome sensors for the active safety features but what do you guys think do you like this new look or do \\nyou prefer the original look on the X7 that\\' s been around since 2019 let us know in the comments below \\nanother thing I want to point out is that down below you\\'ve got this polished metal accent piece that \\nruns along the length of the X7 that\\'s all well and good except up here along the window and th en on \\nthe roof rails you\\'ve got brush metal so it\\'s a bit of a disconnect but whatever I\\'m not a designer and \\nthen at the back of the X7 really not much has changed it\\'s a very clean look overall I like that if you do \\nlook up close these tail lights have a  bit of a 3D LED look to them so that\\'s kind of cool and one last thing \\nto note is that while most SUVs the tailgate is one piece this one Still Remains split all right now to \\npowertrains and this is probably my favorite upgrade that BMW made to the X7 for  the 2023 model \\nyear this is the base model so it\\'s the xDrive 40i which means it has an inline turbocharged six -cylinder \\nengine paired with a 48 volt mild hybrid system it now makes a total of 375 horsepower and 383 pound -\\nfeet of torque that\\'s a bump of 4 0 horsepower and 52 pound -feet of torque over the earlier X7 so that\\'s \\nreally nice even better it\\'s more efficient thanks to that mild hybrid system it now is rated at 22 miles \\nper gallon overall that\\'s up one mile per gallon over the earlier X7 so overall  you get 21 miles per gallon \\nin the city 25 on the freeway and 22 overall all x7s are going to be paired with an 8 -speed automatic \\ntransmission and full -time all -wheel drive so what do you guys think is 375 horsepower enough for a \\nvehicle this big let us k now in the comments below because if it\\'s not BMW also offers the m60i that\\'s a \\ntwin turbocharged 4.4 liter V8 with 523 horsepower and 553 pound -feet of torque it too has a 48 volt \\nmild hybrid system with auto start stop and M sport exhaust and then on top  of that there\\'s the Alpena \\nxb7 version of the X7 that also has a twin turbo 4.4 liter V8 but in that case it makes 631 horsepower \\nand 590 pound -feet of torque all right now to the interior and this is another area where BMW gave the \\nX7 a pretty thorough m akeover the biggest thing you\\'re going to notice is this curved display here this is \\na 12.3 inch screen for the instrument panel and then a 14.9 inch screen that\\'s a touch screen for the \\ninfotainment system and I like the way that it\\'s set up I like the di splay it\\'s very futuristic and forward -\\nlooking that\\'s pretty cool I will say there are some things that I don\\'t like and mainly it\\'s the menus and \\ndisplay for the instrument panel they just get a little wonky a little hard to navigate sometimes so that\\'s \\nbeen frustrating trading as we\\'ve been driving this car but overall this infotainment screen has been \\npretty good what I like is that it is a touch screen up here and then you have redundant controls physical \\nbuttons down below so however you like to use th e screen you can do that that\\'s pretty nice it has \\nWireless Apple carplay and wireless Android auto I\\'ll show you a carplay right here takes up the full \\nscreen very responsive screen nice and easy to use very bright and crisp there\\'s also a voice activated  \\npersonal assistant and on paper it should be pretty easy to use you just hit a button on the steering \\nwheel and issue any number of commands from turning on the heated seats or turning on the heated \\nsteering wheel things like that I\\'ve been using it for t he past week and that\\'s why I said on paper it \\nshould be easy to use because the reality is pretty different every time I hit a button and tell it to do \\nsomething it asks me to repeat myself multiple times I end up just getting pretty frustrated and using \\njust the screen functions or the buttons down below so just something to consider another thing that \\ngets a little frustrating about this screen is the climate functions now as you can see down below you\\'ve \\ngot the temperature controls for both the driver and the passenger here they\\'re always here displayed \\nno matter what else you have on that screen so that\\'s a nice touch but to get to the actual fan speed or \\nanything else you want to do for the climate you got to hit this climate menu and then this whole screen \\npops up it\\'s kind of an elaborate complicated screen you\\'ve got the heated steering wheel functions \\nthere it\\'s just annoying that if I want to hit the fan speed I\\'ve got to go through all these menus rather \\nthan just having a button very easily acce ssible down below so that\\'s just frustrating I wish BMW and \\nany other manufacturer that does this just had easily accessible buttons for those features another \\nthing to note is not everything that you see here is standard the X7 that we\\'re testing starts a t 78 000 \\n\\nincluding destination for the six cylinder engine the one we\\'re testing has a total sticker price of about \\nninety seven thousand dollars so part of what you get for that big up charge is the four thousand dollar \\nexecutive package included in that are these  massaging heated and cooled seats that\\'s a nice touch and \\nalso adds glass controls for the shifter here and for the infotainment knob we\\'ve seen that in other \\nBMW models that we\\'ve tested before you also get goodies like a 464 watt 16 speaker Harman Kardo n \\naudio system it\\'s a great sounding system in here you\\'ve got heated and cooled cup holders it\\'s a nice \\nlittle touch and soft closing doors in terms of connectivity you\\'ve got a standard USB port right here \\nyou\\'ve got a Wireless smartphone charging pad in  front of the cup holders and then a USBC charge port \\nin the center console here overall there are some things to like about the interior and some things I \\ndon\\'t like in general it is a very comfortable very luxurious very high quality feeling place there\\' s nothing \\nthat feels cheap or where they cut any Corners so that\\'s nice Definitely what you would expect on a \\nvehicle that\\'s cost ninety seven thousand dollars like this one you\\'ve got a stitch dashboard the seats are \\nvery comfortable very Supple you also have a really nice suede headliner so all of those things do add up \\nyou\\'ve got some weird shapes both in the vents here and this sort of translucent panel and then above \\nthe vents over on that side and by the drivers just a little weird doesn\\'t quite give you the harmonious \\nlook you might expect in a luxury SUV like this one all right now to the second row and as you would \\nexpect I mean 100 000 luxury SUV this is a very comfortable place to be I\\'ve got the seat set where I \\nwould have it I\\'m six foot one so basically I\\'m sitting behind myself and as you can see plenty of room \\nfor my feet my legs my knees my toes and then Headroom you would expect that again on a vehicle this \\nlarge nice features to have back here include power seats before and a half they also  require line I\\'ve \\ngot power sun shades and I can control them on either side from both this door or that passenger door \\nas well that\\'s pretty cool down here I\\'ve got my own climate control functions including the buttons for \\nthe heated seats back here tha t\\'s nice to have and then you\\'ve got a storage space and even further \\ndown below you\\'ve got a pair of USBC charge ports if that\\'s not enough each of these seats has another \\nUSBC charge port built into the back a couple more features that make life enjoyabl e in these rear seats \\nyou\\'ve got a standard panoramic moon roof that comes in all X7 models that\\'s nice to have you\\'ve got a \\nreally nice armrest here with some cup holders a little extra storage space and then down below the \\ncenter floor right here is almo st flat so you can put taller people in this middle seat and it\\'s not the \\nPenalty Box it might be in other models now because this is a luxury three row crossover of course these \\nseats are power operated which actually is really frustrating this is one cas e where they\\'re just \\noverthinking it right let me show you how slow this is to get to the rear seats I\\'ve already hit the button \\nright so now the driver\\'s seat is moving out of the way this is going to slide out of the way imagine you \\nhave kids right now t hey\\'re trying to get in the car everyone\\'s waiting we\\'re still waiting still waiting \\nthat\\'s a really slow seat and now you can get in the access is good once it finally gets there but man I \\nreally just wish there was pull straps these are pole straps but t hese are really more for an emergency \\nyou\\'ve got one here for the back seat passengers and one here for the side but overall again just give \\nme a pull strap where these seats move out of the way very quickly and the kids can get in the back \\nonce you finall y get back here and the seats slowly adjust back to their original position you do have \\nsome good space back here I\\'ve got the middle seat adjusted to where I had it again I\\'m six foot one so \\nI\\'m sitting behind myself and I could ride back here for a good amount of time I\\'ve got plenty of room \\nfor my feet and my knees my head does hit a little bit but overall it\\'s not that bad another nice thing is \\nthat you\\'ve got another glass panel up here really sort of opening up the cabin that\\'s helpful and again \\nI\\'ve got my own climate controls even in this third row that\\'s again a really nice feature to have where \\nyou\\'re not getting too hot or too cold just based on what the people are doing in front of you another \\nthing that\\'s annoying about these third row seats is that there\\'s no way for me to adjust where this \\nmiddle row is so if I need more space it\\'s dependent on the person in front of me moving in the seat for \\nme I wish BMW had just built in a button or a lever or any way to adjust where the seat is at the back \\nthe X7 offers 12.8 cubic feet of space behind this third row of seats when they are folded all the way up \\nif you do fold those down you have just under 49 cubic feet of space behind the second row of seats \\nnow that puts the X7 on the smaller side when it c omes to Interior Space of luxury three -row crossovers \\na couple of other things to note again this is a split tailgate so it opens about two -thirds of the way up \\nand then the bottom third opens down that\\'s kind of nice actually because it gives you a little  platform \\n\\nto sit on in case you\\'re tailgating or doing anything like that in the back you do have these power \\nbuttons to fold all the seats and what I like is that there\\'s a One Touch button that you can hit and all \\nthe seats will fold up or a button you\\'ll hit and all those seats will fold down so you don\\'t have to be \\nhitting multiple buttons at the same time all right driving Impressions now because this is a BMW you \\nprobably expect it to handle well and have really good Dynamics and the good news is it does the ke y \\nthing to note is that this refreshed X7 has a standard air suspension and it\\'s been re -tuned and \\nrecalibrated and I really like what BMW has done for that retuning that\\'s because in Comfort mode both \\nin this version and the earlier version it does feel l ike you lean a little bit too much the vehicle feels a \\nlittle ponderous but now when you put it into sport mode it definitely sharpens everything up and feels \\nlike you would expect a BMW to feel like that\\'s really nice previously when you put the X7 into s port \\nmode you really didn\\'t feel much of a difference so I\\'m really liking the fact I just hit one button and I\\'ve \\ngot the BMW that I was expecting what I also like is how Supple this suspension feels now remember we \\nhave 23 inch alloy wheels on this vehic le that\\'s a really big wheel a lot of times when you put something \\nthat big onto a vehicle you really are affecting the Dynamics it feels sort of rough over potholes or things \\nlike that not so here it feels like BMW took that into account when they tuned t he suspension so you get \\nthe best of both worlds you get these really nice looking Wheels really big but also a really comfortable \\nride so that\\'s a really nice feature that I\\'m appreciating and in terms of power that 40 horsepower bump \\nover the earlier ver sion of the X7 is definitely well received here 375 total horsepower feels great this \\ncar will do 0 -60 in 5.6 seconds now that\\'s not a lightning lap that\\'s not going to blow anyone\\'s doors off \\nbut overall this engine and powertrain are certainly enough to handle a vehicle of this size don\\'t think \\nyou need to step up to that twin turbo V8 to get the meaningful power although I will say that is an \\nexcellent engine so it won\\'t begrudge you if you do spend the extra coin there in terms of visibility it\\'s \\ngood i n this X7 but not great these a -pillars right here in front of me are kind of thick and then the B \\npillar the ones over my shoulder feel really thick so when you\\'re backing out of maybe a driveway or \\nwhen you\\'re looking over your shoulder to change lanes o n the freeway you definitely feel like you\\'ve \\ngot to look extra hard that gets a little frustrating and then out the back the rear window is actually \\nperfectly fine in terms of size but it\\'s the rear seats themselves that sit up kind of high and eat into y our \\nvisibility area so that gets a little annoying when it comes to competition the X7 is up against some \\nindustry heavyweights those include the Mercedes -Benz GLS the Cadillac Escalade the Lincoln Navigator \\nthe Jeep Grand Wagoneer and maybe even the Lexus  LX of all those competitors the Mercedes -Benz \\nGLS is probably the closest to this X7 they\\'re both unibody platforms they\\'re both German they have \\nreally great driving Dynamics they\\'re similar sizes if I had to choose the more luxurious version I\\'d go \\nwith  a GLS whereas this BMW is a little more Tech focused and has a little better driving Dynamics the \\nCadillac Escalade and the Lincoln navig Navigator those are built on truck platforms so they\\'re not going \\nto be as refined as this X7 but they\\'re also going to have more interior space and they\\'re also going to \\noffer bigger engines in terms of safety all x7s come standard with forward Collision warnings automatic \\nemergency braking blind spot monitoring with rear cross traffic alerts and Lane departure warnings  \\nalright folks there you have it our review of the 2023 BMW X7 Pros well we love the new powertrain it\\'s \\nmore efficient and more powerful than before and it\\'s great to drive on the road we also really like the \\nquiet and luxury feel of This SUV cons will th e front end look may not be for everybody and we\\'re not \\nsure we like it more than the earlier X7 plus the seating configurations inside can be frustrating and slow \\nto use and finally the interior space is down versus some of its Rivals so for reviews or li stings of this X7 \\nor anything else you\\'re

Model : 2023 BMW X7  \\nReview:  \\n\\nI fell hard for the X7 when I first tested it four years ago and then dialed it up to 11 last year when I \\nspent a week with the Alpena xb7 and now for its first refresh BMW is making the best even better \\nthere is no shortage of Ultra Premium SUVs over whic h to drool such as the Urus cullinan or bentega but \\nfor less than one hundred thousand dollars the BMW X7 isn\\'t playing second fiddle to any of them \\nrefreshed in all the right ways for the 2023 model year the X7 is BMW had its Sav best in a true standout \\nin the luxury three -row class when I first drove the X7 upon its debut in 2019 it was evident that BMW\\'s \\nlong -awaited three -row SUV was going to be a huge success case in point it outsold all of its Rivals last \\nyear including the Mercedes -Benz GLS and Audi Q7 and this substantial refresh will only increase the \\nx7\\'s desirability introducing BMW\\'s new design language for luxury models the heavily revised front end \\ninstantly changes the X7 stance to that of a more athletic machine with the split headlights an \\nilluminated Grille adding true distinction in M Sport Design and painted Brooklyn gray with optional 22 -\\ninch wheels and extended Shadow line trim this is one gorgeous SUV with presents for days looking \\nanything but base this is the xDrive 40i the entry leve l X7 priced from 78 845 it\\'s offered in luxury and M \\nsport designs to suit specific tastes an arrow kit sport seats special exhaust system and operated brakes \\nare just a smattering of the M sport goodies while this X7 also benefits from nearly every packag e and \\noption presenting itself as top of the line but without the executive package which includes glass \\ncontrols and massaging seats or a V8 this X7 is the first rung on the build sheet ladder msrps tested is 93 \\n745 making this a ride for the one percent but when compared to the astronomical prices commanded \\nby some of the aforementioned Elite SUVs the X7 is a bargain proposition for those whose egos need an \\nexotic badge Beyond its modernized appearance this X7 is more powerful and fitted with BMW\\'s \\nupdate d iDrive 8 infotainment system and curved display utilizing the latest 48 volt mild hybrid \\ntechnology the new turbocharged inline six -cylinder engine boasts 40 more horsepower and \\nconsiderably more torque than its predecessor while also improving fuel econ omy rated at 375 \\nhorsepower and 383 pound -feet of torque with a quick boost to 398 pound -feet under maximum \\nacceleration the X7 is a little quicker than before 0 -60 arrives two tenths faster at 5.6 seconds gas \\nmileage is also up a tick to 21 MPG City 25 Hi ghway stepping up to the v8 -powered m60i will lock more \\nthan a full second off of that time but this re -engineered six is spectacularly smooth and torquey \\nrendering more cylinders completely Overkill what can I say this is as good as it gets in the three -row \\narena it is spectacular from this Exquisite ride quality to the hermetically sealed cabin it\\'s everything I \\nwould want in a gas powered SUV it also drives like a BMW with All the Right Moves this updated cabin \\nis fresh and techy and when heavily optione d like this one it Pampers the driver and occupants as if it \\nwas your own personal concierge as for the negatives I don\\'t really have much for you other than to say \\nthat at nearly ninety four thousand dollars it should be this good the M sport exhaust syst em doesn\\'t \\ncontribute much auditory enhancement but paired with the new 8 -speed trans Mission with launch \\ncontrol this 40i is as slick and as quick as most every driver could want grab the left paddle shifter and \\nhold it to initiate Sprint all powertrain a nd Chassis systems go directly to their sportiest settings and the \\nelectric boost is activated it\\'s all very composed yet exciting but my favorite X7 attributes are its \\nremarkable ride quality and super hushed cabin the miles simply melt away in here as th e X7 makes \\nquick and seamless work of any road imperfections virtually eliminates body roll and fosters a sense of \\nPeace the air suspension retune chassis systems and active roll stabilization in addition to rear wheel \\nsteering make for an exceptional pass enger experience the range between comfort and Sport settings \\nhas been further extended with this update press the drive mode button whether it\\'s Eco Pro Comfort \\nor Sport and changes start happening the ambient lighting most pronounced on the X7 graphic in  front \\nof the passenger seat moves from Blue to red or any other color you\\'d like the body raises or lowers \\naccordingly the seats tighten or relax and the chassis morphs into whatever it is you desire typically this \\nX7 would be wearing summer use tires but  because of the season this one is fitted with Pirelli scorpion \\nwinter run Flats which work wonderfully I highly recommend them but the price is exorbitant over eight \\nhundred dollars per for the massively wide rear tires one of the x7\\'s Hallmark features i s its seating \\ncontrols and I don\\'t just mean for Comfort but I\\'m also talking about the various ways you can create \\npassenger and cargo space every row of seats in here is power operated six ways to Sunday and then \\nhere in the second row you get these nice  little pillows on the headrests there\\'s a USB type -c port \\ntucked away right there two more down below here on the center console you\\'ve got another two \\n\\nzones of climate control and then heated seats with three settings and then over here on the door there \\nare controls not only for the sun shades on both windows but also for the sun shades overhead here \\nand back there so at ninety four thousand dollars you  mustn\\'t do anything for yourself the neatest trick \\nis the ability to convert from Max people space to Max hauling by pressing a single switch in the cargo \\narea the power split fold tailgate also includes a button to lower the body for easier loading enter ing the \\nnicely sized third row seats is accomplished at the touch of a button which kicks off a Rube goldberg -like \\nset of seat movements as the front seats slide forward and the second row seats articulate up and away \\nit\\'s certainly a labor -free experience  but everything about these seat machinations takes a little too long \\nto complete also note that second row Captain\\'s chairs are optionally available but this tester goes three \\nacross to make it a true seven seater the smallest Center screen of the previou s year\\'s model was the \\nonly Telltale sign of Aging so BMW has gone full 12.3 inch curved display melding into a 14.9 inch central \\ncontrol display it\\'s a touch screen with tablet like tiles that can also be controlled via the typical iDrive \\nrotary controlle r or through voice with a wake -up word such as hey BMW it even responds to hand \\ngestures as part of the premium package it\\'s very modern with an augmented navigation system that \\nuses the front camera and directional Arrow overlays to bring reality to drivi ng directions the head up \\ndisplay is also packed with bits of information that transcends speed the surround View Camera gets its \\nown real button however I wish the climate controlled seats and heated steering wheel activations were \\nalso off the screen bec ause it takes a second or two to boot up what\\'s missing there\\'s no rear view \\ncamera mirror and there\\'s no hands -free highway driving the soft closed doors the extended welcome \\nlighting mat the heated armrests this new X7 had me at hello there\\'s also a judi cious use of \\nenvironmentally friendly materials employed such as the new leather -like sense of fin seating surfaces \\nassembled in South Carolina and also available as the v8 -powered m60i and soon as the range -topping \\nAlpena xb7 the X7 xDrive 40i is a dream machine

beneficiary of a \\nbrand new engine so new looks new engine new features this is no gentle update and it shouldn\\'t be \\nbecause the X7 m60i starts at 129 000 Canadian and this one is spec to 147 000 let\\'s have at it and if you \\n[Applause] we do car rev iews track tests and quite a lot of messing about so subscribe hit the Bell \\n[Music] mind control oh it\\'s quite a significant that is quite significant much control 0 -60 in 4.68 seconds \\nand that is with both of us in the car yep that\\'s pretty good that\\'s ve ry good it\\'s pretty good and I can \\ntell you how we\\'ve achieved that Thomas okay you\\'re probably wondering what that 60 eyes on the \\nback means I am because it was the V12 in the seven six m760i 60 I always meant V12 no longer a V12 \\nokay it\\'s a V8 it is a V8  but now this gets the new proper n engine the s68 which is what you\\'re going to \\nsee on all the new M cars right so you know it\\'s basically an all -new engine it\\'s got new crankshaft new \\nturbocharger technology new oil sump all of that comes together to mak e the 60i a very different story \\nto the 50i okay in the 50i in the m50i you\\'ve got 523 horsepower and 553 pound -feet of torque right in \\nthis you get 523 horsepower and 553 pound of torque as well yeah right all the new stuff and they\\'ve \\ntuned it to make th e exact same power as before which is not true for the 40i the 40i gets a 40 \\nhorsepower okay and it\\'s not true if the incoming Alpena which is getting a horsepower bump 18 \\n\\nhorsepower bump to 630 so just to recap that entire explanation that you just gave us and me and the \\naudience yes was pointless no because the main reason they did it is because I don\\'t think they were \\nmeeting the efficiency standards engines okay so the 6 0i straight up replaces the 50i well it\\'s not any \\nquicker it has no more power but it\\'s capable of more power and more importantly your friend the \\nsucker who\\'s just bought a Range Rover a brand new Range Rover doesn\\'t have this engine get to the \\nm50i engin e the old engine so really you\\'re winning well it is a nice engine it sounds pretty cool I\\'m in \\nSport Plus right now and you know what I didn\\'t know that I had to look it up because it doesn\\'t feel any \\ndifferent things that don\\'t feel that different becaus e first of all it\\'s already quite an impressive vehicle \\nthe X7 we\\'ve always liked it in Sport Plus mode it gives you like well this also has the M Sport Pro so it\\'s \\ngot the more aggressive exhaust right and also in a pretty cool feature as well we\\'re talki ng about \\ndrivetrain really quickly put this in Comfort mode we cruise around I have a big issue with Comfort \\nmode I\\'ll tell you about that in a second but if I hold this left paddle it puts me in Sprint mode and \\nstiffens everything up for a second and make s the transmission snappier and thanks to the 48 volt mod \\nhybrid yeah which this now gets still the same horsepower but it now gets a 48 volt lot hybrid so not \\nonly does it make start stop smoother it actually just throws a bit more torque also new for the  LCI X7 is \\nthe addition of active anti -roll bars engineered to attain maximum softness when desired but able to \\nfirm up when required I only really had one issue with it it doesn\\'t work well before you say that you uh \\nyeah I mean so the idea behind it and they say it\\'s to reduce the amount of head that you get the \\namount you get tossed no no head toss wow those words really have to yeah you have to get the \\ncorrect order is vital is to reduce the amount of head tossed you get tossed head no no no no no no no  \\nno no no no it\\'s the amount of head toss you get while you\\'re moving it in premature we\\'ve experienced \\nn60i for mature above 60. so so basically what it does is it in Comfort mode in a straight line it keeps \\neverything really soft so you it should control  side to side motions but allow the ride to be nice the \\nproblem is I don\\'t don\\'t say that to me when I\\'m in the code the Comfort mode what we\\'re in right now \\nare you getting some head toss yeah yeah it\\'s not good and it\\'s not a good kind no um I I find so the goal \\nthere was to be able to go softer without losing without right now you feel that yeah once you load it up \\ninto a corner it tightens them up and we\\'re fine but in the entry in the exit of the corner I\\'m getting \\nthrown all over the place compared to  an Escalade V we just were in the Escalade V and you said that \\nwas a master class in chassis engineering it is because that that car it just somehow controls motions in \\nexactly the right way yeah I will say though that in Sport Plus mode right now of all the big SUVs this \\none\\'s driving close to the best it it drives smaller than it is like you have to remind yourself you\\'re in an \\nX7 yeah you\\'re not back there\\'s another road there\\'s another row yeah it\\'s like the steering is good \\nweights up naturally all th e calibration of the throttle and the brakes of sport mode is good and there\\'s \\nnot too many unnecessary motions in Sport Plus guns but you\\'re just leaving it in Sport Plus mode wake \\nup in the morning Sport Plus mode have a coffee Sport Plus mode Drive the kids to work kids don\\'t go to \\nwork you go to work you use Sport Plus mode but what about fuel economy what about you just bought \\na twin turbo V8 SUV how much can you truly care about silicon technically you\\'ve foregone the Escalade \\nV you\\'ve made a sensible  decision of okay yeah I guess the other option is a Supercharged V8 fair \\nenough but you know considering this is 7 series there isn\\'t much going on back here for me to like play \\nwith well you\\'ll notice this little thing here yeah there you go oh yes right  you can put a thing in there \\nthat holds on to your own eyes I do have a pillow though what a pillow Oh I thought we were in place of \\nan iPad that was confusing no I can\\'t see it yeah yeah that\\'s my comfort that\\'s my fun thing the whole \\ncar is very sharp i n Sport Plus mode which is where you should own the only place I don\\'t think I shoot \\nfor the Alpena you know I think this is all you need this is probably all you need you don\\'t need 630 \\nhorsepower I would even find a way to be happy with the 40i 40i yeah save some money all right well \\nyou know what a big part of this facelift is the way it looks so let\\'s let\\'s have a little chat [Music] thank \\nyou for bringing your weather with us by the way from England I tried to dress Canadian yeah you did \\nand it didn\\'t you succeeded yeah you\\'d fool someone I\\'d fooled everyone yeah I Pied Piper if rained us \\nyeah until they see you try and play hockey I can\\'t even skate on the ice that is okay yeah yeah all right \\nthis is an X7 yes um obviously by the massive Grill however the grill Is Now dwarfed by The IX yeah well \\nit\\'s different that\\'s a different shape a different shape but also but like this is like just huge it\\'s funny \\nactually years ago only a couple years ago when they first started the new design language yeah I \\n\\nremember when the X5 came out and the X7 came out I\\'m asking you on the phone I\\'m like I can\\'t tell \\nthe difference between the X5 and the X7 no and and you came up with a method so you\\'ll you\\'ll know \\nwhen you see an X7 because you\\'ll see it and you\\'ll be o ffended yes that\\'s the difference the exercise \\nlike oh that\\'s big but have you or have you not got used to it in these couple of years does this now not \\nlook complete I have got used to it I haven\\'t got used but I still regret there was a there was a sketc h \\nthat we wrote that ended up on The Cutting Room floor and I wonder if you remember this where we \\nwere going to accidentally crash the X7 and the grill was going to be broken and I\\'d have to go get a \\nreplacement part and I came back with a fence panel I\\'m  so glad we didn\\'t do that that\\'s one of the ones \\nwe didn\\'t do a lot of those the big difference now so this hasn\\'t actually changed in size to my \\nknowledge I don\\'t think so but we now have for the first time ever on a BMW yeah split headlights wow \\nyeah so  they made the headlights smaller so that the girl would look bigger it\\'s just this is the new look \\nnow the seven series is going to have this as well and it comes with the free condensation on the inside \\nno that\\'s that\\'s part of the spread effect for a wa rmer a war like a diffuser correct it\\'s a diffuser right \\nyeah okay um but they\\'re not the only people doing split headlights at the moment are they no I \\nthought that was something we were in recently what was that anyway I think it looks good you know it \\nhonestly is a good looking vehicle I have as you say got used to the grill it\\'s it\\'s great I would be so mad if \\nin like 15 years we look back on the current BMW design and we\\'re like wow you know what it was age \\ngreat and we and they nailed it I I refuse to  believe that\\'s the truth I don\\'t have a problem with it and \\nthey\\'ve added some stuff so the tail lights so first of all and Wing mirrors and Wing mirrors yes and \\nBarge on the front see my M2 does not have M Wing mirrors right and I was upset about that bu t every \\nnew non -full M that comes out that has these I get happier and happier that mine doesn\\'t have them oh \\nI see because it\\'s diluted yes so we\\'ve got this 3D patterning going on here yeah well that\\'s when it\\'s lit \\nit looks very cool I really like that not changed that much at the back though I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t go \\nwith the with the with the Halo sword tail lights look on the Xbox three yeah I\\'m surprised and then for \\nthe first time ever for a BMW yeah these are 22 inch but you can get 23 inch whee ls wow which the GLS \\nalready has this is these are the 22s this is definitely the move because the ride\\'s just gonna be better \\nwell they say that the 23 inches improve efficiency oh maybe less rolling resistance or something but \\nlike I\\'ll take a soft ride any day yeah right over over a liter per 100 kilometer but yeah so that\\'s good \\nbefore we get the uh Alpena this is as aggressive as an X7 is going to look right um but they\\'ve got some \\ncool stuff going on inside as well because that\\'s part of the update th e LCI let\\'s take a look [Music] yeah \\nit\\'s soft close it is yeah it is this thing this is a seven series as an SUV lifted and a part of that because \\nnow because with the XM has always felt like a big X5 yes and nothing more whereas it\\'s supposed to be \\na sev en so now we get I drive eight so I actually like iDrive 8 better but I don\\'t like the fact that it always \\nseems to be in a screen box TV glued to the dashboard like they\\'ve really gone all day so I described that \\nbadly terribly it\\'s a TV glued to the dash board it\\'s a square how else can you do a screen integrated into \\nthe thing and like before they like they had like the cool swoop on the corner right it was I missed my \\nswoop all right yeah I think it works really well and because this is the new one look at that the ambient \\nbar wow yeah so this so this is more ambient lighting first of all so it matches the color of the ambient \\nlight even though it\\'s great you can actually see it coming through the speaker even right now in the \\ndaytime but it also changes this if you get a phone call it does different things take a flash with a phone \\ncall it\\'s like it\\'s just like an effect bar kind of like the S -Class did with it\\'s like oh yeah but yeah that was \\ncool no no this is a really nice interior what we\\'ve just in t here was like similar oh uh the escalated V \\nEscalade V right we\\'ve just been a few competitors actually there in the Range Rover the Range Rover \\nyeah the Range Rover is similar price to this a little bit more the one we\\'ve had aspect the Range Rover \\nthen o n the inside was way more yeah this is much more German but it\\'s also very busy very athletic \\nand sporty right like it\\'s the carbon fiber well they of course it down it\\'s got this smooth single line air \\ncompound here these little crocodile heads these are cool you can spin them to lock it I don\\'t know \\nthey\\'re kind of weird they\\'re kind of fun to play with yeah they\\'re fun um speaking of things to play with \\nthere\\'s a a knob that\\'s got a bit smaller um that we\\'ve lost the shifter okay yeah a little piece of g lass I \\nwas trying to figure out where you were going yeah yeah the little glass shifting yeah little nubbing like \\nuh like the Porsche these words that you\\'re choosing it sounds right I believe that a nubbin is is that a \\nthird nipple it might be a third nip ple oh there\\'s a Chandler Friends Chandler yeah yeah that\\'s right so \\n\\nyeah that\\'s a bit of a strange move I I really did like the shifter before that so I don\\'t know why they did \\nthat but I guess it\\'s just space yeah it\\'s nice it\\'s a little kind of it\\'s a bit flashy with the Crystal but I guess \\nit\\'ll probably work fine and t his is a well optioned one so we\\'ve got the uh the cooled and heated cup \\nholders those are really cool yeah but nothing nothing has massively changed no like the cabin \\nbackwards is identical so yeah still comfortable for an adult in the middle still comfor table once we\\'ve \\nfinally moved all the chairs around which take ages by the way yeah um Harrison and I tested the back \\nseats with some difficulty yeah but we managed to uh managed to fit back there he doesn\\'t fit but \\nmyself at five foot ten I fit he\\'s also  a nice little like wind light was it a light sunroof sunroof there it is a \\nSolarium back there yeah no it\\'s coffee and then this uh is actually optioned with the tartufo leather \\nwhich holds a special place in our hearts um because Thomas and I went for a very nice dinner on his \\nhoneymoon uh at a place called tafu that\\'s true it\\'s true it\\'s a weird sentence isn\\'t it I went for a lovely \\ndinner with Thomas on his honeymoon this is one of that story actually this was uh his name this is a \\ntrip in Italy when Ja mes decided he didn\\'t like truffles at all and he wanted to take me to this one \\nrestaurant which he\\'d been to before and it was called tartufo and he\\'s like what\\'s this tattoo for mean \\nturns out it\\'s truffle but at the end of that trip at least Electronics  it doesn\\'t smell truffles in here no and \\nit\\'s very nice nice just to be clear my wife was on that in that restaurant was well it wasn\\'t just me and \\nJames told me what you want okay anyway this is nice I like it it\\'s it\\'s a it\\'s a bit like flashy and busy but \\nit\\'s well designed it\\'s intuitive it\\'s comfortable I I don\\'t really have any issues with this and I must say \\nthat I do like this version of iDrive better than the one that we only had for a year or two which was \\nwhat I drive seven seven maybe listen as  far as life cycle impulses go I think this is a pretty solid one it is \\nso there we have it the X and has been pulsed the split headlights might have some people split but \\nreally all the changes seem to be for the better compared to the Range Rover it\\'s no t quite as plush \\ninside but it\\'s cheaper it\\'s new looks distinguish it even further from the likes of its GLS rival and it drives \\na lot smaller than the big Americans if you were already an X7 fan the X7 just got better thanks for \\nwatching and a special th ank you to the jasons which admittedly

let\\'s start this video by talking about the prices of these two luxury SUVs so the X7 \\nrange starts from 85 000 pounds whereas the Range Rover extended wheelbase starts from 107 000 \\npounds however the cars I have here aren\\'t the entry level models so that is the X7 M60 that starts from \\n116 000 pounds and this particular Range Rover in this spec 127 000 pounds less price what really \\nmatters though  is the price you pay a dealer for instance through car while you can save an average of \\njust over 5000 pounds off the X7 range now if you want to go to car one now to check out the latest \\noffers click on the pop -out banner up there for the link in the des cription below and while I\\'m at it huge \\nthank you to Romans International who\\'ve led us this lovely Range Rover to review go check them out \\nLink in the description considering this Range Rover is one big slab of a car I mean look at it it\\'s one two \\nthree f our five big matte steps long it\\'s still somehow looks quite spelled maybe that\\'s to do with that \\nsloping roof line you know I do think that land Rover\\'s designers have done a fantastic job with this car I \\nlove how they\\'ve made it so smooth almost like a p ebble that\\'s been rounded after being washed over \\nmillions of years by the ocean this car is so aristocratic so Regal looking I love it just don\\'t get too close \\nto it because then you might notice that some of the panels don\\'t line up perfectly sorry to po int that \\nout my fellow midlanders in the solid Hall Factory put this card together I wonder if the Germans have a \\nsuperior attention to detail yeah let\\'s find out shall we so this increase on the body side of the X7 it \\ndesigned at 100 perfectly but it\\'s pr etty blooming close and it is better than on the Range Rover \\nspeaking of better this new face BMW of given the X7 is better than the pre -facelift version I like these \\n\\nsplit headlamps however in some ways it\\'s a little bit too aggressive for the rest of the car so the front is \\npretty much sports car then you look down the side and go oh yeah it\\'s a big family -friendly SUV overall \\nthough I think this design is all right i t wouldn\\'t put me off buying the car there really that isn\\'t what car \\ndesign should be about you know it should actively make you want the car like it does with the Range \\nRover look at it I just want it and I\\'m probably willing to forgive some other things  about it because it \\nlooks so good unless I had to do that with the X7 which means the interior better be bloody good \\nthankfully it is it looks really nice and quality is impeccable Everything You Touch feels expensive BMW \\nLos Interiors are among the very very best they\\'ve actually updated the interior of this car so it\\'s now \\ngot this new screen like you get on the I4 and The IX big long curved screen really nice high definition it\\'s \\nfairly easy to use for all the different controls touchscreen swivel wheel s gestures voice commands \\nthough most people are just going to run Apple carplay and Android auto one of the great things about \\nthis system is that BMW figured out how to mirror them map from Google on the digital driver\\'s display \\nmost manufacturers can\\'t do that for some reason I like that what I like less though is the fact that \\nthey\\'ve moved the climate controls into the touch screen so you have to do it through here rather than \\njust turning some knobs I\\'m also not so sure about these knobs they\\'re the o nly cheap bits of trim in this \\ncar like this Edition though like for this M60 version your M light there and when you change the driving \\nmode look at this oh yeah it changes color tiny things please tiny mines can the right driver\\'s interior \\ncompete with t his in some ways yes and in some ways no you see the interior design on the Range \\nRover is more simplistic than the BMW I like that I also like the fact that they haven\\'t put the climate \\ncontrols through the touchscreen so when you want to switch between t he temperature control the fan \\nspeed and the heated seat you have to port and push at this dial here the screen itself is nice and big \\nand it\\'s curved like in the BMW though in a different way to curve that way rather than that way once \\nagain really high d efinition screen I think it\\'s a little bit more laggy than the BMW system but it\\'s not \\noverly noticeable and when you press press and hit buttons look you get this click clickery it\\'s a bit of a \\nshame that you don\\'t get Apple carplay or Android auto Maps m irrored in the digital driver\\'s display but \\nthe display itself is bright and easy to read than in the BMW though to switch to the different menus \\nand settings it\\'s a little bit more of a faff well I can\\'t complain about though is the fact that you get \\nMeta l Gear select pedals in the Range Rover rather than the plastic ones you get in the BMW they just \\nfeel nicer to touch however there are some bits that are a little bit questionable for core of this price for \\ninstance the plastic used up here is of similar quality that\\'s your microwave meal comes in now you \\nmight be thinking Matt well he\\'s going to scratch that plastic up there no one does that but that\\'s just \\nfor me illustrating how cheap it is you can see just by looking at it that it is cheaper plastic an other thing \\nI can see is that whoever fitted this Hazard warning light button didn\\'t manage to get it on quite straight \\nlook it\\'s a bit wonky so these buttons here which open and close the glove boxes they\\'re wonky as well \\nthe wonkiest bit of all though is  a stitching along this Dash it\\'s completely on the piss what\\'s all that \\nabout Land Rover actually made a big thing about the range over going even further up marketing not \\nonly competing with the likes of the BMW X7 but also Bentleys well I\\'ll tell you on e thing Land Rover you \\nain\\'t gonna compete with Bentley you\\'re stitching like that to be fair though when you get into the back \\nseats of the Range Rover you do know some things which are actually quite badly like for instance this \\nparticular Range Rover ha s a leather roof lining it\\'s gorgeous that is this is the intricate mechanism of \\nthe grab handles you don\\'t get this kind of thing on just normal run -of-the-mill cars even the pockets on \\nthe seat backs just feel expensive and the mats they have a thick pil e then there\\'s a space itself back I \\nmean look at it I\\'ve got so much room loading room loads of Headroom to be fair this seat is as far back \\nas it will go but oh if you need to go three people from the back of once as well it\\'s no problem at all this \\ncar is so wide and so much space that there\\'s easily enough room for three people to sit in Comfort \\nsurely the BMW can\\'t be as accommodating as this huge Range Rover well didn\\'t know what with these \\nseats as far back as they can go it does feel almost as big a s the Range Rover look tons of neat room \\nheadroom\\'s really good as well the only thing is it doesn\\'t feel quite as wide maybe that\\'s because the \\nsizing to just curve in a bit more because it\\'s less boxy shaped than the rain drove up and you notice that \\nwhe n you have three in the back at once there\\'s not quite as much shoulder room between three adults \\nthere are a couple of other things that aren\\'t quite as nice as in the Range Rover for instance these \\nPockets just don\\'t feel quite substantial the pile of th e floor mats is a lot thinner well we do have a nice \\n\\nsuede like roof lighting doesn\\'t seem as luxurious as leather and yeah that\\'s just everyday cast of this \\ngrab handle nothing special there however one of the big selling points of these cars is the fact that they \\nare seven seaters so now it\\'s time to check  out the rimos row you might be wondering welcome to the \\ndriver\\'s seat to show you the rear Mouse Row in the X7 well because I first want to show you this \\nfeature you can actually give people access to the back by pressing this button here from the driver\\' s \\nseat so press it and the seats start to move there we go moving out the way obviously you can control \\nthe seats from buttons here and on the seat as well so once you like getting to the very back well the \\ngap\\'s large enough yeah so yeah you can climb in okay now I\\'m just gonna pull the seat back by pressing \\nthe button just up there see how much room we have okay oh it\\'s coming back a bit more so that\\'s it \\nquite far back not quite as far back as it\\'ll go and your room\\'s okay but I can actually slide this s eat \\nfurther forward and there\\'ll still be enough room for someone to sit comfortably in this seat so new \\nroom\\'s good Headroom no two fingers that\\'s okay that\\'s okay I reckon people who are a little bit taller \\nthan me will be fine in the back the seats are quite raised up from the floor so you don\\'t feel like you\\'re \\nsquatting or in a stress position and there\\'s cutouts underneath the seat speed to put your feet \\nunderneath it\\'s not so good if you\\'re this side because obviously the way this splits 40 60 means there\\'s \\nless foot room here than under that seat one thing I do like about this particular car though is not an \\nidea to have sunroof which goes to the front and the middle row you also have your own separate \\nsunroof here in the third row not sure if you ge t that in the Range Rover let\\'s find out uh no it doesn\\'t \\nseem to that\\'s a shame makes it look a little bit darker back there anyway let\\'s try and get into the back \\nso press this button to move the seat forward can\\'t do it in the driver\\'s seat unfortunatel y but there \\ndoes seem to be more room than in the BMW to get in I\\'m gonna have to move this seat so you can see \\nexactly what\\'s going on back here let\\'s go there it is while that\\'s happening let\\'s bring this one back \\ncome on come back because you\\'re told no w you can see from this angle that your knee room is okay \\nand I\\'m going to need that because actually Headroom is pretty tight especially if you sit back my head \\nis hitting against this Ridge here I\\'m 179 centimeters tall kids will be fine but anyone toile t me is going to \\nstruggle a little bit still there is enough need room for me to be able to slouch a bit and because there\\'s \\na decent cut underneath the seat in front I can fit my feet into there there\\'s more foot space actually \\nthan in the BMW another thi ng that I think is better in this in the BMW is these rear seats raise even \\nmore off the ground than the BMW so you\\'ve got more under thigh support so overall it is just a little bit \\nmore comfortable here in the very back compared to the BMW especially as you can get heated seats in \\nthe very back row here in the Range Rover once again I\\'m going to come back to it I am missing that \\nsunroof it all feels a bit more claustrophobic despite the fact there are some decent sized back windows \\nanyway enough about car rying people what are these cars like for carrying their stuff both of these cars \\nhave electrically operated tailgates with a handy split fold function and you can lower them on their air \\nsuspension as well to make it easier to load them just just let our little farty sound hopefully there\\'s no \\nfollow through now with seven seats in place this has a slightly larger load capacity 330 liters compared \\nto 210 for that\\'s about 50 larger however when you fold down that third row in both the vehicles you \\nfind out that the Range Rover has the largest capacity 860 liters compared to 750 for the BMW though if \\nyou need in more space you can then fold all the seats down and basically turn these vehicles to Posh \\nluxurious Vans oh my God that\\'s huge no it\\'s not completely  flat and neither is that quiet they\\'re both \\nvery similar though I think overall that has more space because just look how tall it is inside anyway \\nonce you\\'re done you can shut them up like this and it does both the top and bottom part of the tailgate \\nand at that point you notice that the tail lights on the Range Rover are definitely cooler than on the \\nBMW because when the lights aren\\'t on you don\\'t see the tail lights at all they\\'re like blend into the \\nbody see one of the things about this car is that you  just seem to sit higher and have a better view out \\nthan other SUVs now illustrate the difference to the X7 Now using my assistant so I\\'ve got the cars air \\nsuspension in its mid setting so can you measure how high my eyes are off the ground see how raised \\nup I am what you got 158 centimeters right so 158 centimeters in the Range Rover what\\'s it in the BMW \\nI can tell you right away that I feel like I\\'m lower down in the X7 but let\\'s find out the exact number \\ncome on then measure me again we\\'ve got the car wo w tape measure of Truth so what is it saying 149. \\noh 149 that\\'s nine centimeters lower there is one last thing to compare though and that\\'s the engines so \\nboth of these cars are available with petrol or diesel power this is the diesel version of the long \\n\\nwheelbase Range Rover it\\'s a three liter straight six Diesel with 350 horsepower you can also get a 3 liter \\na straight six turbo petrol with 400 horsepower or a 4.4 liter twin turbo V8 with 530 horsepower which \\ninterestingly is an engine from BMW though it \\'s not this 4.4 liter twin turbo V8 in the M60 because \\nthat\\'s actually built by BMW\\'s M Division and they won\\'t give their M engines to Land Rover other \\nchoices are a three liter straight six turbo petrol with 381 horsepower or a three liter straight six D iesel \\nwith 352 horsepower both these cars have eight -speed automatic gearboxes an all -wheel drive so now \\nshall we see how they compare out on the road right now let\\'s see how quick these cars are from door \\nto 60 miles an hour by launching them and how clos e they get to their manufacturer\\'s claim time first \\nup the BMW supposed to do note 60 in 4.7 seconds let\\'s go wow that shot off it\\'s going to be quicker \\n4.0 seconds that is n\\'t the BMW said would it be a similar story with the Range Rover Land Rover says 0  \\nto 60 takes 6.4 seconds but what does asbestos timing gear say let\\'s find out rate boost release here we \\ngo come on what\\'s the number 6.2 seconds not bad for a diesel okay so we still want the acceleration \\nfrom a stencil is like in this Range Rover but wh at\\'s it like when you\\'re driving along at 40 then you meet \\nyour dual carriage or a Motorway you need to get up to 70 miles an hour let\\'s see how it responds and \\nthe gearbox so I\\'m going to floor it here we go a bit of a pause there between me flooring it a nd actually \\ndoing something but now once it\\'s in its stride this diesel has some serious pulling power and when \\nyou\\'re cruising along at speeds it\\'s a very relaxing car to travel in hardly any road noise from those big \\nwheels is surprising little bit of wi nd flutter just here and there but overall very very relaxing I\\'m also a \\nlittle bit more relaxed than you might imagine because I\\'ve got the massage seat on now and I\\'m being \\ngently kneaded yeah nice car to cruise around in this the economy is all right as  well it\\'s not too bad for \\na big thing now we all expect a Range Rover to do well when you\\'re cruising on the motorway but what \\nabout a twisty Road you know this is a big tall heavy vehicle let\\'s find out there we go right that\\'s \\nsurprising it feels like i t\\'s going to topple over but it somehow just grips into the road and goes round \\nnow part of the reason for that is that it comes as standard with active anti -roll bars and it stops it \\nleaning so much in the bends it\\'s quite surprising actually what it can do however it\\'s no sports car it\\'s \\nno sports utility vehicle even it still has a very much like leisurely approach to going down a country road \\npart of the reason for that is the steering it\\'s very very light you\\'re not entirely sure what the front \\nwheels are doing no also it\\'s quite big so when you go past a coach like that it can be a bit scary can\\'t \\nfault the brakes though nice and strong nice and Progressive as well not grubby at all and actually you \\ncan keep up with most cars you can in this thing and then of course the other area where it matters in \\ntown and that\\'s when you really appreciate that race driving position where you can just look down oh \\nhere\\'s another big gate oh my God I said you can look down under the vehicles unless they\\'re a bus or a \\ncoach can\\'t look down on them but everyone else pretty much or maybe a van van drivers also sit \\nhigher in fact don\\'t bother getting a Range Rover just get a van vans also have the same thing as this \\nlook this this kind of armrest which is really nice what Vans don\\'t tend to have though feature that\\'s so \\nimportant on this especially when you\\'re just pottering around town is rear wheel steering as standard \\nso despite being bloody long this car is a turning circle of 11.5 meters which is insanely good just wat ch \\nthis I can turn around in here without curbing those massive alloy wheels and look I can use this bird\\'s \\neye view to make sure that I don\\'t it\\'s so maneuverable actually more maneuverable than that Honda \\nCivic in front this car is going to take some bea ting is the BMW X7 up to the task Ryan X7 let\\'s see what \\nyou got sign off with pickup from 40 miles an hour when you come to a dual carriageway or motorized \\nI\\'m going to floor it once again the pause is the gearbox decides what to do but now I\\'ve only been  in \\nthe power there\\'s four point four liter twin turbo V8 it absolutely took off and sounded pretty awesome \\nas well though I think some of that noise is played to the speaker speak of which I think this car is \\nslightly quieter than the Range Rover ever so slightly I\\'m not getting any tire noise at all once again \\namazing considering the size of the wheels but there seems to be a little less flutter of wind I bet the \\neconomy is not as good as the road driver though now it\\'s 18 miles to the gallon that\\'s the p rice you pay \\nfor that twin turbo V8 I\\'m sure this car can pull things back on twisty road so let\\'s try it put in sport like \\nwith the Range Rover we\\'ve got active anti -roll bars to stop it leaning but they\\'re an optional on most X7 \\nso you do get them as sta ndard on this M60 version this car feels way more sporty than the Range \\nRover it\\'s really quite incredible how it manages to be pretty much as comfortable as you\\'re just floating \\nover bumps in some ways it\\'s actually better at dealing with bumps in the Ran ge Rover yet at the same \\n\\ntime it\\'s more tied down it doesn\\'t feel quite so wallowy it\\'s more precise and the steering is definitely \\njust feels more connected to the road than the Range Rover gives you more confidence to go quickly \\ndoesn\\'t feel quite as wide either I\\'m not so nervo us of getting closer to the vehicles I don\\'t know why \\nthat is one thing I am missing though is that race driving position I mean obviously it\\'s raised up in this \\nbut you do notice the difference with the Range Rover you just feel a little bit more Superior  I\\'m also \\nmissing the armrest and special armrest on the seat damn it there\\'s another thing I miss with this car \\nand that\\'s the Turning circle of the Range Rover this still has rear wheel steering once again it\\'s an \\noptional most acceptance but the M60 get s it as standard however despite having rear wheel steering \\nthe Turning circle is still almost a meter more than the long wheelbase Range Rover so I have to be \\nmore careful here come on maybe we can still make it yeah it still made it it\\'s 12.4 meters stil l I do like \\nthis car overall it\\'s just a great balance of comfort and handling it\\'s amazing what BMW have achieved \\nwith it sort of does it all [Music] so then what\\'s my final verdict well these cars are both very closely \\nmatched and really this Range Rover  there\\'s something special about it makes you just want it however \\nI\\'ve got to be objective and really in many ways the BMW is actually the better car it\\'s Superior \\ndynamically on -road because that top really matters most people won\\'t ever take these cars off-roading \\nalso it\\'s got better build quality and it\\'s better value for money as well and that\\'s why overall it wins this \\ntest anyway I hope you\\'ll enjoyed the video if you did give it a like let me know if you\\'re good with my \\nbut it\\'s in the comments bel ow click on those windows there for some more videos and on that box \\nthere to get a car wow to change your car not only can you buy your next car through car out you can \\nalso sell your current car through us as well it\\'s dead easy  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW X7  \\nReview:  \\nhey everyone and welcome back to the channel so today i\\'m down at hendrick bmw northlake we\\'re \\ngoing to take a look at one of their 2022 bmw x7 xdrive40is so huge shout out to them for providing this \\nmassive suv for me today make sure you guys check out th eir website all that info is down in the \\ndescription the x7 that you see behind me is finished off in mineral white metallic with an msrp just \\nunder 90 000. and to start off today\\'s review we\\'re going to take a look at what powers this x7 \\nunderneath the ho od is the three liter inline six cylinder twin power turbocharged engine paired to the \\neight -speed steptronic automatic transmission and it pumps out 335 horsepower around 5500 rpm and \\n330 pound -feet of torque as low as 1500 rpm that power sent through the  x-drive all -wheel drive \\nsystem this weighs in right around 5 300 pounds it\\'ll do zero to 60 in five and a half seconds up to its top \\nspeed of 155 miles an hour and it has a fuel capacity of 21.9 gallons you\\'ll expect the fuel economy to be \\n19 miles per ga llon in the city and 24 out on the highway this has a wheelbase of 122.2 inches its overall \\nlength is 203.3 it has a width of 78.7 a height of 71.1 and its ground clearance measures in at 8.7 inches \\nand now as we move on to the exterior styling this one is  pretty much fully loaded so it has a lot of \\nawesome exterior goodies we\\'re going to start off with the massive kidney design for the grill finished \\noff in chrome on this model all the vertical slats are finished off in more of a brushed trim to give it a \\ntwo-tone design this even has active grille shutters just behind those to help improve with better \\naerodynamics there\\'s a nicely incorporated forward -facing camera at the bottom as well as all the \\nparking sensors that run throughout this bumper as well and  then moving on to these led headlights drls \\nand turn signals the headlight housing itself is very sleek going right off the corner of that grille the drls \\nalso have a nice c -shape designed to them underneath the headlights and the high beams with the turn  \\nsignal in the upper section of the housing definitely gives it a great design for this front end and this \\neven has led fog lights at the very lower section of the corners on both sides there\\'s some chrome trim \\nsurrounding those pieces as well just to brea k it up and this even has a forward -facing sensor which is a \\npart of the adaptive cruise and all that technology and there\\'s very clean lines that run down the hood \\nmeeting the top of the grill as well as the top of the headlight housings very nicely and m oving on to the \\nside profile this has the upgraded 22 inch wheels with a multi -spoke design as well as a two -tone finish \\ndefinitely gives it a great luxury look there\\'s a chrome trim piece just behind that leading all the way to \\nthe back doors really nice lines flow down the side profile as well as the fender arches too just giving it a \\n\\ngreat look this has body colored side mirrors with the base of them being finished off in gloss black and \\nit also has a camera as well as the integrated turn signal up on the roof is the full panoramic roof along \\nwith the brush trim for the roof racks it\\'s  even surrounding the window trim too and there\\'s a really \\nclean line just underneath the height of the door handles and making our way to the rear this has a \\nbody colored spoiler with the integrated third brake light gloss plug trim pieces are on both sid es just to \\ntie it nicely with the rear glass the wiper blade is mounted in the lower section to give the driver better \\nvisibility there\\'s a chrome trim piece connecting both of the led tail lights running right through the \\nmiddle of this power liftgate whe re this also has a backup camera right in the middle all the parking \\nsensors are down below as well as the dual exhaust more of that brush trim just to break it up some and \\nthis even has a towing capacity around 5 400 pounds very healthy for the size of th is vehicle making it \\nvery practical to own and then as we move on to the cargo space now you can use the button on the \\nkey fob or i can just use the electronic button up underneath bmw and this does have the split style for \\nthe liftgate so as you can tell the upper one will automatically open up and then from there you can \\npush on this button on the left side and the lower section will automatically go down so if you\\'re \\ntailgating you\\'d like somewhere to sit or you just want your load height to be away from  the bumper so \\nwhen you put items in and out you\\'re not going to risk touching the bumper it\\'s a really cool split style \\ndesign and this is a three row vehicle with the third row currently up there\\'s a good amount of storage \\nspace where you can place items  if you have this packed full of people underneath the floor is even a lot \\nmore storage as well as this removable cover you can store it out of the way if you\\'re not going to use it \\nplenty of room to put even more items and hide them away and then you can also remove this cover \\nand fold the seats down so we\\'re going to start off with the third row seating over on this driver\\'s side if \\ni just hold on both of these buttons the headrests will automatically fold down if they\\'re already up and \\nthen by holding on  these buttons they will fold down giving you a lot more storage in the back if you do \\nhave second row passengers now the two buttons in front of that if i hold on these it will just move the \\nsecond row forward and then you cannot actually fold the second row completely flat you can however \\nmove them out of the way giving you a little bit more space and then if you just want to push on one \\nbutton we have maximum storage and maximum people so if i push on max storage the third row will \\nfold down the second r ow will slide forwards maximum people will bring everything back up and then to \\nclose the lift gates you can push this button on the left side which is the one to open it the one on the \\nright side will actually lower the rear end of this vehicle so like i mentioned earlier with the load height \\nnow you have a much lower load height in order to put items in and out and up top is lock on one side if \\ni push the one on the left side it will close both of them at once so it\\'s nice to have that one button to do \\nboth of those tailgates and now let\\'s work our way to the back seating where you can lock and unlock \\nthe vehicle using this door handle which is great to see and this interior leather is called tarduffo it\\'s a \\nreally nice brown with all the dark stitching th e window control is finished off in brushed aluminum as \\nwell as all the sunshade adjustments which i\\'ll show later the release handle is finished off in brushed \\naluminum this even has the interior ambient lighting package with more brushed aluminum some wo od \\ntrim plenty of storage space in the lower section of the door as well as one of the speakers and now \\nmoving our way to the third row with the second row seating all i need to do is pull on that tab and the \\nseat will automatically make its way forwards g iving me plenty of room to hop into this third row so at \\nfive foot ten i have plenty of space and there are captains chairs for the second row seating so there\\'s a \\nlittle bit of space in between and as you can tell there is plenty of foot room the second r ow also slides \\nforwards and backwards so if you need a little bit more room you can adjust those as needed and i have \\naround an inch or so above my head so it\\'s actually pretty spacious i could be back here and right \\naround town maybe go on a quick trip th e third row passengers even have that ambient lighting as well \\nas an armrest and a cup holder and then a pretty good amount of visibility even with that pillar there \\nyou can easily see out there\\'s some nice alcantara on parts of the headliner it\\'s even cov ering the entire \\nupper section as well there\\'s also climate controls back here so there\\'s air vents as well as having heated \\nseats where you\\'d like there to go temperature controls all of that for your third row even a sunroof so \\nit\\'s great to see that for  your third row passengers there are definitely a lot of amenities now going back \\nto the second row if i put that seat all the way back it will automatically slide back to the position that it \\nwas in so it\\'s great to see that and while it\\'s still moving i\\' m going to go ahead and make my way into \\n\\nthe seat where i have plenty of room the front seat is also adjusting back to where that was so \\neverything will go back to where it was set and i can further slide this seat back to give me a little bit \\nmore leg room and again at 5 foot 10 plenty of room i  have a few inches above my head as well and \\nthese seats are all automatic so you can also recline them and just be a little bit more comfortable in the \\nback of your x7 with your adjustable armrest that you can lock into place which is of course great to s ee \\nand then right in the middle we have the second row seating adjustments for the heated seats all of the \\nother buttons for the ac as well as that small screen there are two air vents along with a little bit of \\nstorage space underneath you could place you r phone or other items and then there\\'s a 12 volt along \\nwith two usbs two cup holders in the floor and x7 is just behind that there\\'s also more charging ports \\nbehind the front seats and an area where you could hook up an attachment to place a tablet so you  \\ncould be in the second row watch a movie or something if you\\'re on a trip there\\'s even some storage \\nbins behind both front seats as well and then like i mentioned earlier over on the door panel are all \\nthese sunshade adjustments the one on the upper left will control this door of course and you can put it \\nup and down the one on the right side will adjust the passenger one so you can quickly put that up and \\ndown on the back left if i push on this one this is actually for the entire sun shade so you can open  and \\nclose that if you\\'d like to from the second row and then the last one you can use this to adjust the one \\nfor the third row passengers so you can be as comfortable as you want in the back seats and just to take \\na look at that interior ambient lighting while we do have some shade it\\'s currently purple it\\'s a really \\nnice touch and before we move on to the front seats this x7 does have remote start so in order to \\nactivate that all i need to do is push on the lock button three times in a row and it will aut omatically \\nstart up which is a really nice feature to have and if you do want to shut it off for whatever reason \\nsimply just triple tap that button again and it will shut off and then from there i can unlock the vehicle \\nthe door handle is just like the rea r one of course so you can use that to lock it and the door panel is \\nfinished off in that same brown leather with all the stitching brushed aluminum all the controls for the \\nside mirror adjustments even the memory seating adjustments you can adjust the pas senger seat being \\nable to move them forwards and backwards this even has massaging seats really nice to see that all the \\nwood trim tons of storage space in the lower section of that door and then moving on to these front \\nseats they have a great design just  like the rest of the seating obviously and all the buttons to control \\nthis seat are down on the side of course and at 5 foot 10 it\\'s very easy to hop into the front seats door \\nsill is very low and then making your way to the steering wheel completely cove red in solid black leather \\nwith black stitching more brushed aluminum this is even a heated steering wheel and then on the left \\nside is all the cruise and adaptive cruise control settings on the right side is volume and tuning as well as \\nbluetooth and voic e commands but let\\'s fire this x7 back up with my foot on the brake that button is \\ndown below and we can bring this back to life and coming back to the stage gauge cluster on the left \\nside is the fuel gauge as well as miles per hour on the right side is th e attack in the engine temperature \\nthe navigation is also being shown right in the middle so it\\'s great to have that and then within the tach \\nyou can go through a lot more information using this button on the top of the turn signal stock so \\ncurrently it\\'s showing the driving mode as well as what gear the vehicle is in if i push on it once we can \\nalso pull up the average mpg you can pull up some data information if you\\'d like to monitor that as well \\nas live readouts for horsepower and torque so if i give the  vehicle some gas those will adjust as needed \\nthere\\'s also the g -force meter that you can look at as well as music this does also feature brushed \\naluminum on the steering wheel mounted paddle shifters so you can use those if you\\'d like to and then \\nover on the left side there\\'s a good amount of storage space down below where you could place any \\nitems if you\\'d like to all the headlights parking lights and fog light adjustments are right there as well as \\na dimmer switch for the gauges more of that brushed alum inum and wood trim this even has the heads -\\nup display so it\\'s showing the speed limit sign as well as the miles per hour and then right in the middle \\nis this massive touch screen system you can go through a lot of information currently this is on the \\nhome screen where it will show up your navigation along with music and phone i can swipe over look at \\nsome more data information as well as the traffic and the compass even pull up the date the news any \\nweather information you\\'d like to look at and then on this  left side is all the presets which are fixed i\\'m \\ngoing to use all the controls to further go through that info so they\\'re shortcuts to a map and navigation \\nas well as home media and phone the rotary dial in a few buttons just underneath that so by using t hat \\n\\nrotary dial on this left side you can see a media and phone if i click on navigation you can pull that up in \\nfull screen to go through all that info going into car now there\\'s a lot more information to go through \\nfrom your driving information you can go in to sport display so if you want to monitor this information in \\nyour x7 you can which is kind of cool to see going into xview now you can pull up the suspension level as \\nwell as the compass look at your degrees as well as your altitude pretty neat to be abl e to monitor that \\ninformation there\\'s also energy flow as well vehicle status will go through some general information if \\nyou want to monitor any of that and settings has everything that you\\'d like to configure from your \\ninterior ambient lighting your clim ate control you can adjust the remote start if you want to have that \\non or not the different driving modes your driver assistance there is a lot of information to configure \\nyou can also pull up your owner\\'s manual if you\\'d like to and just underneath that there\\'s another \\ninterior ambient lighting strip running just above this wood trim and there\\'s more brushed aluminum \\nsurrounding that there\\'s even a shortcut to the intelligent safety so if we go into this you can configure \\neverything from the forward colli sion the side collision lane departure blind spot steering intervention \\nall that information is quickly accessible and then moving on to more of these controls there\\'s two air \\nvents right in the middle is all the ac controls finished off in brushed aluminu m this has a dual zone \\nsystem so there\\'s temperature and fan speed for driver and passenger this even has heated front seats \\nso those controls are on both sides with more of their recirc and where you\\'d like there to go making \\nyour way below that are all t he presets for the audio as well as power and volume tuning is on that right \\nside and at the very bottom is a wireless charging pad on the back side along with a 12 -volt and a usb \\nthere\\'s two cup holders you can even chill these as well or heat them depend ing on the drink that you \\nhave really cool to see that if i close this up there\\'s even more wood trim more brushed aluminum and \\nthat interior ambient lighting strip even adjustment for the suspension for the ride height so i can push \\non that raise this veh icle all the way up and you will see you can get a little bit more ground clearance as \\nwell if you need it there\\'s a downhill assist control as well as the electronic parking brake and then over \\non this left side are all the different driving modes so if i  click on this once we have sport and sport \\nindividual the one underneath it is comfort you will see the gauge cluster change there\\'s even eco pro \\nand eco pro individual and the last one is the adaptive mode so just depending on how you want the \\nvehicle to  drive it will automatically adapt to the conditions and then also over on this left side is \\ntraction control parking sensors can be turned on and off and then there\\'s even a shortcut to the \\ncamera system so talking about this 3d camera system this is the rear facing camera right now as you \\ncan see it\\'s in full screen if i put the vehicle into reverse now we have the top down view over on the \\nright side with a few shortcuts so you can see around the exterior of this vehicle if i swipe over now we \\nhave the 3 d view you can use your hand with the gesture control or just push on these buttons here and \\nyou can see exactly what\\'s around the entire exterior giving you no visibility issues the last one is the car \\nwash setting or you can use this when you\\'re pulling into a parking space to give you that top -down \\nview if you need it this even has the automatic parking so it will help you in parallel parking and the \\nbackup assistance with this shifter too it\\'s finished off in crystal which is a really nice touch park is  also \\non the back side if i go down into drive and pop it over into the manual setting that\\'s how you can shift \\nusing this or the steering wheel mounted paddle shifters as needed and then just behind that we have \\nthe armrest i can open up that split design  just by pushing on that button there\\'s a usbc so you can \\ncharge electronics in there if needed and over on the glove box side plenty of room for all of that \\ninformation we\\'ll take one last look at this interior very beautiful spec for this x7 and up top w e have \\nthat sunroof so i can easily open that up this even has some technology in the sunroof itself so it can \\ndim to take some of that lighting out just to protect you a little bit more up top there\\'s even the dome \\nlights and we can adjust some of the oth er sunshades as well so as we get behind the wheel of this 2022 \\na bmw x7 now this is a very ultra luxurious jumbo suv that has so much to offer for all of your \\npassengers there\\'s a lot of amenities even all the controls for your third row passengers makes it \\nenjoyable to be all the way in the back which is great to see this has the massaging seats which i didn\\'t \\ntalk about too much but if i push on this button i can go through the shoulder lumbar upper body whole \\nbody go through different levels you can be comfortable while you\\'re driving this around along with that \\nadaptive suspension just to give you the ultimate driving machine and make it very comfortable at the \\nsame time now with that being said i can pop it over into the manual setting i need to shut o ff the \\n\\nmassaging seats there we\\'ll give it some gas in third gear and not only are the paddles incredibly \\nresponsive for the size of this vehicle it will get up and move now that was a light acceleration as we \\ncome around this turn just going at a normal rate of speed i mean it handles its weight well i love how \\nbmws drive especially with the top dog here the x7 handles well just going at a normal speed it\\'s not a \\nperformance oriented vehicle however you can get some higher trim levels if you want a little bit mor e \\nperformance and now as we switch over to the pov angle you can see what it\\'s like to be behind the \\nwheel of this x7 and how luxurious it is from the driver\\'s seat so i currently have it in the normal setting \\nwe are still in comfort mode and like i mentio ned it is so nice to drive very smooth and as far as visibility \\ngoes looking over this right shoulder i can see all the way to the back even like i mentioned earlier with \\nthat pillar it\\'s not really all that bulky so it is easy to see in all directions and  we have that 3d camera \\nsystem if you need a little bit more visibility and then giving it an acceleration from first just a mild \\nacceleration and there are no power issues this can definitely handle its weight with the amount of \\npower that it has to offer  and talking about the adaptive crews while we have some vehicles in front of \\nus i can quickly set it i can also push on the mode button so we can go between the distance control as \\nwell as the assisted driving which is currently on and now the distance co ntrol just by using plus and \\nminus i can control how close i want to be to the vehicles i can also monitor my speed and then with the \\nassisted driving it\\'s going to take this turn for me now i will say with the assisted driving it\\'s not going to \\ntake very tight corners so obviously you need to have your hands on the wheel and paying attention it\\'s \\nmainly for being out on the highway just to keep you in your lane and centered but it\\'s still a \\nphenomenal system this is the full adaptive cruise as well so if t he traffic in front of me came to a stop \\nthis vehicle would come to a complete stop and then proceed as the traffic started moving but that\\'s \\ngoing to wrap it up for this 2022 a bmw x7 xdrive40i once again huge shout out to hendrickbmw \\nnorthlake for provid ing this massive suv for me today make sure you check out their website that link is \\ndown in the description give the video a huge thumbs up if you enjoyed it and consider smashing that \\nsubscribe button so you don\\'t miss out on our daily uploads i will see  you all in the next video [Music] \\nyou \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW X7  \\nReview:  \\n[Music] hey guys what\\'s up it\\'s joe radio from radius rise i\\'m back here at bmw of tampa and guess what \\nwe have that full -size performance suv standing right next to me this is it this is a 2022 bmw x7 m50i but \\nbefore we get into this super sized super pow erful suv let\\'s talk about what\\'s going on here bmw they\\'ve \\nbeen doing the business in the auto industry since 1933 if you could believe that but before that they \\nmade motorcycles and airplanes and airplane engines but since 1933 really laid down the road work for \\nmaking an iconic brand now obviously it\\'s always been about bmw sedans bmw coupes and sports cars \\nso many championships they even dabbled in formula one but you know what 21st century what really \\nsells and sells in a big way are suvs and bmw decid ed to enter that full -size suv segment now the x7 has \\nbeen around for a few years there\\'s been some mild changes here and there but is this the luxury suv to \\nbuy over some of the longer staying mainstays in this segment ideally the lincoln navigator and th e \\ncadillac escalade so i want to get into this m50i talk about its performance talk about what it brings to \\nthe luxury table but find out is it the better luxury suv than the mighty cadillac escalade let\\'s go ahead \\ndive in and find out what our 2022 x7 rig ht off the bat the style even though this is super size you\\'re \\ngetting that traditional bmw style now at the front of the business you\\'ll notice good size on the \\nheadlight housing but nothing too obnoxious on the interior getting those bmw laser lights wat ch out \\nthey might zap you i love the daytime running lamps especially the way they did that signature halo \\ndesign and then of course you\\'re going to get the turn signals as well dropping down i hope you like \\nfunctionality because you\\'re getting massive cor ner openings that are going to bring nice cool air into \\nthe heat exchangers and a side air curtain and you have full led fog lamps love this satin steel finish look \\nthat they have around the air curtain a little bit of gloss black but nothing too crazy and  bmw always \\ndoes a great job no matter what the vehicle on how they extend that lower front fascia so that there\\'s \\nnot a bunch of stuck on appendages to increase aerodynamic efficiency now as we climb across that \\n\\nmassive grill even though this is a massive suv i really feel like the grills on the 3 series like the m3 and \\nthe m4 are larger than this vehicle but that kidney shape fits it pretty well you do have a forward -facing \\ncamera which is a nice touch and like i  said the satin steel finish with the vertical slots you do have \\nactive arrow that\\'s going to open and close and i\\'ve always liked how they do the hood design and it \\nkind of just comes to a nice point there now dropping down you do have some gloss black lo oks good \\nbrand new not sure how it\\'s going to look down the road but you have more functionality and i like the \\nway they took this lower lip and it extended down another little design feature i\\'ve always liked about \\nbmws is this lower grill area is almost like separate from the rest of the front fascia really gives it a nice \\nidentity now when you get up onto that massive hood what do we got a massive bmw badging flavor \\nflay would be proud to hang this around his neck instead of that clock that\\'s how large i t is but you do \\nhave those clean german lines everything going right towards the windshield we come around the bend \\nwhat are we working with wheel and tire setup just like this suv is big we got some big wheels and tires \\nwhat are we looking at these are 22 -inch wheels so 22 -inch wheel love the machined aluminum that \\ngunmetal metallic gray the bmw badge in the center look at those calipers they\\'re the size of ice skates \\nthat\\'s how large those calipers are nice metallic blue with the m badge now this is not a  true m vehicle \\nbut being an m50i it does bring extra performance not only underneath the hood but also when it \\ncomes to braking capability massive rotors the size of a super -sized pumpkin with those rotors fully \\nventilated and we have air suspension that\\' s also going to help with the overall ride quality and handling \\nadaptive dampers all four corners this is technology learned from the race tracks and brought to your \\nstreet going vehicles like this x7 love the way they paint that beautiful pearlescent whit e all the way \\naround the fender opening and as we come around you do have this side fender vent my only zonk is it\\'s \\nnot functional but i do like the way they flare out that satin steel look and look at the body line how it \\njust drops down and goes along t he bottom of the door with that trim all the way back almost looks like \\na big hockey stick but anyways that really helps with the style from the side nice satin steel look on your \\nmirror caps you\\'re gonna have 360 degree cameras the good news about this su v it\\'s not as large as an \\nescalade and i kind of like that and i really like some of the nice curves that this has compared to the \\nmore blocky transformer design of a robot that the escalade is now up top we do have these gloss black \\nraised roof rails glos s black around the trim both top and bottom color match mirror caps and you can \\nsee those body lines really shows motion even though there\\'s no motion here now the great news is \\nlooking at the back with these rear tires you\\'re looking at 315 315 on the wid th of these rear tires that\\'s \\nas wide as my shelby gt350rs rear tires and you\\'re still going to get substantial brakes in the back and \\nlike i said that x drive on an x7 you got x drive get the power to the ground all four wheels coming \\naround the back what  do we got we got a nice simple clean design i wish it had a little bit longer roof \\nspoiler just something that kind of extended out a little bit more that way we would be able to get rid of \\nthis rear wiper because that would just really make the back supe r sexy but i love the m badge like i said \\nnot a true m car but you are getting more performance m50i there\\'s that satin steel look with the x7 \\nbadge and then dropping it like it\\'s hot all the way to the bottom nice sim simple simulated rear diffuser \\nyou do  have those massive exhaust outlets and guess what they\\'re actually hiding dual pipes not just \\nsingle pipes so you have quad pipes two pipes on each end on each side and then you\\'ve got the \\ndecorative trim ring but while we go ahead we\\'re talking about pow er let\\'s pop the hood and see what\\'s \\npowering this except guys we got the hook popped you do have hydraulic hood struts now what\\'s \\ninteresting comparing this to the escalade the escalade does have a v8 you can get that 6.2 liter with \\n426 horsepower but gue ss what we have a v8 under here but things are a little different check it out \\nsexy engine compartment you can see all the bracing that they have and i\\'m telling you right now that \\nengine cover is just doing things to me in a very very good way love the m performance badge love that \\nbmw logo but what we\\'re looking at underneath that plastic cover you\\'re looking at a twin turbo v8 so \\n4.4 liter twin turbo v8 523 horsepower 553 pound -feet of torque it is mated to a zf 8 -speed automatic \\ntransmission 0 -60 in 4.5  seconds with that all -wheel drive obviously gonna have that quicker \\nperformance than the escalade the vehicle weighs 5 700 pounds mpgs 15 in the city 21 on the highway \\nand this is the nice thing is that if you want your naturally aspirated power you could  go that route with \\nan escalade if you go this route though with the m50i you\\'re getting smaller displacement but the \\naddition of twin turbos but while we go ahead let\\'s fire up this m50i and hear what it sounds like \\n\\n[Applause] all right guys here we are in this 2022 bmw x7 m50i i know you\\'re seeing yourself well joe \\ni\\'ve been looking at your full -size suvs i\\'ve been really focusing in on the two like you said escalade and \\nnavigator i thought about the grand wagoneer b ut i\\'m gonna pass on that one but i am liking the style \\nand the performance of this x7 m50i how much is it so msrp for the way that this one is optioned is right \\naround 105 695 let\\'s see what you get for the money to the door panel so you have two tone mat erial \\nnice dark tan with the black i love the soft top touch up top you do have two memory seat settings \\nwhich are great and you also have massage seat settings which are even better harman kardon sound \\nsystem a little bit of wood finish and then if you lo ok closely with that silver trim there\\'s that ambient \\nlighting that\\'s going to shine through that you could change every which way from roy g biv door pocket \\nis very large very unique shape though so maybe when you go to jimmy john\\'s you\\'re gonna have to b e \\ncreative with what size subs you put in there but you should at least be able to put two jimmy john subs \\nin there and a bottle of surge or jolt cola to wash it all down now going from the door panel to the dash \\nsame high luxury feel look at the stitch wo rk soft touch material more of that nice open pour wood and \\nambient lighting and it all flows nicely right into this guy right here what are we looking at we\\'re looking \\nat a 12.3 inch digital display for your infotainment it\\'s got apple carplay android aut o navigation it\\'s got \\nobviously the hand gesturing movements that you could do to make adjust adjustments touch screen of \\ncourse you go right to home you can go into your car settings and what\\'s awesome is that they actually \\nhave a white m50i there\\'s those  functional massive vents on both sides let me show you also you could \\nchange the mode so this is comfort nice balance setting we could go into sport my favorite part is watch \\nthis sport plus race track time that\\'s going to give us the most performance and  you can also like i said \\nyou adjust all of the parameters of suspension the whole nine yards you go into vehicle status we could \\ncheck tire pressure engine oil all that good stuff we got the aok it\\'s green just like the incredible hulk \\nand then we\\'re righ t back to where it started so very nicely done i\\'m gonna throw it into reverse super \\nclear on the resolution 360 degree uh camera you got automated parking backup assistance we could \\ngo into camera and just check and make adjustments to contrast the whole nine yards and then get \\nright back to where you started easy peasy look at this you have that tft digital display with your dual \\nclimate temperature readouts of course we\\'re going to have ventilated seats and heated seats slim and \\ntrim on the radio control s more of that open pore wood and ambient lighting and then watch this you \\nready boom wireless charging two cupholders a usb and a place for about 10 atomic fireballs no joke \\nthat\\'s how much you can put in there and then you just close it up one two three look at that this is \\ngoing to control that zf 8 -speed automatic we got of course the idrive controller with the latest software \\nthere are our buttons start stop and assuming star stop of the engine and you have your different \\nmodes which are very nice plus  you can raise and lower your x7 all by the flip of a switch very tastefully \\ndone look at this nice soft you ready for the bombay doors bombs away so what do we got in here you \\ngot some felt lining you could put your iphone 47 not gonna get scratch and a u sb close it up seats \\nleather i wanna thank all the cows out there those german cows thank you look at the beautiful stitch \\nwork nice soft material the bolstering ventilated heated and of course you got all that electric assistance \\nfor the passenger and the  driver and we have that massive massive panoramic sunroof goes all the way \\nback even for the third row passengers but why don\\'t you get your butt over here i want to show you \\nbehind this beautiful m leather wrapped steering wheel and our xz guys we\\'re in this high -end luxury \\nsuv web performance come on into the business end i love the way you\\'re greeted by this very tasteful \\naluminum sill plate with the m50i badge that\\'s gonna light up led at night and then check out the foot \\nbox right out of a bmw race ca r nice large dead pedal brake and throttle all aluminum trim which is \\ngonna be super nice just to look at let alone feel and then you got your seat controls of course you\\'re \\ngonna have two memory seat settings and like i also mentioned they are massage sea ts i got plenty of \\nroom in here and i\\'m wrapped in leather alcantara everywhere even on the headliner and then look at \\nthis steering wheel bmw does a fantastic steering wheel heated wheel of course with the heated wheel \\nbutton right there and then of cours e you\\'re gonna have some nice aluminum finish the m badging thick \\n10 and two notches beautiful stitch work on that horn so much history on that bmw badge paddles \\npretty good size i just wish they were metal so i am going to zonk these they would be nice to  be metal \\nin a 105 000 suv electric tilt and telescoping steering wheel and then you got that 12 inch digital display \\nwith all your information that you need nicely laid out and you have a head up display which is super \\n\\nsized as well but why don\\'t we go ahead we talked about how great it is up here let\\'s get into that mid \\nrow and see how your passengers are going to enjoy this except guys here we are in the mid row and \\nthe great news is your passengers are going to have a  ton of room like i said lots of nice natural light \\ncould be brought in from that massive size panoramic sunroof here\\'s some of the touches you\\'re going \\nto get that i love i think it\\'s so smart the way they have ac vents right in the frame rail for the mid -rope \\npassengers but there\\'s also another set you have soft touch material usb c conveniently placed so you \\ndon\\'t have wires hanging everywhere nice size rear seat pocket large enough to where you could put \\ntwo german size cinnamon rolls back here and if y ou don\\'t know what german size is the reason why i \\npoint that out it\\'s 10 inches in diameter put two of those back there another thing that\\'s super sized is \\ngoing to be this command center rear ac heated seats but no ventilated seats and that to me is a zo nk \\nbut i do like the dual climate control nice easy adjustment you have plenty of room here for about 15 \\ntootsie rolls usb cs on the bottom and a 12 volt i got plenty of leg room over here and another thing i \\nwant to point out is new for 2022 there\\'s some switch gear back here that makes life a little easier on \\nlast year\\'s model i would manually have to lift the security shade not anymore you just push the button \\nit rises up and you have all your switch gear right here i want it to go down watch this goes r ight down i \\ncould even control the sunroof the panoramic sunroof shade which look at that i don\\'t have to bother \\nthe driver easy peasy lemon squeezy i want it back again do it yourself that\\'s what you can tell your kids \\nthey say mom can you open the sun sh ade do it yourself we spent the money we got the extra \\ntechnology speaking of technology good old -fashioned arm rest hard as a old german scone sitting in \\nthe sun but the good news is open it up you got felt lining to put skittles and the great news is you r kids \\ncan look at the rainbow as they taste the rainbow talk about living their best life right open up the cup \\nholder two cup holders oh you gotta have to do that to put it back almost forgot flap that down and \\nthen on top of that instead of manual seats  you actually have electric assist so the buttons are on the \\nside for your passengers behind the driver i have my own buttons here on my side and you can see just \\nhow much movement watch this you ready oh yeah so you could tilt it back we could tilt it up real nice \\nto have that electric cyst assist back when i was a kid you couldn\\'t even move the rear seats you just had \\nto sit there just like you were but let\\'s go ahead let\\'s get in the third row and see how this x7 competes \\nwith the mighty escalade alright  guys where in the world is joe rady from ratey\\'s rides he is in this third \\nrow of the x7 now if you\\'re comparing this to the escalade this is where the escalade is going to win \\nhands down i literally to be able to fit back here had to move this seat all t he way forward and you could \\nsee that yeah i have some room but my knees are too high especially compared to the new escalade \\nwhich has that updated independent rear suspension your rear passenger that third row their knees are \\ngoing to be much much lower the good news is i got plenty of alcantara to make up for it nice and soft \\nand you have your own little sunroof back here that really makes the third row passengers feel really \\nloved at the end of the day one thing that it\\'s going to be hard for lori to sh ow is that i actually have ac \\ncontrols heated seats on the third row no ventilated seats but here\\'s another little fancy feature watch \\nthis you got tie down locations for seats but you also have a usbc underneath this nice lid boom ambient \\nlighting and rea r ac vents so i mean pretty good spoiling of the third row but you\\'re just going to spoil \\nthe person in the escalade a little bit more with room actually fancier back here in the third row than \\nthe escalade but not as much room but let\\'s go ahead let\\'s get  into that cargo area and see what we \\ncould stuff in this exit guys tail on the business obviously very important for people especially going this \\nbig on an suv how much size do you have so you\\'re just going to hit the button nice electric assist raises \\nup this has that split setup so what\\'s nice is that you could put some groceries in and this will hold \\neverything in but if you want to drop the loading platform you just hit that button drops down nicely \\nnow what are we looking at you\\'re looking at around 1 3 cubic feet of space with those rear seats up and \\nif you look on the interior here let me show you what\\'s going on we got all of our switch gear \\nconveniently placed to fold down not only the third row but also the second row you got led lighting on \\nthe pa ssenger side look what we have here you got more led lighting and of course we got a cargo net \\nfor a small box of snickers but let\\'s show you how these seats fold down it\\'s actually quite simple we\\'re \\njust going to push and we\\'re going to wait a couple sec onds look at that right on cue does you love \\nwhen a plan comes together and those are going to fold down very nicely now you fold down that mid \\nrow you\\'ll have 90 cubic feet of space now the good news is you\\'ll have 90 cubic feet of space the bad \\n\\nnews is not as much space as the cadillac escalade cadillac escalade you fold everything down has over a \\nhundred cubic feet of space but while we go ahead i\\'m gonna get this all sorted back here but if you\\'re \\nready i\\'m ready let\\'s go on throttle in our x7 m50i all right guys typical florida weather no matter what \\ntime of the year it could rain at any given notice but you know what that\\'s okay because we got all -\\nwheel drive even though we got all this power and i\\'m ready to merge on the highway on throttle h ere \\nwe go unbelievable just how effectively this thing not only produces power but gets the power to the \\nground very fast shifts faster shifting than the 10 speed in the cadillac escalade and definitely more \\npower even with the twin turbo setup i\\'m actuall y quite impressed with how linear the torque delivery \\nis that\\'s what makes it even more amazing is that you\\'re not waiting for the boost to come in now being \\na bmw especially the x7 you\\'re getting some awesome sounding material the thickness of the acousti c \\nglass all of that is going to create a very serene environment and you\\'re getting just a hint of that v8 roar \\nnothing too crazy a couple pops here and there but that\\'s about it getting to the infotainment system \\nwith the hand gesture movements very easy to do as you can see florida drivers just uh out of control \\nespecially in the in the wet like y -o-y but uh the leather seats are so comfortable especially with \\nmassage head -up display and tons of visibility really really that good guys are thrilled dead st op here we \\ngo not even a hint not even a whimper of traction loss from this x drive system in the x7 m50i and i\\'m \\ntelling you right now you\\'re going to embarrass navigator and escalade owners that are trying to get to \\nfootball practice first because this x 7 it really is a powerhouse yet has all these fine finishes the wood \\nthe technology i guess the only thing that\\'s really hurting are the people in the third row compared to \\nthe competition all right guys we\\'re gonna make a u -turn here show off how simple t hat is just gotta be \\ncareful make sure people are paying attention but easy peasy lemon squeezy on throttle here we go this \\nthing is ridiculous for a vehicle that is big as this one is with the amenities but yet can just fire off the \\nshifts so rocket fast handling is superb even in the wet even in the wet the confidence is there and it just \\nshows how they bring all that technology to the table all that engineering to the table for you so that \\nyou can have really that ultimate driving experience that bmw is known for but going down the highway \\neven over these concrete expansions it\\'s such a smooth complacent ride and really just inspires \\nconfidence it really really does no matter what the weather is doing but hopefully this gave you a nice \\noverall feel about what the x7 m50i brings to the table we\\'re gonna get back to bmw tampa and wrap \\nthis one up so i\\'ll see in a split second hey guys it\\'s been one heck of a day here at bmw tampa i \\ndefinitely got to thank alex and the rest of the team getting us access to th is 2022 bmw x7 on top of that \\nm50i maybe not as much interior room as a cadillac escalade but boy oh boy what\\'s underneath that \\nhood definitely has an advantage let me know what you think are you going bmw style that german \\neuro style with your full -size s uv are you going to go more

let\\'s see what this has whoa hey everyone it\\'s ben hardy here in today\\'s video i\\'ll be reviewing a bmw \\nx7 m50i first and foremost though a huge shout out and thank you to the bmw of pleasant grove utah \\nfor giving me some time with this x7 now something that i absolutely love about the bmw pleasant \\ngrowth is they do not charge any markups on their vehicles which is super rare in the luxury market \\nbecause almost every single luxury dealership is charging massive premiums on their vehicles not here \\nat pleas ant grove so if you\\'re going to buy a new bmw definitely reach out to them i\\'ll include a link to \\ntheir inventory in the description down below and then on a side note if you don\\'t save time and money \\nthe next time you purchase a car link to my carbine gui de in the description down below as well let\\'s get \\n\\ninto the video [Music] so under the hood we have a twin turbo 4.4 liter v8 that goes to an eight -speed \\nautomatic transmission power outputs are 523 horsepower and then 553 pound -feet of torque and i \\nlove how you have the m performance logo with carbon fibe r beautiful display overall and you guys got \\nto remember this is ultimately like a family vehicle with over 500 horsepower it\\'s epic now let\\'s go to \\nthe front end of the x7 so first off you guys can see the bmw logo front and center and then coming \\nhere to  the side you\\'ve got bmw signature headlights here and just look how cool it is with like the blue \\ntrim inside and notice that it says bmw laser there on the side as well and then coming down here you \\ncan see the fog lights we\\'ve got some venting with the parking sensors integrated in the front and then \\nthis we got the signature kidney grill here with a camera there at the bottom and overall this looks really \\ngood actually now popping to the side here we\\'ve got two 75 millimeter tires wrapped around 22 inch  \\nwheels in the front and then 315 millimeter tires wrapped around 22 inch wheels in the back and then if \\nwe look at the wheels from a design perspective you\\'ve got the silver here on the top and you got the \\nmetallic gray below that then you guys can see th e size of the rotors here and you\\'ve got the bmw m \\ncolored blue calipers which again look really cool and then notice here with the fender flare how that\\'s \\nbody painted and then you have this cool like accent piece right here that continues there kind of l ike \\nalong the side and if we take a few steps back they\\'ve kept everything pretty neutral so the wheels pop \\nout but then all the rest of the trim is all blacked out so that everything just matches from a side view \\nperspective so here\\'s our key fob we have our unlock function lock function and the opening here for \\nthe hatch so you press that and it\\'ll pop right open and this has my favorite style of hatch it\\'s got a \\ntailgate hatch so notice that we can actually lower the rear end of the vehicle so it makes l oading things \\na little bit easier but you can just press that to lower this down which is pretty cool and got this nice like \\ncloth trim here so you can actually sit on it which is really cool we have the floor mats here in the back \\nand you can see for the third row passengers they actually get really nice a lot of trim to rest their arms \\non and a cup holder as well which is pretty cool and then also got a bunch of controls right here for the \\nuh seats basically to adjust everything and so something that i re commend just to play with if you buy \\nan x7 and then you\\'ll kind of figure out everything and then notice the well storage space underneath \\nthere we got all the floor mats on top of it so it\\'s kind of hard to reach and then when you are done i\\'m \\ngonna see i f you can just press this if it\\'ll do it all yeah look it does it all together that\\'s cool now \\nfinishing things up with the rest of the rear you guys can see the rails there at the top and then notice \\nwe got our m50i badge and i really like the taillights here on the x7 and then of course we got our x7 \\nbadge there parking sensors here at the bottom and we\\'ve got a receiver hitch here and then look at the \\nexhaust tips on either side we\\'ll talk about tone capacity and payload capacity in a moment but there\\'s \\nthe rear now here\\'s the door panel here you guys can see here with the leather trim at the top and then \\ndown below i love the two -tone design we\\'ve got some controls here for like these sunshades for \\nexample window control speakers for the bowers and wilki ns sound system which again i love the \\ndisplay we of course have our m plaque and then look we got pillows on the headrests now i don\\'t know \\nif this actually comes from the factory but this is still very uh nice and plush and then notice here with \\nthe desi gn on the seats i think that is really cool we have power adjustments here for the rear seats and \\nthis is actually to help raise and lower the seats which is kind of cool you have those controls and notice \\nthere\\'s even like look at that it\\'s padded there t hat\\'s crazy and then really nice headliner too we\\'ll talk \\nabout that later but popping inside you can see legroom and then notice we got some charging ports \\nright here we got some behind the seat storage some vents we\\'ve got the climate controls here for t he \\nrear they have a dual zone here in the back heated seats for the rear passengers and then we got some \\nmore charging ports more cup holders really family friendly and then notice we got our armrests which \\nyou can move up and down if you so desire and the n as for the rest of the rear uh with the third row \\nyou can very comfortably fit uh kids back there uh no problem whatsoever adults you can fit them back \\nthere in a pinch but it\\'s not as comfortable and then you can see here with the ambient lighting for t he \\nback passengers which is another cool little feature now here\\'s the door panel at the front again notice \\nwith the leather trim and then down below we\\'ve got all of our window controls right here and then the \\nmirrors to do power fold in and they\\'ve got b lind spot monitoring and then notice we got memory seats \\nright here we have massaging seats as well and you got this for the rear seats there\\'s just so many like \\nseat adjustment controls here in the x7 and then you can see here with the front seats nice pi llows here \\n\\nfor the headrests and then notice the design here perforated as well and then you\\'ve got your \\nadjustments here on the side of the seat and all that notice the pedals look really nice you got the light \\ncontrols here steering wheel is power adjustable and le t\\'s pop in [Music] now here is the steering wheel \\nfor the x7 you can see really nice leather all around and the air bag cover is covered as well so it looks \\nbeautiful get your heated steering wheel control here paddle shifters for that eight -speed automati c got \\nyour turn signal stock windshield wiper stock and then also we have our cruise control with steering \\nassistance as well and yeah overall nice setup now we\\'ve got the full digital gauge cluster here notice \\nyou got the speed there on the one side and t hen you got the rpms on the other side and of course they \\nremind you that you have the m50i version of the x7 now we do have some different drive modes so \\nwe\\'ve got like our adaptive for example and we have our eco pro which notice how changes the gauge \\ncluster comfort and we have our sport plus mode that you can go into and then you have sport \\nindividual as well and they have sport regular so we have a bunch of different sport modes uh basically \\nand yeah overall i think they did a great job with the gauge cluster love how you have like the navigation \\nscreen built in and all that and it\\'s just a cool setup now here\\'s the infotainment system first off the \\nmost important thing is i gotta turn on the massage function we got level three we\\'re gonna do whole \\nbody  exercise and uh yeah we\\'re gonna get off to a fun time so first off popping into reverse you can see \\nthe backup camera which does have trajectory lines they do turn with the steering wheel we\\'ve got a \\nbunch of different camera viewpoints here out of the x 7 which is fantastic uh so it\\'s just really solid \\nsystem overall resolution is fantastic now as for the rest of the infotainment system you can control it \\nwith a dial if you want you\\'ve got like the shortcut bar here on the side you\\'ve got the main screen right \\nhere a response time if you use it as a touch screen is fantastic it\\'s really easy to use it\\'s actually intuitive \\nand there\\'s so many shortcut buttons here on the side and then also down below i\\'ll show you as well \\nthat it\\'s just it\\'s a great system and so if you like having analog buttons but then also touch screen \\nbuttons then this has it all for you speaking of shortcut buttons we have this for the safety tech you got \\nthe hazard lights and then we have our climate controls right here i just have ev erything synchronized \\nwhich you can access via the menu button and then you can go through the climate menu cooled seats \\nheated seats as well it\\'s all in the same button which is uh pretty cool ah see what i did there and then \\nwe\\'ve got our analog controls  here for like the radio stuff and uh you\\'ve got the presets which if i just \\nhover my finger over the presets it actually goes over and this does have bmw\\'s gesture control where i \\ncan do the volume with my finger if i want which is another cool feature an d then if we press this tab \\nhere it\\'ll open up and it\\'ll show us our wireless phone charger got some storage space in here as well \\nand then we\\'ve got some cup holders right here which notice that you can actually cool the cup holders \\nwhich is also cool i a m just full of uh dad jokes today i suppose when you\\'re done you can just cover that \\nup like that now this is that analog control is telling you for the infotainment system it\\'s this cool crystal \\nshifter and then you\\'ve got all the shortcut buttons around it we\\'ve got the suspension to raise and \\nlower it right here via this function we\\'ve got hill descent control as well we\\'ve got our parking brake \\nwe\\'ve got our auto hold all of our drive modes here in this area nice crystal shifter here and does have a \\nman ual shift function and then look at the engine stop start button and then got your auto stop start \\nhere your parking sensors that\\'s for the camera the stability control and i just love how this looks very \\nhigh end but going from that to the center console area you can see a pretty normal center console \\nsetup a nice leather here on top of it and then notice with the dash again just completely covered in \\nleather so again has that luxury car feel to it and then you can see here with the glove box set up on it \\nand the handle on the glove box is very nice and i just love how this interior looks again with the two -\\ntone design it\\'s just really really cool but popping here to the top we do have a full panoramic center as \\nyou can see premium headliner as well control  for the center if it\\'s just right here in the center and \\nagain just material used throughout is top notch now if you want the most update price on this \\nparticular x7 just check out bmw of pleasant grove\\'s website in the description down below let\\'s take i t \\nout and see how it drives well before we talk about visibility let\\'s quickly talk about the payload and \\ntowing capacity uh so we have almost 1500 pounds of payload capacity and we have almost 6 000 \\npounds of towing capacity so super solid there\\'s visibil ity of the hood you guys can see the heads up \\ndisplay both the mirrors they do have blind spot monitoring and then throughout the rest of the rear \\nand let\\'s set off so setting off in the x7 m50i this is such a cool vehicle if you ask me because again \\n\\nultimately this is a third rest should be it\\'s a family vehicle but man does this have some flare it looks \\nreally cool and on top of looking really cool it\\'s i mean you guys heard the exhaust clip this thing sounds \\namazing again you don\\'t expect to hear th ose noises to come from a family vehicle and we\\'re gonna of \\ncourse pop on our massage seat function got the upside down sign i guess that means you have to cross \\nlike a go across but you have to do it on your head you can\\'t do it with your feet i think i t hink that\\'s \\nwhat that says so if you guys do that crosswalk uh without doing a handstand then you\\'re breaking the \\nwall um but anyways back to the x7 the seats are really comfortable in this bmw did a really so like solid \\njob with these seats um bolstering is wide so if you\\'re a bigger person you\\'ll be able to fit in the seats \\nthey\\'ve got really good padding and again the massage seat function is just like the icing on the cake and \\nthere\\'s so much adjustment with these seats too that like there\\'s you know ju st something for everyone \\nlike you will for sure be able to find like a set up with these seats that just works for you now ride quality \\nand road noise we\\'re not going super fast so i comment just a little bit on road noise it seems like it\\'s \\npretty well i nsulated and the ride quality is very smooth that\\'s something that i\\'ve noticed with bmw\\'s \\nnewer vehicles uh that are on their like newer platforms is they just are all so smooth whether it\\'s a full -\\nblown m car or something like this that you know was like  it\\'s still got em in the name but it\\'s more of \\nlike on the luxury side of things it\\'s still really smooth and look how it just took that big bump right uh \\njust anything and coming down here too it\\'s just like like i mean you feel it but it\\'s it\\'s really n ot it\\'s like \\nit\\'s comfortable it\\'s the best way to put it so i think that bmw\\'s done a great job with this you know from \\na luxury daily driver uh perspective hey so let\\'s see what this has now this is a family car i can get behind \\nthat is just in the manua l mode it\\'s pretty it\\'s pretty cool yeah this is a family car i can get behind look at \\nthat even in the sport plus setting the suspension\\'s super compliant this thing is fun wow it sounds great \\nit\\'s quick i mean that is quick so you know like if you got to  get the kids to soccer practice really really \\nquick like this this will do it won\\'t have to worry about being late to anything with this thing um yeah \\nlet\\'s let\\'s sum things up i\\'m gonna put it back into the comfort setting balance settings what it descri bes \\ncomfort as uh so first off i think the x7 looks great sometimes third row suvs just look ugly frankly \\nbecause they like it it\\'s just like they take like most manufacturers will take like the styling they have on \\nlike a you know smaller suv and they jus t stretch it out and it just doesn\\'t quite look right bmw\\'s made \\nthis work with the x7 it looks really good interior full -on luxury car it\\'s just really nice materials \\neverywhere and the seats are comfortable it\\'s got massaging seats heated cool seats i me an what more \\ncould you ask for frankly so they\\'ve done an amazing job with the interior and then from a driving \\nperspective it does luxury car stuff um and sound system\\'s amazing too on this so that\\'s another big plus \\nthat is fast and it\\'s fun like it just  ticks all the boxes so you know if you um want to do some fun spirited \\ndriving while you got the kiddos in the back you can do that with the x7 it\\'ll let you do that yeah this is \\nthis is definitely a cool suv there you go that\\'s going to something\\'s up fo r our video on this bmw x7 \\nm50i again a huge shout out thank you to the bmw of pleasant girl for giving me some time with this x7 \\ncheck out the inventory in the description down below i\\'ll see all of you in that next video  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW X7  \\nReview:  \\n[Music] hello everyone nick cordellini here with bill jacobs bmw in naperville here today to show you \\nthis 2022 bmw x7 4.0 i this vehicle does come equipped with bmw x -drive\\'s all -wheel drive system \\nunderneath the hood we do have a twin power turbo in -line six-cylinder motor producing 335 \\nhorsepower this engine offers plenty of torque as well as horsepower to get the vehicle moving and get \\nyou up and going let\\'s go ahead and take a look around the vehicle and see what other features this x7 \\nhas alright guys  starting off looking at the wheels of this bmw x7 these are the standard wheels for this \\nvehicle these are 20 in 21 inch wheel option wrapped in all season tires right behind that we do have a \\nlarger brake caliper ensuring that the bmw x7 additional weigh t will make sure that it stops on a dime \\neverything is a squared setup to ensure that the all -wheel drive system has no sorts of issues when it is \\ngoing down the road going around to the rear of the vehicle the x7 much like its predecessor the bmw \\nx5 does offer a split tailgate what the split tailgate allows you to do is simply allows more and easier \\naccess to the rear load floor by offering a lower entry point into the rear cargo area there is an \\n\\nadditional button located right here that will actually even allow you to lower the vehicle to add even \\nheavier items into the rear of the x7 now everyone wonders how does the x7 lower itself the x7 is a \\nstandard four corner air suspension which is exclusi ve specifically to this vehicle being one of the only \\nbmw vehicles that comes standard with four axle air suspension also equipped on this vehicle we do \\nhave a tow hitch the tow hitch would allow the vehicle to tow upwards of 7 500 pounds of towing \\ncapacit y so those boats jet skis or snowmobiles you\\'re looking to take with you on that weekend trip the \\nbmw can bring them right along with you welcome inside the x7 now we\\'re going to take a look at the \\nrear seating surface which is what the x7 is truly most kn own for the reason for this it is the only bmw \\ncurrently to come standard with a third row full seating surface to access the third row area simply push \\nthe button located on the side one single click the front seat will move forward and the entire second \\nrow seating surface will unlatch allowing access to the rear seating compartment in the rear the x7 does \\nhave heated third row seating surfaces usb type -c chargers which are located directly below the cover \\nright here as well as ample room for two adults o r two children whoever decides to crawl back in the \\nrear once everyone is back simply pushing the button to the rear will then lower the seating surface and \\nlock the second row back into place for safety reasons you\\'ll notice on the inside of the second ro w area \\nas well passengers do have the option to move that seating surface forward as well as slightly recline \\nthe rear the rear part portion of the second row area as well the second row also is heated which is the \\nsame as the third row and the first row a rea and lastly rounding out these the second row area is the \\ntravel inconvenience package traveling convenience package the door simply slides to the right hand \\nside allowing bmw approved accessories to be snapped into the rear this would include coat hang ers \\nbag holders as well as rear tray tables for more information visit bmwsa.com or visit bill jacobs bmw \\nboutique located right behind this vehicle that we\\'re in right now in the front seat of the vehicle much \\nlike every other bmw everything is laid out i n a beautiful fashion you have your idrive control system \\nlocated right here which would include your media communication and navigation infotainment \\ninformation your climate control system located dead center and then your radio preset buttons located \\non the lower portion of the vehicle rounding out the dash would be your beautiful 12.2 inch display \\nwhich gives you information from media to vehicle status all the way up to your mapping system for \\nyour navigation system just in just a second here guys we\\'re  going to dive in a little bit more into the \\nidrive system as well as the advanced driver safety systems that make the x7 truly light years above \\neverything else now we\\'re going to focus our attention exclusively upon the bmw i drive system bmw i \\ndrive sys tem operating version number seven allows the driver an exclusive interaction between you \\nand your vehicle one of the easiest ways and most efficient ways of utilizing the car is through your \\nbmw natural voice recognition voice command systems the voice co mmand system can be operated in \\ntwo different ways you do have your voice command button located on the right lower hand portion of \\nyour steering wheel or even better what if you can just tell the vehicle what you want to say hello bmw \\nnavigate to build ja cob\\'s bmw perfect our next destination is bill jacobs bmw bill jacobs mini just simply \\nby telling the vehicle where you want to go your hands can stay on the wheel eye is focused on the road \\nand you\\'re ready to go moving on from the idrive system this butt on located right here is one of the \\nmost commonly asked questions what does it do all of our bmw vehicles now come with advanced \\ndriver safety assist systems specifically for collision warning for pedestrian warning blind spot detection \\nand lane departure warning certain vehicles even come with steering intervention steering intervention \\nwould simply correct the steering if the driver for whatever reason either starts drifting over the lane or \\ntries to maneuver over when there is a vehicle in the blind spot  of that car other advanced safety \\noptions would include the optional acc stop and go with active cruise control a very fun feature which \\nwould be our heated and cooled cup holders which are also available on the x7 as well and then of \\ncourse just rounding  everything out as we mentioned earlier your air ride suspension control this can \\nraise and lower the vehicle you\\'re either giving you more ground clearance to get up those steep \\ndriveways or of course in chicago out of your driveway if it snowed about a f oot overnight or if you have \\nmaybe an elderly individual coming into your vehicle you can then lower the vehicle for easier access \\ninto the car all right guys thank you very much for watching if you guys have any further questions \\nplease feel free to conta ct us at bill jacobs bmw in april illinois

\\nReview:  \\nhey everyone welcome to the channel my name is steven and today i have one of my favorite cars here \\nwith me this is the 2021 bmw x7 x drive 40i i\\'m here in sunny daytona beach florida you\\'d see i\\'ve got \\nthis beautiful beach behind me here unfortunately the  tide is actually too high right now so i can\\'t \\nactually drive it on the beach but uh the nice attendant lady over there let me park it as close as i could \\nso today\\'s video i\\'ll be going over a quick review of the car go over the exterior interior tech fea tures \\nand give final thoughts on how the driving experience is so for those of you who aren\\'t familiar with \\nbmw\\'s lineup the x7 debuted in the 2019 model year and has since then become their flagship suv this is \\na three -row luxury suv if you\\'re called the bmw x5 is actually also offered in a 3 -0 configuration but this \\nis much larger than that so on the exterior you can see got some nice 21 inch wheels i feel like they\\'re \\nactually one of my favorite parts of the car got some nice running boards on the bottom  to help you get \\ninto the large car um this vehicle comes in right around 203 inches long which actually makes it one of \\nthe shorter entries in this segment as compared to rivals like the lincoln navigator cadillac escalade \\nwhich are significantly larger a round 210 inches for those starting with the front fascia of the car you \\ncan see we\\'ve got some gorgeous daytime running lights actually one of my favorite parts of the car as \\nwell i feel like these lights look so much better than some other bmw products t he lower front fascia \\nyou see we\\'ve got a lot of vents here and of course the infamous huge kidney grill on this bmw x7 again \\n21 inch wheels here these are for the base trim the x drive 40i but we do have some upgraded wheels \\nthat you can get on the higher  up models the back of the car i feel like is is not as exciting pretty typical \\nboxy look for the three row suv segment um but it definitely looks good i feel like the the tail lights i i \\nwish they did the full led light bar thing that a lot of other rival s are doing like the porsche cayenne and \\nof course the navigator so going underneath the hood you\\'ve got a turbocharged three liter inline six \\nmakes 300 335 horsepower and 331 pound -feet of torque those numbers aren\\'t the highest honestly in \\nthe segment th e lincoln navigator as well like 400 something but of course this is smaller than that um \\nand this is very similar to the gls which i believe makes a little over 350 horsepower so a little higher \\nthan that but this car does feel really torquey when it driv es um we can kind of go over to that in the \\ndriving part of this review but um yeah the engine is great doesn\\'t make the crazy sounds that you \\nwould expect from you know a sports car or anything but super smooth and in the 2021 model year it \\nactually comes  with a mild hybrid system which assists in the start stop feature which actually feels \\nsuper smooth in this car one of the best i\\'ve ever felt i actually usually turn off auto start install because \\ni don\\'t like how it you know kicks in the engine and stuf f like that but with the mild hybrid system here \\nit\\'s smooth it\\'s super smooth and that\\'s one of my favorite features in the car so far so here\\'s a quick \\ndemonstration of the welcome lights in the car as i approach the car the taillights flash to life and you\\'ve \\ngot the beautiful welcome carpet on the floor as well as illuminated door handles you can also see that \\nthe ambient lighting appears in the car here you can check out how much cargo space we have with the \\nthird row seats up so you can see really not  that much it is kind of nice that the lower lift gate kind of \\ncomes out like this you can sit on it it\\'s actually lined with felt which makes it feel very very expensive \\num but yeah so you\\'ve got my one carry -on baggage right here to already um you do hav e some really \\ncool controls back here though you can actually put down every seat from the back here in the \\nbackground and what my favorite feature is these max things so this is max passenger which means all \\nthe seats go up and then max uh i guess luggage  would make all the seats go down which is super cool \\nand obviously you get more space when all the seats are down here you\\'ve got the pretty standard kick \\nfeature to close or open i\\'m gonna see if i can get it to work right here i\\'m not sure if you can re ally see \\nthis oh there it goes now pretty cool pretty nifty little trick there stepping into the interior of the bmw \\nx7 first thing a lot of people will notice just how quiet the car is once you get in can\\'t hear the wind the \\nbeach the tide at all you can only see it though with these great windows and this huge panoramic \\nsunroof which does come standard on the base trim you\\'ve also got some very large and very high \\n\\nquality 12.3 inch displays you\\'ve got the digital gauge cluster right here and a touch screen here as well \\nthat you can also control with this rotary dial which is fairly convenient i know a lot of people are \\ncomplaining about how everything is going touch  screen these days but this dial is really really nice \\nworks very very well very responsive you\\'ve got two cup holders you can see i\\'ve got my starbucks drink \\nand a huge really really huge voss glass of water got some storage right here as well you can see  i put \\nmy sunglasses there because there is actually no sunglass compartment here which is probably one of \\nmy biggest pet peeves of recent cars i feel like i see less and less sunglass compartments there is a \\nwireless charging tray right here as well you\\'v e got a really gorgeous steering wheel here feels really \\ngood the heated steering wheel button is right here very easy to find the controls are super simple \\nyou\\'ve got cruise control on the left -hand side and you\\'ve got all of your other controls on the ri ght for \\nmedia the interior of this car is a very very nice kind of brownish i feel like it looks really good especially \\nwith the white exterior you can see i\\'ve actually got the third row seats up right now and the middle row \\nis not the captain\\'s formation  which you can get um i believe it\\'s like an 800 up charge or something like \\nthat so going into the second row of this three row suv like i just mentioned you can get it in the \\ncaptain\\'s chair configurations instead of the bench configuration here i would highly recommend getting \\nthe captain sure configuration if you do have people who will be utilizing that third row as it\\'s not easy \\nto get there so let me demonstrate really quickly you have these nice buttons they work well but look \\nhow slowly this moves it\\'s really taken its sweet time and yeah you can get into the third row now but \\nit\\'s definitely pretty slow and you would have to do the same thing to get out as well so getting into the \\nthird row it\\'s not bad it really has a decent leg room i guess you k now obviously i\\'m about five foot eight \\nhere and i\\'m still kind of struggling um but you know it\\'s comfortable back here i do feel like the leather \\nstill feels really high quality you\\'ve actually got ambient lighting back here as well which is super cool u m \\neven got some wood trim here which i feel like makes you feel like you\\'re still in a luxury car you\\'ve got \\nsome nice cup holders you\\'ve even got some um usb ports and everything back here so definitely not a \\nbad place to be it\\'s kind of funny being back here it feels like you\\'re super far away from the the driver\\'s \\nseat i can show you just putting it back in its place pretty simple just click that button it\\'ll do everything \\nfor you it actually even moves the front passenger seat for you as well a little b it to make space for \\neverything yep basically locks back into place and slowly moves back to where it was originally one of \\nmy favorite parts of the second row seats here is that you actually have power controls not as many way \\nadjustable i think the front  are 14 way adjustable but still pretty good for passengers right so you can \\nsee here you\\'ve also got a really nice set of climate controls this is actually standard quad zone climate \\ncontrol you can do auto back here there\\'s even a nice little digital dis play here you can actually change \\nthe power of the fan and all that sort of good stuff um one of my favorite things about this car actually is \\nthat you can change the power of the fan while sticking it on auto which i feel like more cars need to do \\na lot o f cars will immediately adjust the power of the fan based on you know your temperature that you \\nselected to but i really like the fact that this allows you to choose whether or not you want a strong fan \\nor not similar to the third row you\\'ve got some usb p orts back here and let me show you the sensor \\narmrest so you\\'ve got some nice storage in the middle if we can put something back here and then \\nyou\\'ve got of course two cup holders as well pretty standard but it looks good and it\\'s easy to use the \\nleather a gain looks really really good this is soft touch plastic but it still feels and looks really luxurious \\nso let\\'s move back to the front of the car where we can go over the tech one of the coolest parts of this \\ncar is definitely how many standard features it  has even in the base model msrp is at 74 900 us dollars \\num this one is actually quite close to the base trim probably about 80 000 msrp that\\'s my guess right \\nhere i did rent this car from the national car rental at mco airport in orlando and i\\'m actually going to be \\nreturning it later today but wanted to film this car review before i returned it so moving into some of \\nthe really cool tech features of course the digital gauge cluster very configurable not quite as good as i \\nwould say the audi one but you ca n definitely do things like look through your apple carplay music you \\ncan also set it very easily using these different uh you know controls on the actual steering wheel i feel \\nlike this passes every single test in terms of you know having these to skip tr ack having this to increase \\nthe volume and everything like that um the other side is just a cruise control unfortunately the base \\nmodel of this car does not come with adaptive cruise control which i feel like is a little ridiculous given \\nthe price of this car and how luxurious it is but um hopefully bmw adds that probably in a pretty pretty \\n\\nclose year you\\'ve got this button right here on the left turn stock which actually allows you to change \\nwhat it shows on the right hand side you\\'ve got some pretty cool displays here um this car only has 3 \\n800 miles on it total so far uh you can see the ho rsepower and torque you can see a g -force monitor \\nwhich is kind of cool um and of course the media which is kind of what i keep it at the middle isn\\'t as \\nconfigurable which is really where i feel like the gauge cluster loses points compared to the audi but  um \\nbasically you can show a map that\\'s pretty much the only thing you can do you can show a map or show \\nno map um but it is really cool it looks really good if you\\'re using the built -in navigation for bmw it \\nshows you that as well in the left -hand side of  course you\\'ve just got the speedometer um and a lot of \\nthat is configurable one of the biggest things you\\'ll notice is that a lot of these things are a little hard to \\nfind at first i was like you know what time is it what drive mode am i in things like th at um but once once \\nyou stay in the car for a little bit you kind of get the hang of it so speaking of drive modes you\\'ve got \\nfour of them right here sport comfort ecopro and adaptive i pretty much stayed and adapted the whole \\ntime although this is definit ely one of those annoying cars that will default you back to comfort so as \\nyou can see this car is definitely meant more for a luxury than for the sporty side if you want the sporty \\nside you can opt for the new alpena xb7 which has almost twice the msrp bu t also almost twice the \\nhorsepower you\\'ve also got some you know standard equipment here with your parking sensors right \\nthere your camera which um this car actually does have the upgraded parking assistance package which \\nadds the 360 camera which is reall y really nice um of course the rotary dial like i mentioned before and \\nsome quick buttons to get you to different parts of the infotainment which is quite nice and finally \\nyou\\'ve also got your adaptive suspension on the right hand side which is really nice  you can change how \\nhigh or how low you want your car to be you\\'ve got hill assist your parking brake and of course auto \\nhold one of my favorite features in a lot of luxury cars these days this allows you to basically anytime \\nyou come to a full stop your c ar will just hold for you really really nice for long stop lights things like that \\nwhere you really want to take your foot off the brake you\\'ve got some pretty good storage here this \\ncompartment\\'s pretty deep you i got my sunglass container here got a rece ipt and a usb charger in here \\nas well you\\'ll notice there are a lot of usb chargers here the wireless charging is it works well but um it is \\nkind of annoying that your phone becomes so far in there because you really it\\'s kind of hard to reach \\nlater you\\'ve  got some really nice wood trim here and you also have ambient lighting you can kind of see \\ni chose a green i think there\\'s like four different options maybe five uh orange green uh lilac which is \\nreally gorgeous and a few other ones um you can\\'t really se e it in the rest of this car right now but it \\ndoes um go throughout the entire vehicle even in the third row seats you\\'ve got the nice wood trim \\ncontinues all across the dashboard i really really like it it looks really nice uh very similar to the lincoln \\nnavigator which i drove recently as well and also um you know a lot of the competitors like the \\nmercedes gls so the car i currently have does have the surround view 360 camera that only comes with \\nthe parking assistance package unfortunately though i would  definitely recommend opting for that you \\ncan see it\\'s got a really good resolution here and you can actually even activate the 3d view which is \\npretty cool take a look at that you can really see around the car which i feel like is super super cool um \\nyou can kind of move the way you want to view it but how cool is that and that\\'s a very accurate picture \\nof exactly where i am which is kind of crazy you\\'ve just got sensors all over the car and they show you \\npretty much every view you want one of my favorite features in this car actually is on the dorsal here \\nyou can see that little two right here that\\'s lit up that actually allows the driver to control the front \\npassenger seat how cool is that so you can move it up you know move the bolsters everything pretty  \\nmuch the exact same controls that the driver\\'s seat has in addition i can actually move the rear seats as \\nwell using these really cool buttons which i also think is very very cool i love the idea of being able to do \\neverything from the driver\\'s seat defin itely makes this a very good family suited vehicle the \\ninfotainment system in this car is pretty easy to use this is bmw\\'s high drive i do feel like there are some \\nthings you could do to catch up to some of the really nice you know mercedes benz mbux platf orm and \\nsome of the other competitors but overall pretty easy to use i do have i like how all the settings are \\npretty much in this one settings menu you have all these different things here that go everything from \\nyour key button settings to um you know ev erything else um this is also a touch screen but i i\\'ve noticed \\nthat i really just like using the rotary dial one of my favorite things here is that there are different \\nexperience modes and when you when you click on them weird things happen in your car li ke basically \\n\\nthe sunroof you know will basically close um different music will play um it\\'s a very interesting thing i \\ndon\\'t want to go through all of them right now but if you ever get the chance to rent this car or buy it i \\nwould highly recommend uh playing around wi th those you\\'ve also got some really interesting carrying \\ncar features here if you select one of these look three minute vitalize program that will invigorate the \\ndriver with the climate control lights and music um i did actually play around with that and it\\'s actually \\npretty fun um but i i was kind of laughing too hard honestly you do have apple carplay and android auto \\nboth are standard on the 2020 model your android auto is actually just added for the year um so \\nandroid users rejoice you can finally use that on this bmw x7 um the screen here is super responsive it \\nlooks really good it takes up the entire screen i love how it looks i pretty much use apple carplay the \\nentire time it also does have wireless apple carplay which i think is really cool because then you can put \\nit on the wireless charging tray and essentially still use carplay some closing thoughts on this car here \\none thing i just want to emphasize is just how good the inside looks how luxurious and elegant \\neverything is in this car it really ma kes you feel like you are in a top quality flagship suv some of its \\ncompetitors like the kia telluride the hyundai palisade in the uh non -luxury segment though are getting \\nreally close to the quality and i feel like bmw and mercedes especially with the gls  they have to keep up \\ntheir quality the lincoln navigator i feel like does feel more luxurious more luxurious than this but it is a \\nlot larger however it is around the same price for the base model i love the door handles i love the door \\nsills i love all o f this it feels really really good the stitching is everywhere the dash looks great and i love \\nhow they didn\\'t skimp out on the second row and third row they also feel and look really luxurious um i \\nlove the stitching and of course the heated seats are rea lly really nice this card does come with heated \\narmrests which is really interesting i don\\'t really know how useful they are but they do feel good um this \\nbase model only comes with heated front seats and rear seats but it does not come with a ventilated \\nseats unfortunately that you have to get in an additional package so driving the bmw x7 feels kind of like \\nfloating um i feel like any large suv feels very similar to this but with the adaptive air suspension on this \\ncar it really does make it feel like you \\'re floating over those potholes wherever you\\'re living um the 331 \\npound -feet of torque really do make this car feel quite torquey i feel like uh bmw quotes is zero to 60 \\nand 5.8 and i feel like that\\'s pretty pretty darn accurate um i\\'ll try to rev it up h ere in a little bit i\\'ll be \\ngetting on the freeway in a little bit so hopefully we\\'ll be able to get a little bit of that power in but \\notherwise you never feel like this isn\\'t powerful enough um if you do feel like it\\'s not powerful enough \\nyou can upgrade some of the higher trims which definitely have all of that power that you\\'d want um \\nbut for now uh the turbocharged six cylinder is totally fine you can see here i\\'m at a stop the auto hold \\nfeature kicks in i\\'m not my foot isn\\'t on the brake or anything li ke that and uh feels really good i think \\none of my favorite parts of this car as well is how when everything when you\\'re at a stop everything is \\nso quiet and i feel like you know no matter how loud the outside is you don\\'t really hear much of that \\nand that  really enhances that feeling of luxury in this car all right so let\\'s see if we can get some nice revs \\nhere we\\'re getting on this big bridge so you can hear the engine i am going up a very steep hill right now \\nthough so definitely not the easiest thing th ere but of course there\\'s a lot of power there um definitely \\ndidn\\'t feel like you needed more power or anything like that and otherwise when you\\'re just cruising it \\nfeels very serene in this car great family hauler i feel like i can\\'t say that enough of co urse with the \\ncaptain\\'s chairs that only puts you at six people but even in this kind of like bad road very very quiet \\ngoing 50 miles per hour right here and it really doesn\\'t feel like it at all i found myself you know often \\ngoing to speeds that you know we\\'re definitely faster than i was expecting which i feel like is is going to \\nbe a common trend when you\\'re driving a car like this so i kind of wanted to show what some freeway \\ndriving was like um i\\'m going pretty fast right here about 85 and it\\'s so quie t right like you would never \\nthink that you\\'re going this fast um that air suspension just it feels really really good the ride quality on \\nthis is fantastic um i guess the problem though is that all the competitors also have great ride quality \\nright when y ou\\'re in this segment everyone is using their best their best suspension right everyone has \\nreally really nice smooth rides and you kind of need a way to differentiate yourself here um but you \\nknow at least this isn\\'t a negative bmw definitely did this cor rectly some other thoughts while i\\'m stuck \\nhere at a very long red light which i feel like is super common in the orlando florida area um i really hate \\nhow many features on this car are packages i do love these standard tech features they\\'re really really \\ngood those digital displays are awesome but when you\\'re paying about 80 thousand dollars for a car i \\n\\nwould expect it to come standard with the surround view camera with a 360 camera but that is in a \\npackage um luckily you know you get blindfold monitors parking sensors all that stuff is standard which \\nis really great but there are some features that i jus t feel like are missing and i really would appreciate \\nhere uh for example the stereo system is amazing this ten speaker system sounds really really good but \\ni\\'m surprised it\\'s not some sort of name brand one the harman kardonis upgraded sound system here \\num but in almost all the other luxury cars at this price point i feel like they come standard um the gls \\ncomes standard with the burmester sound system which is phenomenal um again not to discredit the \\nsound system it\\'s honestly one of the best i\\'ve driven especially considering it\\'s not an upgraded one \\nthis sounds really really good but i do feel like there are certain things they\\'re missing soft closed doors i \\nfeel like that should be a thing but that\\'s included in a package a heads -up display also in a pa ckage \\nunfortunately not the one i have here but yeah again this is a pretty base model um msrp is around 80 \\n000 which is which is not terrible for this price point i feel like if you get a gls it\\'s also going to you know \\ntear you apart those packages it wi ll easily put you in the six figures um but i would definitely \\nrecommend getting some packages like the premium package which includes the heads -up display and \\nsome other really nice features like the harman kardon sound system so definitely take a look at  the \\npackages and figure out what would be the best for you but i would highly recommend getting some of \\nthose packages because i feel like they really enhance the luxury features in this car and i feel like that\\'s \\nreally what this car is all about  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW X7  \\nReview:  \\n[Music] today i\\'m behind it with a brand new 2021 bmw x7 and this is the biggest and most luxurious \\nsuv within bmw\\'s very crowded suv lineup yes you have the x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 and soon x8 yes bmw \\nhas a very crowded suv lineup now in this video i\\'m going  to go over the changes for 2021 and cover \\neverything there is to know about this brand new x7 so you can decide if this full -size luxury suv from \\nbmw is right for you all right let\\'s get started now normally i\\'ll be driving right now i would be driving \\nthis x7 around town and telling you about the drive and also be telling about the features and things \\nthat you would find on the inside and outside for this x7 but since there\\'s so much to cover i\\'m gonna sit \\nright here in the parking lot and i\\'m gonna go ov er those luxury features and features overall first then \\ngo for a drive now why don\\'t we just start out with the outside the x7 since it is the biggest and most \\nluxurious suv within bmw\\'s lineup of course bmw had to give it the biggest kidney grills ever s een on a \\nbmw those kidney girls up front are massive enormous if you think those kidney grills look big in videos \\nor in pictures think again wait until you actually see them in person they are absolutely massive now \\nbesides the gigantic kidney grills you h ave some icon adaptive full led headlights on both sides they \\ncome with auto high beam and of course they do have very distinctive looking led daytime running \\nlights also you get led fog lights with this x7 now everything put together right the front end i s big bold \\nvery upright and it does look a little bit different than say the x5 or the x6 there\\'s something about it \\nthat just looks bigger and bolder and yeah overall i like the front end now moving to the side that\\'s how \\nyou can tell the x7 is enormous i t just looks big it\\'s very long it\\'s very tall it\\'s very wide and this is a good \\nexample of how big it is look at those wheels those wheels at first glance i thought they were 19 -inch or \\n20-inch wheels no standard you get 21 -inch wheels and they look okay they don\\'t look too big they \\ndon\\'t actually look very big on this x7 and that kind of shows you how big this x7 is on the outside now \\nyou do have a lot of satin aluminum trim on the side you know towards the bottom of the door which is \\nnice and also window  surrounds their aluminum sand aluminum and same thing look at the roof rails \\nvery beefy sand aluminum roof rails that you could actually use they\\'re not just for design purposes they \\ncould actually be used which is really nice now moving on to the back of  course you have the usual large \\nprivacy glass a spoiler shark antenna on top you do have some nice looking led tail lamps out back and \\nyou have dual chrome finishers out back too which is pretty nice and if you wanted to tow you could opt \\nfor the trailer hitch as you see here and the x7 could tow about six thousand pounds depending how \\nyou configure it anywhere from fifty four hundred pounds to six thousand pounds now moving out back \\nyou have a power liftgate of course now this design is a clamshell design  just like the x5 so when you \\n\\nfirst open it it\\'s only the upper half and you have to press a button to fold down the second half right \\nnow the good thing is if you want to close it you just press the button on top and they both close \\nsimultaneously the bad thing is they don\\'t both open  simultaneously there is one extra step now what\\'s \\nnice is from back here if you think the loading height is too high you can simply press a button and the \\nx7 will lower for you because this x7 comes with adaptive air suspension yes you can lower the ride \\nheight in the back for easier access now behind the third row you have a good amount of room for \\ngroceries or small luggage and on the side you have a 12v outlet you have a net to hold things \\nunderneath you do have some hidden storage and on the left side you have a whole bunch of switches \\nyes you have a lot of switches and a lot of controls everywhere inside this x7 there is a set of switches to \\nfold down the second row set switches to fold down the third row and a set of switches to fold down \\nboth the sec ond row and the third row or to lift up the second row and third row the good thing is \\neverything is at your fingertips and everything is one touch you don\\'t have to continuously hold it down \\nall you have to do is tap it and away it goes now the bad thing is since everything is electronically \\ncontrolled it\\'s very slow very very slow once you press the button you gotta wait about five seconds for \\nanything to even happen and then you probably have to wait about a full twenty or thirty seconds for it \\nto comple te whether to go down or up right so there\\'s the good and bad to all these electronic switches \\nand seats now moving to the second row if you do opt for the premium package you do get soft closing \\nautomatic doors which is really nice and in the second row y ou do have a whole bunch of switches \\nthere\\'s a lot more switches in the second row than even in the third row so on the seat back on the very \\ntop there is a switch and this is what you use to fold down the second row if you wanted to now there\\'s \\nanother sw itch on the side this is what you use to fold the second row forward or backwards to get into \\nthe third row and then there\\'s a separate set of switches on the side and you use that to fold down or \\nup the third row so as you can see there\\'s a lot of switche s and you just have to get used to which ones \\ncontrol what now once you\\'re in the third row there\\'s okay space for emergencies it\\'s okay you can see \\ni\\'m five feet ten my knees hit the seat back but second row passengers can move forward a little bit to \\ngive uh third row passengers a bit more room so that\\'s nice you do get a pair of vents on top and if you \\nhave the cold weather package then you have a separate climate control just for the third row which is \\nreally nice now moving back to the second row you d o have two pairs of vents also climate controls \\nheated seats only if you opt for the cold weather package once again right but it\\'s dual zone climate \\ncontrol and you have usb ports and a 12v outlet and again all the all the seat function is automatic so \\nyou can recline and slide and basically everything is automatic in the second row what\\'s also nice is on \\nthe doors on both sides you do have switches for the sun shades the automatic sun shades if you do \\nhave the premium package also you have switches to con trol the dual sunroofs on top yes you can \\ncontrol the sunroofs even from the second row and i haven\\'t seen that before that\\'s pretty unique now \\nmoving on front very luxurious kind of looks like a x5 overall design shape everything except it\\'s just a \\nlittle  bit bigger and there\\'s a little bit more switches and a little bit more features just looking at the \\ndoor panel you can see there\\'s a good use of aluminum and leather but there\\'s a whole bunch of \\nswitches and buttons so this button on the bottom here cont rol the sun shade for the second row they \\nwill lift up or down both of them simultaneously right you have window locked you know automatic \\nwindows those are pretty usual then you have a button for the power folding mirrors okay then you \\nhave a switch for t he power liftgate in the back right and then on the door you have your memory seats \\nand then you have a switch and a button for the second row so if you wanted to uh move the second \\nrow forward so passengers could get in the third row you can use a switch and do that and if you \\nwanted to only do it on one side there\\'s a button that you press and then you use the switch right so a \\nlot of switches for the the electronic seats in here everywhere there\\'s switches and buttons right now \\nmoving the light control t here\\'s a whole bunch of things that you could do but basically i think you just \\nleave it in auto and that\\'s it and don\\'t worry about it auto high beam right when the lights turn on \\neverything is automatic and uh same thing with your fog lights steering whe el of course you have a \\nleather wrapped steering wheel has a good thickness overall feels good and it looks good you do have a \\nheated steering wheel on the bottom you have a whole bunch of switches on both sides to control \\nvolume phone you know scrolling m uting your cruise control all that you do have paddle shifters in the \\nback and also look at the live cockpit pro that\\'s about a 12 inch digital gauge cluster very very nice the \\n\\ninterface looks good and it\\'s nice and bright you have your maps in the middle and on the right side you \\ncan scroll through a few things for example your g\\'s or your radio station or you know what driving \\nmode you\\'re in your fuel economy stuff like that ho wever i gotta say that this is a little bit more limiting \\nthan say the one inside audis which gives you multiple views and there\\'s just more things to look at this \\nlive cockpit pro is kind of just limited in terms of what you see now moving to the infotain ment system \\nthat is now running i drive seven this screen is just as big 12.3 inches and one of the new things for 2021 \\nis filing the addition of android auto in addition to apple carplay so that is one big change now this touch \\nscreen is beautiful it\\'s re ally beautiful it\\'s very responsive very bright i love the interface you can figure \\nout just messing around the menus pretty easy to figure out although there\\'s a lot of things you can \\nadjust from lights to audio to safety systems i mean there\\'s a whole bu nch of things that you can adjust \\nnow you could do everything with just your fingers with touch or you could use this idrive interface with \\na big scroll knob that you can scroll and point left and right press down there\\'s a few quick navigating \\nbuttons tha t you can use in conjunction with this screen but if you didn\\'t want to use that just simply \\nuse your hands and fingers and it works just the same now part of the premium package you do get \\nsomething called gesture control which this screen will read your fingers now i\\'ll admit i didn\\'t take time \\nto learn this whole thing i\\'m just trying to you know mess with it and just to do this with the volume it \\nkind of works and it kind of doesn\\'t so i don\\'t know how useful that is i don\\'t know how many people \\nwill ac tually remember all the gestures and try on and on and on right i think it\\'s just easier to just touch \\nor use the volume knob that\\'s just my opinion now underneath the screen you have a button for your \\ndriver system features and inside this x7 you pretty m uch get it all emergency braking warning lane \\nassist line spot monitoring rear cross traffic alert that\\'s all included unfortunately the only thing not \\nincluded is adaptive cruise control because that\\'s part of a bigger package that adds on more advanced \\nthings like automatic uh lane changing so unfortunately adaptive cruise control is not standard \\nunderneath that you have a small little screen to control your climate control it\\'s actually pretty bright it \\nworks pretty well you have a few buttons to control  auto your fan speed your temperature right and \\nthen you have a row for other things like defroster options and so forth and you get heated seats if you \\nopt for the cold weather package underneath that you have a row of presets these are kind of like \\nfavor ites so you can program them to go to certain places uh that you use often you have a volume \\nknob so underneath this cover you do have wireless charging and space for other things two cup holders \\nand additional usb port now the shifter is just like all the  other bmws they kind of work the same kind of \\ndon\\'t you have to hold down the button and then you just press up to reverse back down right or going \\nto manual and there is a button for parking now this x7 is equipped with parking a system package \\nwhich aut omatically parks for you and it gives you the surround view with 3d view which is a 360 view of \\nyour x7 which is really nice so of course you get a view of what\\'s behind you and everywhere around \\nyou and i love the animation when you\\'re going from one side  to another looks pretty nifty now around \\nthe shifter you have the start engine button and also drive mode so you can select sport and you can \\ncustomize it so basically sport automatically changes everything to sport but if you wanted to just say \\nadjust th e steering or the throttle or suspension you can and then of course you have the comfort eco \\nand you can adjust eco and eco pretty much adjust like the climate control and stuff like that and you \\nhave adaptive where the x7 will kind of predict your driving  conditions and will adapt to your driving \\nstyle so pretty cool now besides the auto hold brake and uh hill descent you do have a switch to control \\nyour height control so if you want to lower your x7 or raise it right you can but the x7 will automatically \\nadjust depending on your driving speed on top you have homelink buttons under rear view mirror and \\ncontrols for the dual sunroofs which you already get in the second row but again you get up here so of \\ncourse you can open the big panoramic one up here and for the second row and you can open and close \\nthe little one for the third row passenger all right i\\'m finally behind the wheel so now let me talk about \\nhow this x7 feels on the road and how it drives first like most luxury suvs out there one of the things  \\nthat you\\'ll notice right away once you start driving is the seat belt retracts and it\\'s the same with this x7 i \\nknow it\\'s a little gimmicky but i fall for it every time i love it it just makes you feel like it\\'s special another \\nthing i noticed right away is when you\\'re getting inside the x7 it\\'s actually a little bit of a challenge this \\nx7 is quite high so when it\\'s in standard hype mode for some of you guys on the shorter side you may \\nhave difficulty getting in because this x7 does sit higher than the x5 and of course the x3 so that is \\n\\nsomething else i noticed right away when i was trying to get in but once you get in what i like is this \\ncommanding view right of course you can\\'t adjust the height but the normal height you know i definitely \\nfeel like this is more like a full -size suv i\\'m sitting a little bit higher and overall commanding view and \\nvisibility is fantastic fantastic now visibility overall is great besides the elevated and commanding view \\nbecause of the seating position but the windows everywhere is enormous enormous front win dshield is \\nbig i can see well over the hood same thing on the side windows the door panels are nice and low so the \\nwindows are humongous same during the blind spot even though you have blind spot monitoring but \\nblind spot is good and the rear visibility is  also good i mean the rear tailgate window is nice and big so \\nvisibility overall is good driving position is also good now what\\'s also good no i take that back what\\'s \\nfantastic is the suspension and the comfort of this drive right now it is so so soft it i s unbelievably soft \\nlike you\\'re you\\'re sitting on a cloud i mean i thought the x5 suspension was good this x7 is a whole other \\nlevel i mean literally you\\'re you\\'re not feeling anything you\\'re just kind of floating over right now i\\'m in \\ncomfort mode i\\'m not  in sport i\\'ll test out sport a little bit but in comfort mode man is this smooth it\\'s \\nreally really smooth and in a good way in a good way and uh those of you guys looking for a a really \\ncomfortable ride yeah you will get that in this x7 now besides a com fortable suspension the seats up \\nhere are pretty good too i mean they\\'re a little bit on the harsher side a stiffer side i i kind of expected \\nthem to be a little bit more soft but overall isn\\'t too bad the bolstering is good unfortunately you have \\nto offer  real leather yes real leather costs additional money which i think is silly uh for a luxury car \\nespecially with this price tag but yeah unfortunately you do but if you do offer leather it smells good the \\nshape uh the design right the texture all feel pret ty good but you know right now the seat back you \\nknow bolsters holding my back in the bottom cushion is okay although like i said i expected a little softer \\nit\\'s a little bit stiffer but you know overall isn\\'t too bad and same thing with the second row and  third \\nrow the second row felt just as good just as good and in terms of space i mean there\\'s loads of it loads \\nof it up front of course you can see plenty of headroom right shoulder room hip room i mean this is like \\na full -size suv so space should not be a problem so up front uh plenty big second row same thing if you \\nhave the second roll all the way pushed back i have almost like 12 inches of leg room so plenty plenty of \\nspace in the second row and you know what about the same in head room and a third row  third row is \\nnot bad if you move up the second row a little bit yeah i mean there\\'s good space for adults [Music] \\nokay so just test out acceleration i had a little bit of a straight away now i was in comfort mode and i \\nknow i know if i go in sport mode it \\'ll make a big difference but in comfort mode acceleration is uh is \\ngood you know doesn\\'t feel too slow but didn\\'t feel too lively either now because this is the base trim \\nthis is not like the m50i or the alpina one this one comes with the standard three l iter turbocharged i6 \\nmade it to a eight speed automatic now this is the same engine that you find in the x5 and i loved it i \\nloved it when i test drilled the x5 and it\\'s really no different with this x7 right now driving around town \\nthis transmission is bu tter smooth i i can\\'t even tell when it\\'s shifting it\\'s really really uh really really nice \\nand you know acceleration is good there\\'s not a whole lot of sound i don\\'t hear much from the engine \\nor exhaust it is very muted it\\'s very quiet in here but now one  big change for 2021 is that this engine is \\nmated to now a 48 volt mild hybrid engine yes there\\'s a mild hybrid engine now attached and it\\'s \\nsupposed to help with the engine auto start stop functionality and help with other things that may need \\na quick jol t now what\\'s strange is fuel economy actually went down on this x7 even with that attached \\nso that\\'s a little bit of a head scratcher so i\\'m not sure what the deal is with that now as for breaking i\\'m \\na little surprised though the pedal is a little mushy i t does feel a little mushy which means that you know \\nthere\\'s like a little give and you\\'re gonna press down a little bit harder and because of the comfortable \\nair suspension i do feel like their the body moves forward when you brake especially when you\\'re \\nbraking hard right i didn\\'t expect that i mean you usually get that with heavy big vehicles big trucks i did \\nnot expect that with x7 so the brakes i\\'ll just say it\\'s so so it\\'s not as fantastic as the other things i\\'ve \\nmentioned now i mentioned about how q uiet it is in here it is really quiet it it\\'s it\\'s almost like ev car \\nquiet it is very very well insulated in here no wind noise at all none nothing from the road right actually \\nnothing from the road almost nothing from the engine unless you really acceler ate and cars passing by i \\nreally don\\'t hear it i mean it is dead quiet in here now as for steering i mentioned about this nice \\nsteering wheel ready it feels good but the steering feel right now is just so so there\\'s actually quite a lot \\nof steering play a lot more than i expected and the weight is okay but because of the steering play it \\n\\nmakes me feel like the steering is a little vague i\\'m not too in control right but again this is comfort \\nmode right and this will get adjusted in sport mode so next see my gesture control just popped up again \\nuh that that\\'s really really bothering me okay so next i\\'m gonna put this x7 in sport mode i\\'m just gonna \\nleave it default where everything everything is turned on so let\\'s see how it is now with sport mode i \\ncan tell the steering did get heavier i could tell that it\\'s a little bit heavier so for those  of you guys that \\nenjoy the drive uh you\\'ll enjoy this a little bit more unfortunately the precision didn\\'t get any better \\nthere\\'s still a lot of steering play so yeah it does improve upon it somewhat but not as much as i would \\nhave liked yeah the sport mo de didn\\'t didn\\'t touch the brakes um i didn\\'t expect it to but the brakes still \\nfeel a little a little mushy now what else changed for 2021 well there are some subtractions \\nunfortunately so there was an off -road package which added a limited slip different ial and also panels \\nunderneath in case you wanted to go off -roading unfortunately that was removed due to the pandemic \\nalso an entertainment package that was available that has also been removed also a trim level and an \\nengine option was also removed the x -drive 50i that was removed so now if you want to go up to a v8 \\nengine you have to go to the crazy m50i which is over 500 horsepower so yeah there was a lot of things \\nactually removed for 2021 unfortunately now as for the suspension and sport mode i defini tely do feel a \\ndifference it\\'s a it\\'s still comfortable but i do feel like yeah i feel a little bit more bumps um just going \\nover pavement right so i could tell it did stiffen up actually i would say quite a bit versus comfort but it\\'s \\nstill not uncomforta ble the drive definitely feels different in this x7 versus say x5 at first glance you just \\nthink okay x7 is a stretched out x5 but once you drive it you realize it\\'s really not it\\'s actually a lot more \\nthan that it is bigger it\\'s taller it\\'s more comfortab le it\\'s quieter i mean everything about the x7 is just \\nelevated so it is quite different when you\\'re driving it [Music] oh yeah okay yeah like i like i expected \\nsport mode made a huge difference with acceleration not only does the transmission hold the gea r \\nlonger lets the rev gets up there right but also uh you can just tell there\\'s a lot more boost and and this \\nx7 feels a whole lot different when you\\'re accelerating what\\'s impressive is this engine is the base one \\nand still you get a very powerful engine very lively drive most people would be satisfied with this \\npowertrain but of course if you wanted more power you can get it you could opt for it so next up let me \\ntalk about the different trim levels and pricing and give you my final thoughts on this brand  new bmw x7 \\nas for trim levels the bmw x7 has three for 2021. the base is the xdrive40i and that starts under 75 000. \\n0-60 comes in around 5.8 seconds then you have the m50i which starts a tad under a hundred thousand \\ndollars zero sixty drops to four point  five seconds finally you have the alpina xb7 which is over a hundred \\nand forty one thousand dollars and zero to sixty comes in in four seconds flat to conclude the 2021 bmw \\nx7 is well deserving of its status and price tag the big luxury suv looks big and bold on the outside and \\nprovides plenty of space and cargo room on the inside everything on the inside is electronically \\ncontrolled and the air suspension makes the ride feel like a cloud and also makes getting stuff in and out \\na breeze the x7 is extremely  quiet provides a commanding view and has great acceleration the x7 can \\nalso be equipped with all the latest features one would be looking for the bad to the x7 include the \\nmushy brakes that doesn\\'t feel like it belongs the steering also has some play whic h doesn\\'t get any \\nbetter in sport mode there are a lot of packages removed for 2021 and the non -v8 option is now gone \\nfinally fuel economy gets slightly worse for 2021. overall i\\'m giving the 2021 bmw x7 a score of 104. to \\nsee where it ranks check out driv

hey guys it\\'s kelly and today i am so excited to bring you a 2021 bmw x7 this is definitely one of \\nmy dream cars but i\\'m excited today to put it to the test with all things car seats and strollers this is your \\nfirst time joining us hey i\\'m kelly an d i\\'m the car room i review cars for moms and for families make sure \\nyou give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel because you\\'re not going to want to miss \\nany of the content i have coming up make sure to leave a comment below about which car  i should tour \\nnext and let\\'s get started [Music] okay so let\\'s start with her exterior because she is so good looking first \\nthings is the front end get grill the signature kidney grill every bmw since the beginning of time basically \\n\\nhas some variation of this kidney grill right here i love this one i love the high chrome all the way around \\nit the beautiful bmw logo into this gorgeous huge white hood with some great nice lines we come \\naround to some wrapping led headlights with some be autiful daytime running lights on right now more \\nchrome down here i mean there\\'s just something about a white bmw i think she is absolutely stunning \\nlesbian to the side we have some blackout wheels which i think gives it a really nice contrast with this \\nmineral white car and then we go into what can only be described as a chrome hockey stick just slapped \\non there but you know what i\\'m kind of here for it actually i love having a little mirror a little lip gloss \\nchecker we love to see that we\\'ve got some chr ome roof rails a little bit of like a faux running board \\ndown here and it\\'s just i think it\\'s stunning comment below what you think of the exterior it\\'s one of my \\nfavorite looking cars on the road i think she\\'s so cute okay moving on to the back and we sta rt with \\nsome wrap around tail lights right here a huge chrome bar that goes all the way across not my favorite \\nlook but it\\'s okay x7 badging we have um dual square exhaust right here wiper kind of wish it was \\ntucked underneath there but that\\'s okay the one  i\\'m doing today is the xdrive40i so it is a all -wheel drive \\nsix cylinder the x7 also comes in an eight cylinder stay tuned to the end of the video though because i\\'m \\nactually going to be building my own x7 and i will talk you all through the different tri m levels there \\noverall exterior i think she\\'s stunning i think she\\'s beautiful and i think we\\'re all gonna like the interior \\ntoo okay so here\\'s a shot of me in the driver\\'s seat of this 2020 bmw x7 right from the get -go she is just \\nscreaming luxury we are doing a higher trim today a lot of nice packages added onto this one this one \\nhas an msrp of 86 thousand dollars that\\'s expensive so let\\'s see what we\\'re getting for that much money \\nif we start by looking at the door panel honestly it is a little basic i t hink that bmw really plays with that \\nluxury and sport and i think they do it pretty nicely it\\'s definitely not as luxurious looking as like a lexus \\nor a mercedes it\\'s a lot sportier kind of like the audis of the world i love it um so we\\'ve got some \\ncontras t stitching you know some nice chrome i like this little uh lock button in the chrome as well and \\nthen these chrome buttons i think is just all a nice detail side cubbies there look pretty good let\\'s test it \\nwith a water bottle oh wow oh that\\'s really nice  okay i mean that that that\\'s it for me that does a really \\ngood job okay so let\\'s talk about some of my driver\\'s comfort because the seats are a little bit firmer i \\nthink it just kind of depends what your personal preference is um they\\'re pretty they\\'re ju st firm it\\'s a \\nsport style seat if you guys can see i have bolsters coming out right here just to really hug me i do really \\nlike this part right here this is like an extra knee support so i\\'m really tall like about six feet tall so i like \\nthat i could move  this thing in and out to give me a little bit more support right there so i think that\\'s \\nawesome overall comfort though is pretty good visibility visibility\\'s decent visibility is pretty good you \\nknow this is a six or seven passenger car depending on if y ou get the bench or the captain\\'s chairs it \\ndoesn\\'t feel that big which is kind of exciting to me but let\\'s see how i feel about the third row from this \\npart right here i don\\'t feel like i\\'m driving the three row car all right so let\\'s start with some of t he \\ntechnology in this car we have got heads up display now it\\'s not going to pick up on camera but heads \\nup display displays how fast i\\'m going what the speed limit is who\\'s calling me what radio station i\\'m \\nlistening to where my next navigation turn is wh atever you want to have displayed it\\'s right there it\\'s \\nnot distracting and i think it\\'s a huge safety feature because i can totally see who\\'s calling me where i \\nneed to turn how fast i\\'m going without taking my eyes off the road so i love heads up display  then i \\nmove beautifully into a full digital display i love digital displays i think they are gorgeous i think they \\nprovide a lot of customization absolutely obsessed this one\\'s super cool because i can literally display \\nmy navigation so i can see where i am which i think is super fun then we move into this very nice \\ncompletely touch screen very user friendly display and there is a ton of different things that you can do \\nin this thing starting with just the basics like changing the radio station um your nav igation your \\nbluetooth and then the bmw just like gives you things that i don\\'t think anyone asked for to be honest \\ni\\'m not sure any person to ask for these features but here they are okay so the bmw comes with a \\nbunch of different drive modes we\\'ve got ou r sports our comfort our economy but i did not know it \\ncame with what they call experience modes what\\'s an experience mode well i\\'m still not entirely sure \\nbut all i know is that if i press like this well being button it puts my sun shades up it adjusts my  air and it \\njust says to immerse yourself in a relaxed atmosphere and enjoy some downtime okay um i can also go \\nto expressive mode which opens things up back up now it\\'s time to enjoy life and positive energy i think \\nthis is a very fancy way to do things a utomatically for you do i think i would hit a button when i\\'m feeling \\n\\nexpressive to open up my sunroof no do i think if i wanted to open up my sunroof and put down my \\nwindow shades all with one button i guess you could just do that the last one is executive you guessed it \\nthings are going back up it says use this cool calm a tmosphere to focus your thoughts thanks x7 okay \\nlet\\'s move down to some of the climate control and just like some of the more actual features we might \\nactually use we have climate control right here we have all of our driver resistance features super easy \\nto turn on and off if needed then this kills me all these buttons are so beautiful i mean we even talked \\nabout the 14 carat shifter that we\\'re gonna get to they put these like weird little cheap plasticky buttons \\nin here i just don\\'t understand why they ch eaped out right there not obsessed with that but we moved \\ndown i\\'ve got a wireless charger a little cubby space right here usb two cup holders love when the cup \\nholders are like this because then there\\'s no confusion about whose is which cup when the cup h olders \\nare like this i never know which one\\'s mine so i think that looks great okay now we move into the crown \\njewel one of the most beautiful things i have ever seen in my life this shifter i mean if i could slap this \\nthing and put it on my finger and wea r it as a wedding ring i would it is absolutely stunning and they \\ndon\\'t stop there this little track pad also completely iced out the stop start button iced out high gloss \\nblack exposed wood trim i mean this is like luxury central right here i think this i s absolutely gorgeous \\nobsessed with it moving into our center console she\\'s a little tiny tiny actually was hoping this will be a \\nlittle bit bigger she\\'s a little tine tine there i do have an additional usbc so fun stuff um what else can we \\nsee oh my gosh this is the smallest mirror i\\'ve literally ever seen in my life i can\\'t even see my whole face \\ni can literally see this much in my face panoramic sunroof just absolutely gorgeous and it\\'s in the second \\nrow and then the third row has its own little mini sun roof which is darling you can control everything \\nfrom here which is awesome you can even control um the sun shades so you can put the sunshades up \\nand down too which i think is awesome for like having little kiddos back there obsessed with that all \\nright h ere is a shot of me in the second row of this bmw x7 so much nice space back here actually so i \\nhave this seat set for myself at six feet tall great knee clearance now like i said earlier the bmw x7 comes \\nin a bench or captions chairs i\\'m doing the captain \\'s chairs today the bench has nothing to write home \\nabout though it\\'s it\\'s a very narrow bench it\\'s not very popular in this model the captain\\'s chairs are a lot \\nbetter i would recommend thinking about this car as a six passenger car really is a very comfo rtable four \\npassenger car but as far as my second row is concerned super comfortable check out these side cubbies \\ni\\'m talking deep little trouble with oh there there she goes nice nice nice love the side cubby okay so \\ninteresting i have all the control rig ht here i can do whatever i want i can open the third row sun shade i \\ncan control this sun shade i can control this sun shade and i can even close this thing if i want to it\\'s kind \\nof like a lot of control for some passenger drivers i\\'m sure you can lock i t next thing that\\'s a little funny is \\nhere\\'s my vents here and here not on the ceiling third row on the ceiling i prefer ceiling events if you \\nhave rear -facing kids like myself because i think they get kind of hot in the summer but with these vents \\non the side i do think it would probably provide some pretty good circulation so that looks nice we\\'ve \\ngot two more cupholders right here with two usbc\\'s in my own climate control as well as heated seats in \\nthis trim level i\\'m pretty comfy i mean it\\'s very luxuri ous i\\'m feeling very luxurious can\\'t wait to put a car \\nseat in it though okay so let\\'s chat about the car seat set up a little bit so today i brought my graco \\nextended fit i put it rear facing this captain\\'s chairs to give you an idea of space good spacing  kind of as i \\nwas expecting now the interesting thing is that actually every single seat back here has its own set of \\ntether anchors and lower anchors so it\\'s actually really surprised to see that i will try to install a car seat \\nin the third row in a seco nd if you\\'re considering this car i highly suggest that you consult a certified \\nchild passenger safety technician just to make sure that your specific car seat setup will work for this car \\ni\\'m just trying to give you an idea of the space okay i just want t o talk about kind of like the functionality \\nof this car from a mom\\'s perspective because the x7 is not it if you\\'re gonna have to have car seats up \\nhere and then still utilize that third row there\\'s no car seat friendly tilt this aisle is borderline non -\\nexistent so even if you have kids in booster seats because there\\'s no way you can\\'t go through the aisle \\nright here you can\\'t hold the seat down and access it with the car seat it would be very difficult to use \\nthat third row so just something to consider if  you\\'re looking at this car um let me hop in the third arno \\ni\\'m also not going to lie to you these seats are kind of driving me absolutely crazy because they\\'re like \\nthey\\'re trying to help too much quite frankly so you\\'re like okay is that how i do it now this seat moves \\nup and then you have to just sit here and wait okay so here i am in the third row of the bmw x7 a little \\n\\nstressed i\\'m not gonna lie because there\\'s so many buttons and then nothing\\'s labeled correctly i\\'m \\ngonna get to all that in a second let\\'s just talk about my amenities so i love my own little private sunroof \\nthat\\'s absolutely darling i think i\\'m looking s o cute i have heated seats back here too so how about that \\nhuge seats in the third row my own climate control vents are on the ceiling which is awesome i\\'ve got a \\nusb c back here and i have the tiniest coupler nothing fits there nothing fits there okay let \\'s talk about \\nhow to get these seats back because i\\'m honestly not even 100 sure okay yeah why oh my gosh why \\nwould everyone put my own seat back okay i guess you could put the third row down from right there \\nokay hot dog i don\\'t know how to bring this bac k oh okay now it\\'s doing it oh my gosh this is absolutely \\nterrifying okay i\\'m back here and i\\'m gonna have a good attitude about it um i\\'m back here my knee \\nclearance is pretty good now we have this seat all the way back and my knees still aren\\'t touching so \\nthat\\'s pretty exciting the seats back here are actually pretty wide like as you can see i like that they\\'re \\njust trying to make this a two -seater bat here not a three seater because i\\'m actually pretty comfortable \\ni\\'ve got really good head clearance for  a third row so i\\'m i\\'m happy i just cannot believe how like long \\nevery seat takes to move and like this is just a scenario i just wish it wasn\\'t power i wish i could just do it \\nmyself because i feel like that would just be so much easier so i don\\'t know a  guy cute little window here \\ni\\'m pretty comfy i would call it a love hate okay after a little um hard work i was able to install this gray \\nhooks and the fit forward -facing in the third row i the headrests are not removable back here but i was \\nable to secur ely put my tether strap through and it\\'s not affecting the headrest because it\\'s not like \\nbulging out too much i\\'m moving less than an inch at the belt path so overall feeling pretty good about \\nthis installation again try it out with your own car seats let \\'s talk about this trunk love this i already love \\nthis you know what this is it\\'s called a watermelon catcher it\\'s called you go to costco you live on a hill \\nyou open your trunk up nothing flies out love this to open this part you just hit this completely power \\nand then i love that it gives you a nice little like trunk extender it\\'s also a good like hoist and slide \\nsituation really like to see this um we\\'ve got a pretty little deep like side compartment down here which \\nis kind of cute come with run flat tir es so no spare tire i don\\'t think my shoulder\\'s gonna fit but let\\'s try \\noh i stand correct well let\\'s see okay i was not expecting that that\\'s freaking exciting okay so what i like \\nabout back here is even though it\\'s all power and takes 756 56 years you ca n control everything from \\nback here so i can put these seats down nice do the other one oh gosh okay it\\'s like things start moving \\nand i don\\'t know what to expect but anyway good sized trunk with the third row down we\\'re just driving \\naround guys in the bmw  x7 let me just tell you something it\\'s like driving on glass it is so smooth it \\naccelerates so nicely it handles beautifully do not i feel like i\\'m driving a sports car and i\\'m driving a big \\nsuv absolutely love the drive i love the drive of bmws is the ca r the most functional for car seats no do i \\nthink it would be no do i feel like a badass a hundred percent yes i do would i buy this car no would i buy \\nthis car if i could afford three yes i love it i mean it\\'s it\\'s to me it\\'s a dream car status it\\'s not f unctional \\nwith me and my current kids in their car seat situation if they were older i knew you put it on my list but \\ni mean i would drive it with no kids i just absolutely love it so thank you so much for watching special \\nshout out to bmw of west st louis  here in st louis for lending me the car for the morning if you want to \\nlend me lend it to me for longer next time i would not say no to that make sure you subscribe to my \\nchannel give this video a thumbs up and turn on the bell icon because i\\'m telling yo u guys i\\'ve got \\ncontent coming and it\\'s going to be good okay bye all right y\\'all let\\'s build this 2021 bmw x7 so there\\'s \\ntwo options here i can get the x7 x drive 40i which is the 3.0 liter um turbo twin power turbo inline six \\ncylinder or i can get up to the m 50 i which is a 4.4 liter v8 look at that price jump though this one would \\ndrive i mean it would be amazing but i\\'m not going to do that i\\'m going to go here if i can keep this \\nunder 90 i feel like i\\'m winning so now you get into the different like l ook so you can either do this \\nluxury which obviously has like a lot of nice chrome detailing or you can go up to the m sport i mean \\nthat looks so much better look at the difference so i\\'m gonna go for the m sport because i just really feel \\nlike i need that  next we go to exterior bmw has some beautiful and i mean beautiful colors a lot actually \\nincluded in the m sport package so you guys know i love a blue car oh my gosh that\\'s basically carmon \\nblue very tempted to do that let\\'s look at like this gray i mean  that looks awesome i also like this carbon \\nblack metallic which is kind of like a dark navy oh my gosh how do i even choose what\\'s this one this \\none\\'s an additional am i gonna do this am i gonna be that out there no i\\'m not i\\'m gonna go for the \\ncarbon bla ck metallic i know you guys were all so invested okay then moving to the interior lots of fun \\n\\noptions um we\\'ve got the black we\\'ve got a coffee which is like a chocolate brown but i think this cognac \\nis beautiful it\\'s like the per it\\'s not too orange and then when i get into my different package options i \\ncan choose between the premium and the exec utive so i really like it because bmw has really simplified \\nit i do definitely want the heads -up display because like i\\'m in a bmw i feel like i just need that um and \\nthen i want the rear electric sun shades so i\\'m going to go for the premium i\\'m not going  to go up to the \\nexecutive so i\\'m just gonna select that okay so that brings my 2021 bmw x7 to an msrp of 81 150 which \\nis very expensive but oh my gosh look how cute love it  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW X7  \\nReview:  \\nare you looking to buy a fancy three row suv how fortuitous you clicked on this video this is the bmw x7 \\nit\\'s the largest vehicle bmw makes consequently there is ample room for adults in all three rows at least \\nassuming you\\'re an average sized human like m e i am five foot ten let\\'s make our way through all of the \\nrows in the front seat i can get into a very comfortable and commanding position yeah that\\'s nice \\nmoving to the second row by the way actually before we move to the second row check this out up her e \\non the b pillar it says x7 stamped into the sheet metal that\\'s kind of a nice little easter egg moving to the \\nsecond row the x7 has power second row seats that you can slide forward and you can recline which is \\nnice that\\'s actually pretty comfortable rec line there also point out that there\\'s a three seat bench or \\nsecond row captain\\'s chairs so that gives you either seven or six passenger max depending on which one \\nyou go with in fact let me move over here so you can get a better sense of how i fit head ro om is \\nexcellent i could probably move this front seat forward a little bit and have a little bit more knee space \\nbut i fit fine here i\\'m going to show you something maybe a little dismaying i\\'m pushing the button to \\nget into the third row let\\'s see how lon g it takes front seat\\'s moving forward this thing\\'s motoring that \\ndirection i\\'m aging before your eyes grizzled wrinkled i crawl into the third row okay again i could \\nprobably ask whoever\\'s here to move forward a little bit so my knees aren\\'t squeezed into  the seat back \\num but assuming they\\'re willing to give you a little bit more knee space this is comfortable um this the \\nheight between my feet and my butt is decent so i feel like i\\'m in a good position and the headroom \\nhere is great and i\\'ll also point ou t that the armrests and the cup rollers this is all soft and like stitched \\nand there\\'s real wood trim back here this is a pretty luxurious place for third row passengers normally \\nthis is all filled with plastic in lesser three row mid -size suvs but this is  i would say luxurious okay the x7 \\ncan haul people what about cargo behind the third row you\\'ve got a cozy little nook for cargo though \\nyou can expand that if you want pushing these buttons right here eventually the third row will motor \\nforward and you\\'ll have 48.6 cubic feet of space it takes a little bit of patience but eventually it gets \\nthere one thing i really do like about the cargo area though is the split hatch so the lower part lowers \\ndown and it gives you a place to sit to observe your children wh en they\\'re playing a sport you can \\nscream at them from here and then if you flip it up if you have canned items back here you\\'ll never \\nsacrifice a can of baked beans to the god of your driveway again and then you can close this right up \\nthat\\'s a pretty nea t hatch elsewhere the cabin indulges with fine materials and the technological \\ntrappings of luxury living ooh leather real wood trim and look an idrive 7 infotainment system you can \\ncontrol with this control knob or directly via the touchscreen the 12.3 in ch display looks great though \\nthe menu structure might take a little adaptation to get used to but if you don\\'t want to mess with any \\nof that you can also use your voice using bmw\\'s personal assistance technology hey bmw i\\'m tired hi \\nwhat can i help you wi th i\\'m tired pardon i\\'m tired date and time please continue using manual control \\nhere killer voice recognition your voice may vary a few minutes later hey we got the vitality program \\nrunning i said i\\'m tired and beyond bmw like turned on the discotheque mu sic you don\\'t need to go to \\nthe club you got an x7 it\\'s blowing wind on me and showing me a forest generic beats yeah well we\\'ve \\nall embarrassed ourselves enough i feel revitalized moving on to powertrains the base x -drive 40i we\\'re \\ndriving features a thre e-liter turbocharged inline six -cylinder engine with a mild hybrid system that \\nenables inoffensive automatic engine start stop functionality when the vehicle is motionless there\\'s also \\na more powerful 4.4 liter twin turbocharged v8 in the m50i that is unsu rprisingly less efficient what is \\nsurprising is that when it\\'s tuned for use in the alpena xb7 the 4.4 liter v8 has the exact same fuel \\n\\neconomy rating despite an obscene jump in power weird all x7 models include all -wheel drive a fine -\\nshifting 8 -speed automatic transmission and a 7 500 pound tow rating regardless of engine i\\'m driving \\nthe weakest version but flat foot acceleration feels pl enty eager brakes feel good too that eager spirit \\nwhen accelerating is also reflected in the x7\\'s handling mass has implications but even so the x7 steers \\nlike a bmw albeit a heavy bmw a motivated driver can tackle corners with commendable speed for \\nmaximu m fun use sport mode to firm the standard adaptive air suspension and lower the x7\\'s ride \\nheight you can also use the adjustable ride height to impress your neighbors assuming they find this \\nimpressive our tester also includes the dynamic handling package whose m -sport brakes and active \\nsteering further elevate the seven\\'s sporting prowess at a more relaxed pace ride quality is outstanding \\nwind and road imperfections are definitely obscured gifting occupants a serene cocoon in which to \\ncontemplate existence  and its purpose or lack thereof whoops got a little existential there better floor \\nto distract my brain and now let\\'s talk price for the kingly sum of 75 grand not including destination \\ncharges you can buy a base bmw x7 x drive 40i generously outfitted wi th 16 way heated front seats \\nheated armrests quad zone climate control a power tailgate apple carplay and android auto smartphone \\nintegration and a robust array of active driver

standard if you\\'ve ever had to supply your own refrigerant when \\nbuying a new car be sure to tell us in the comments among the countless optio nal features are heated \\nand cooled cup holders ventilated massaging front seats soft closed doors and a huge panoramic roof \\nspring for the driver assistance pro package and the x7 can manage the steering braking and accelerator \\nall by itself with vigilant human oversight of course how does the system work in the real world actually \\npretty well i haven\\'t hit anything yet adorned with the cold weather dynamic handling luxury seating \\nand executive packages our xdrive40i test vehicle lands at ninety six thousan d dollars choose the more \\npowerful x7m50i and the starting price is one hundred and one thousand dollars before options and if \\nyou go with the most elite alpena xb7 you\\'re gonna need at least 143 grand of course we can\\'t leave \\nwithout mentioning bmw\\'s gest ure controls if pushing a button or turning a knob seems too dignified \\ntry gesture controls i\\'m making it louder i\\'m going ahead of track or at least attempting to i\\'m turning it \\ndown oh that\\'s so much better than twisting a knob before flinging major leag ue coin at your nearest \\nbmw dealer you might also investigate competitors like the comparably pricey mercedes -benz gls class \\nor the notably cheaper audi q7 volvo xc90 or lincoln aviator alternatively the x7 smaller x5 kin is cheaper \\nand offers third row se ating but only if you view third row seats as an occasional use feature lastly if you \\nwant superior people hauling abilities with literally tens of thousands of dollars still in your pocket \\nsomething like the kia telluride sx prestige package could make se nse but if you demand a family wagon \\nmarked by engaging driving dynamics legit luxury and a price tag to match the bmw x7 could be a good \\nfit [Music] you  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW X7  \\nReview:  \\nhey everybody welcome back to the channel so I\\'m apologized in advance especially if you\\'re a first -time \\nviewer you\\'re going to think what\\'s wrong with audio um I actually flew in um I\\'m out of town for got \\nmy microphone unfortunately so when we\\'re reviewi ng this the best way I can with the GoPro mic so \\nhopefully that it um all right but this is a 2021 BW X7 um it has this is the x -drive 40i um it\\'s got the M \\nsport package you can see which M sport gives it that more of a sportier look um you lose a lot of that \\nthe aluminum Trim in place of now you get the black accents I think the M sport is the way to go and \\nlike you know I said it either one is fine but I think this is just looks the most aggressive in this um The \\nStyling here I would say this is a more p ronounced rope presence especially when you look at it from \\nthis view it just it just really just sort of has a commanding look even when you drive it it gives you that \\nthat dominant uh feel has a um is a little bit masculine but I can see definitely being  you know a car for \\nyou know all types First Impressions when I first jumped into it it is truly the seven series of SUVs it is \\nmassive I mean look how long that rear door is it is it is huge um you do have these 22 inch wheels and \\nit has the M Sport brake  calipers they\\'re in Black you can order them in blue and I think red not too sure \\n\\nabout the red but no blue you can get them in that color as well the cool thing about the X7 is it comes \\nwith a two axle air suspension standard so right now it\\'s sitting in its normal height you do have another \\nsetting that\\'s lower for sport mode you do h ave another setting for which is your sort of think of like \\nyour um entry and exit mode is if you have someone like for example my wife is short the lower mode \\nhelp her getting it out of the car loading things in and out of car will help and just like typi cal BMW X5 \\nfashion they also give you the split tailgate so let\\'s see that now so we\\'re going to open the tailgate \\nactually I need the key with me let\\'s get that obviously you get your BW key with the M sport you get \\nthe M Tri colors on here um lock and th ere\\'s fold you can unlock get your panic button attach and of \\ncourse like I said that\\'s not touch sensitive then of course too you can do a remote start I don\\'t know if \\nit\\'s even aggravated on this one but you can do remote start by pressing just three tim es in a row and \\nalso if you uh have the app you can remote start by activating the climate setting let me open the hatch \\nwith M sport you get the black exhaust tips this one does have a towing package was an option you get \\na I want to say this is a class t hree hitch from your class B Class 4 can\\'t tell um really can\\'t tell with these \\nthings but if we order it with the hitch um it\\'s a two inch receiver um you have your two ports you got \\nyour four pin and your seven -way harness so that\\'s something that um be nice to have looks like \\nsomeone nicked that right there um but yeah you do have those options as well obviously parking \\nsensors we can go in here all right so you get the option to have the suspension deflate itself and lower \\nitself to the slowest level um  so hit this now go ahead and drop itself to the lowest setting all right then I \\ncould open the tailgate power tailgate had it too it\\'s nice for you to sit on it things like that all right so \\nyou see here I got the stroller back here I\\'m gonna set that off  to the slide for now and then this \\numbrella all right so it\\'s got a Max setting so hit this it\\'s going to drop all the seats down you can see the \\nfront seat moves up as it pulls the seats down you see it I just press and hold that I gotta press hold it \\nthe whole time and it moves all the seats flat all this conquer room I\\'m gonna put that into the \\ndescription how much card room there is a lot they don\\'t go completely flat but there it goes good \\nenough to load something in here definitely a 65 inch TV to fi t back here just fine can I bring them back \\nup power there\\'s Max cargo now it\\'s the max position for this part yes I can bring up both there the \\nsecond row and the third row up and keep holding it and you can see it\\'s like that third row come up \\nand as a p osition to seats it moves the front seats out the way so the headrests don\\'t bump into the \\nfront seats so now if I just want to drop the second the third row hit these two I think if I close this one I \\nclosed the token individually you\\'re supposed to hatch  if I close the hatch to tailgate will shut itself all \\nright possibilities in this is endless this is one large check -in suitcase this is a medium check -in suitcase \\ngonna have a stroller up here if for example I wouldn\\'t need to use a third row the third r ow would be \\nup and these two suitcases should fit you know what actually they won\\'t fit because the third row is \\ngoing to be right here this line so maybe one of the large suitcases turned up on the side or maybe a \\ncouple of these but uh yeah a lot of room  in here you can do it I think with the third row you\\'re gonna \\nbe limited almost like most SUVs even something of this size um you still only you\\'re a company from \\nhere to here as far as space wise so here we are with the you know I\\'m assuming the third ro w be up \\nyou have this but again um limited as far as cargo room but then you also have option if you\\'re gonna \\ndo that good rooftop box mount it go from there because really I don\\'t really there\\'s not many SUVs out \\nthere who can offer a lot of different spa ce unless we get to like the extended little base Escalade or um \\nYukon XL or something like that where it\\'s going to have that extra extra room even when you get the \\nthird row up 91 octane is recommended 89 is uh minimum you can put in here here it is all season place \\nand the cargo room let\\'s see what\\'s back here oh there\\'s a cargo cover right there so you get the smart \\nkey access you lock the car from here both doors have it and then when you grab the inside of the door \\nhandle it unlocks soft closed doors same thing here soft close the clock and not gonna unlock so if I \\nneed to put the kids in first guess what I can grab this door handle open this door all right so I\\'m gonna \\nstart the backseat first let\\'s look at this you got two options you can do your typ ical does it one two oh I \\nguess you can see it\\'s in the back but I\\'m I\\'m guessing it\\'s a seven seater probably yeah it\\'s a seven \\nseater you got the two in the back that that three so tune it back and you have you can do an option \\nwhere you can captain seat s where you can do just make it a six -seater um if I were to do this I\\'d \\nprobably expect as a six seater you have your door control so here you can do the sun shade so the rear \\npassenger can control the sun shade here for the sunroof they also can control their um sunshade for \\n\\nthe window so actually I think this is opens the sunroof I just check this out let me get the back seat \\nlater on in the video oh there you go I just hit this button button lowered that sunshade this one raised \\nthat size shade all right so it\\'s like privacy  Shades here it\\'s cool and also these can be activated from the \\nfront driver area as well so this must be percent of what your car is not on um you do have power seats \\nin the rear like I said this is your discover series of SUVs so I would not expect anyth ing less than this I \\ncan\\'t running boards step in if you need to and you have eliminated um m logos for the door seal now if \\nsomeone jump in the back seat for example you got this button here which would then takes a second it \\nputs the front seat up first the process but it happens don\\'t worry be patient then the rear seat \\npassenger can climb in pull the seat up and it\\'s all done electronically there you go so I\\'m gonna jump in \\nhere and I\\'m gonna turn the car on before I completely do that they\\'re real all right okay now if I\\'m a \\nthird row passenger I jumped into the beer what\\'s next here how do I get the seat back I guess this I\\'m \\njust did my first time it\\'s your laying with me I\\'m looking around I don\\'t see anything let me hit that \\nbutton again on the side  at the seat which will be here let me hit the back one and here comes the seat I \\njust hope it doesn\\'t crush me back here but here it comes okay oh five foot agent eight inches all right \\nand this is me sitting back here um I could do maybe a couple hours a  couple hours max for me I just I \\nfeel a little bit claustrophobic in a sense because this seat is so high up for me um here back in here and \\nI\\'m just sitting here like okay I have a window okay a cup holders here um I do have a sun roof here and \\nlet\\'s che ck this out so you see my niece they\\'re not touching the seat is back not back that far it stopped \\nat a decent location you can see here in the front room that there\\'s room and I\\'m gonna jump in the \\nfront this second row so you can see how much room there is um but I do have a sunroof there\\'s a glass \\nI don\\'t know if it\\'s open it\\'s probably not but uh yeah you have your own climb control I have my own \\nheated seat back here so each person in here has his own outboard heated seat um honestly it is so that \\nwoul d say this is a five Zone climb control back in this total car over here you have a light reading light \\nand if I want if this shade is too much it\\'s like I could shut it just like that there you go so that will have I \\nmean I can tell it cool down just from  that shade it\\'s hot outside it\\'s this here is looks like a tie down and \\nUSBC port so cargo tied on USB super Port back here so I had to have bubbles if you know you have a \\nsmaller child or you know small teen or something like that I think they\\'ll be fine  with this cup holder \\ntablet or something like that I don\\'t know I guess I don\\'t know how you do in a longer trip like this \\nbecause there is a little bit of that classroom but I think that\\'s from any SUV with their row uh let me \\nknow what you think in the comments um there is an air vent open nose um so there\\'s airflow like I said \\nthen you you can do that which gives it more of a spacious look in here all right so to get out I\\'m gonna \\ndo the same thing I\\'m gonna press this oh you gotta be kidding me there i t goes I thought I was stuck in \\nhere for a second like I\\'m gonna open the door and get out all right okay door handle and now I\\'m here \\nrunning board does help because it\\'s a nice little step to get down so I\\'m not just stepping directly on \\nthe ground so I have that um do it from from this angle coming out of that rear third row you do need to \\nbe some of a um yoga does a bit of a stretch so I think it\\'s the one that\\'s uh have mobility issues maybe I \\nwouldn\\'t want to put them back here okay wait for this proc ess to happen again Okay jump into the \\nsecond row all right okay right away tell you something this pillow right here it feels nice man it feels \\nnice and let me see if I can now I\\'m sitting where it was in the third row where I had sitting lapse \\nposition b ut let\\'s see what it looks like here and this position here and I have plenty of leg room I have a \\nUSB C4 I\\'ll say there\\'s a place to attach devices um obviously the road window down raise it up but let\\'s \\nsee what this does okay so that can control the sun shade here in the pendant what the driver does so \\nthe driver I don\\'t know if they can override that I have to check the settings and see but the rear \\npassenger can shut that if they want and of course you can stop it anywhere you want it so I can say you \\nknow I want to stop it right there and that that\\'d be good halfway point maybe the driver says okay yo \\nagree we can share it you know you can close your side or whatnot or maybe you have a child in the \\nback and the sun\\'s declaring and you want to still have  something so I can shut that here and then I \\nthink this button I wonder if it opens the center let\\'s try it out no okay so this button controls the third \\nrow interesting okay so here in a second row no exceptions here you got obviously usb -c Port here two  \\nusb-c ports here 12 volt out lit socket right there a little pocket and here you got two um individual \\nclimate controls so then also individual heated seats so each app or passenger can get its own heated \\nseats air vent here okay one air vent back here al l right nothing on top you have reading light and in a \\n\\ndome light so once the Dome ones are reading look how much space from here look at the driver\\'s seat \\nhis head rest is up but look how much space there is for someone that\\'s tall it has to drive this they \\nwould have no issues drive this all right now let\\'s see how much legroom I can say like there\\'s nobody in \\nthe third row and I want to stretch out so let\\'s pull this back it\\'s power operate it I\\'m gonna go this back \\nas far as I can okay as far as it goes I want to recline as far as it reclines this would be something that I \\ncould definitely yeah let me see if I get an armrest there you go this is nice now for a road trip yes this \\nthis this would be comfortable I mean look how I mean I have all this room my feet are stretched out \\nbecause then I\\'m getting a fiv e foot eight um I mean I would like to see a little bit more recline um but \\nthis is obviously not the captain\\'s seats I wonder if the cap seats does more but this one would be man \\nthis would be something that you know as a you know younger my parents had s omething like this this \\nwould be nice something to have you know um I think there is a way to get some entertainment I think \\nfrom this view I would like a screen I think this I believe it is an option you can do your entertainment I \\nknow BMW is going away for that for the newer cars because they\\'re seeing it as something that people \\ndon\\'t order very much obviously with things of having tablets and smartphones um I can see why that\\'s \\nnot a thing but I wish BW was still offer it for those who want it um two c up holders back here and then \\nthe words right here not touching car seats easy access to the latch and obviously a car seat I mean \\nthere\\'d be no room there\\'d be no reason why a car seat could fit back here all right coming out of this \\none all right so here  I\\'m gonna show you a couple things here you have obviously the sun shades for the \\nrear um it\\'s hitting this raising lures both sides of the sun shades uh power windows power mirrors \\nthese are power 40 mirrors as well these mirrors also have blind spot mon itor there nothing that you \\nexpect for cars caliber um power open hatch tailgate area you see this number two this number two for \\nexample say for example I need to move this passenger seat up estimate reaching all the way across I \\ncan just activate this th en use my own stick control on my side and I can raise with the seat forward and \\nback and you probably ask why is that handy what if I need to put something back there what if I\\'m in \\nthe driver someone drop us in the back and or the kids are getting someth ing I\\'ll say hey I\\'ll put a seat \\nout don\\'t worry you know like I\\'m going to see that about the way um also your memory seats so I can \\neven set a memory on this side to all this signature preset and then I like to do that pressure for a car \\nseat of some typ e so I said okay this is the first that goes back I know this is my setting I think it\\'s stress \\nnumber two in this in that setting all right for rear you can do rear controls so if you\\'re gonna let people \\nin the back seat I can do um I can press this and I  can say for example I want the left seat to control \\npress and hold this and actually I put the left seat in so down my seat actually my driver\\'s seat just went \\nup a little bit and what that did is just um lets the person in the rear jump into the back oka y now it \\nmoved my seat up I guess you gotta be respecting that but if I need to come back down just press this \\nback and it will retract and then your driver\\'s seat should come back on his own there are different \\noptions obviously you have your light contro l this is a fully automatic headlight which means when I saw \\nabout foot automatic the headlights will activate automatically Dusk and Dawn when it\\'s raining outside \\nwhen wipers are on are low or automatic setting detects enough rain it will activate the he adlights for \\nyou the parking lights here you have Roadside marking here uh headlight activation right there and then \\nfog light right there all right off and then back to auto all right each time you turn the light on it gives \\nyou an indication lights for d are tells you to parking and the headlight is on if I just go to parking or if I \\ngo to fully headlight if I go to fog light you\\'ll see a fog light with that side of the indicator tells you what \\nthe 12 days are on okay Drive nice automatic um cruise control  you can set your cruise here activate the \\ncruise mode and then you can set your speed and then adjust your speed if you have the driver \\nassistance package then you can do adaptive and you\\'ll have adaptive setting limiter means that I don\\'t \\nwant to cruise control but just limit me for my speed so I can say okay I can set it to 80 and in that point \\nI can drive freely and then when I hit 80 feels like the car hits a governor in a sense now if I if I\\'m at 80 \\nmiles an hour and 50 or if I say like I said that 70 . it\\'s like that you know 70\\'s gonna speed but also I need \\nto pass on one well that limiter won\\'t limit you and say okay you can\\'t pass it will let you override it if \\nyou put the pedal down to the floor it will let you go beyond it because that\\'s telling y ou maybe you\\'re \\nin danger maybe you need to get around something quickly um it allow you to go beyond but most of \\nthe time limited is going to limit your speed so that way you don\\'t feel so controlled where you can \\nadjust it below the control but also make  sure you don\\'t have a heavy foot and this car is probably \\n\\nsomething you wanted in give you examples coming from the airport with this card and we\\'ll come back \\nfrom um from Raleigh and I was heading back you know um to my destination and I just looked down \\nand I was doing 90 miles an hour and I didn\\'t realize that  my wife didn\\'t realize it and I think I was just \\nkeep it just kind of going to flow you know in front of me and I didn\\'t realize just just the car just is super \\nquiet it\\'s really smooth and it\\'s something that I don\\'t it\\'s just something that it takes a m inute to get \\nused to so if you don\\'t know the car it\\'s easy just kind of slow creep up that stuff there um you got a \\nheated steering wheel um you have heated seats here for driver passenger there\\'s also a ventilated seat \\noption and we do heated seats you c an turn a heated armrest so just arm rests are also heated okay \\nobviously defroster controls air conditioning controls driver assistance controls you can do individual \\nyou can see until you can individualize so I can say okay what do I want that\\'s on like departure warning \\nfor Collision warning you know I have those things that are on um I could configure it and eventually I \\ncould have everything all on okay um you can go your menu controls for your air conditioning you can \\nchoose the air quality automatic recirculation so into the text um harmful fumes smog things like that \\nit\\'ll agree circulation once the air cleans up it will go to fresh air if it\\'s really hot outside for example the \\ncar is real hot inside so your carpet sit outside all day it will obviou sly recirculate it first and then once \\nthe air cools down outside it will go back to automatic and it does that without you knowing so it\\'s all \\nworking in the background Heating and ventilation you can do obviously control obviously the seats um \\nand then l et\\'s see here you can set different rules so what I say rules means let\\'s say for example it is \\nlike I said below anytime that\\'s below 40 40 degrees when I get into the car first thing turn on heated \\nseat turn on heated wheel right for example like that or  if you have a late seat option when it\\'s above \\nabove a certain temperature I won\\'t activate the ventilated seat and you can set that up any way you \\nwant it you can have it on or off certain temperatures anything between and that\\'s just so you have to \\nget into and always have to press here to see you know it\\'s automatically on and once the car warms up \\nit turns itself off there are different functions in here especially your color to size um it could park itself \\nautomatically so you have automated parking u m 360 camera which is nice you can turn the wheel this \\nway you know you got the guidance lines guidance markers which helps um you got your backup \\nassistant Backup Assistant you wonder what that is that it traces your path automatically when I so for \\njust for example um we have it on X3 I pulled into the garage I pulled hurt my wife\\'s car to garage that\\'s \\nactually it\\'s hers when I pulled the car into the garage I like to pull in close so I can open the doors or \\nboth sides she looked at it and she\\'s like how  I\\'m gonna get that thing out of there because you pulled \\nso close to the wall the mirror you know she\\'s worried about having hitting the mirror and things like \\nthat and I said don\\'t worry I said use your backup assistant because if I didn\\'t hit the mirror  coming in it \\nwon\\'t hit the mirror coming out it\\'s going to pull the exact same path that I pulled in so let\\'s try it out \\nand to turn that on the the steering wheel to control and it steered itself and it fault the exact path of \\ngetting out of the garage w ithout um hit anything as long as like I said if a car parked behind me I\\'m \\nsaying hit that but it was perfect for her to get in and out of the garage especially when if I parked it too \\nclose to the wall and so she had to do some maneuvering to get it out it just back that stuff out to where \\nthat path you still control the brake and accelerator pedal but you if the steering is automatically \\ncontrolled and you can see here it tells you how far the doors at their Max opening where the where \\nthey\\'re gonna hit so for example here it\\'s going to open just beyond that white line so if open the door \\nshould be just beyond that white line which is exactly where it\\'s telling me right um obviously get their \\ncamera views and then you have augmented reality so you can see  the of course you put automatic it\\'ll \\ntell you if you come down here you got your different modes sport mode now sport mode drop \\nsuspension you can see it here that light that second light is coming on just let me know the suspension \\nis dropping to the ne xt level uh Eco Pro adaptive function which means it just sort of predicts your \\ndriving style it just sort of based on how you drive it\\'s going to adjust it um automatic hold so now we \\nbreak that on when you stop it automatically turns on the automatic hol ds the brake pedal for you so \\nthink of it this way if you\\'re in a drive through or some type you don\\'t have to sit there and rest your \\nphone to break the whole time you can begin drive so I\\'m gonna drive and I\\'ll hit my foot off the brake \\nand it will not c reate it\\'ll sit there bright lights be activated it\\'ll hold itself and then for me to release it I \\njust have to accelerate pedal and you\\'ll see it release especially here in the car we\\'ll start the movies \\nnow I\\'ll say I can\\'t move because I\\'m in front of m e but just give you example anytime you want it you \\n\\ncan just go also anytime you see the park mode with the auto hold on it turns on the parking brake you \\ngot healed the second troll heel descent controls if you\\'re going down a steep hill um you want to \\ncontrol that speed instead of riding a brake you can j ust hit that on and think of a cruiser troll to not let \\nthe car roll too fast so I\\'m not saying we\\'re off -road but if you were going on a off -road or a grassy Hill it \\nwill control the speed it\\'ll control the ABS make sure you don\\'t do anything there um or if you\\'re just like \\nI said if I\\'m descending out of a steep parking garage or some type of Hill you can set the speed and it\\'ll \\nautomatic controller for you um you do have a wireless phone charger here um and then you have 12 \\nvolt Outlet which is being occ upied by radar detected right now and then you have a USBC USB a port \\nactually a cup holder heated and cold cup holders are available in this car and then let\\'s see I think that\\'s \\npretty much it for here this is something new for me is through the air susp ension so this these lights \\nare here tell the air suspension this is sort of your lower height this is only available when you\\'re \\nstopped helps when you\\'re getting in and out of the car so if I were to let\\'s say for example let\\'s say for \\nexample I um in th e lowest setting right now let\\'s get out the car and take a look how it looks in here \\nand right now I can see because I\\'m stepping out and it\\'s lower to the ground look how that looks nice \\nyou can drive like that huh it goes to a lower setting when you\\'re in a sport mode but not that long this \\nis a sport getting in and out so let\\'s do a quick walk around let\\'s go to um the highest setting the door\\'s \\ngonna be closed where to happen so as I do it you\\'ll tell me also so let\\'s go up to and you\\'ll see it here \\nlet\\'s go to the next one it\\'s pretty fast too I had this on my Audi Q7 which was nice so let\\'s um I\\'m in the \\nhighest setting this mode these these two high modes are available only for at lower speeds so now my \\nfoot barely reaches getting out of here not as tall as I thought I was expecting but I guess I needed to \\nclear an obstacle or some type I could I need to run over this parking block I could see who got the \\nactive drill starters so they\\'re open right now they\\'re taking more air so yeah that definitely c ould uh \\nhelp there I\\'m gonna go back to comfort mode I\\'m gonna see where that that position is I\\'m gonna see if \\nI\\'m watching from outside as well okay I\\'m gonna shut the door let\\'s see if it drops there it goes that\\'s \\nregular normal riding height all right  if I go to sport mode support mode isn\\'t going lower it does lower \\nitself support most low enough yeah that\\'s pretty cool so this is that sport mode right there all right so \\nlet\\'s do a quick walk around I\\'ll show you the lights all the lights I\\'m gonna do  this fast because it\\'s about \\nto rain all right so these are headlights put the fog lights on at night time there\\'s no mistaking that this is \\ndefinitely BMW that has the LED light there\\'s a laser light that\\'s an option and then the tail lights now \\nthe tail  lights are gonna be always on unless you turn off the Daytona lights yeah it still has that mean \\nstance from the back X5 like stance I always like the x5s have that that aggressive look there\\'s no \\nexception here all right let\\'s turn on the hazard lights i ndicators in the mirror as well foreign roadside \\nlights are helpful when you\\'re parking on the street um you can turn on the parking lights on one side of \\nthe other side of the car so example if I\\'m parked on the the right side of the street here um I can turn \\non the right the left side lights and then when I got the car the only so you see here we\\'re parked look at \\nthe left side the roadside lights on you can see here that only the left side is on there at a reduced rate it \\nsaves battery um and that\\'s just  so the car stays visible at night if I go back here back side you should \\nonly see the tail lights on the left side maybe hard to see in the daylight but you can see there the I can \\nsee that is on the left side tail light is on and then the right side is o ff okay I\\'m gonna turn off the car \\nyou\\'ll see these real shutters close and they\\'re shut all right that will change open and close depending \\non the needs especially when it\\'s on the highway if unless it takes enough air it\\'s going to shut itself for \\nmore a erodynamic needs if you\\'re stopped like I said for example this parking lot is opening something \\nto sucking more air to the fans all right so let\\'s move back here to the rear all right so come up top you \\nhave your um if you have your um garage controls you  have your sunshade here you can get it close so \\nsunshade I think this is for the rear yeah so when I close the rear and then you have one that closes the \\nmain you can open a sunroof you can hit this tilt it up or you can slide it back for a penny Center i f I wish \\nit this is a little bit disappointing that this is all that opens up this is all you get this it\\'s Fisher part of size \\nI\\'d rather have it half of the glass so that\\'s a little disappointing to see that um get the really light I do \\nlike the Alcantar a headliner I do I do I can appreciate that and then if I close the sunshade okay so not \\ncool stuff right there look this is an Alcantara though two times let\\'s open the hood let\\'s take a look at \\nthis engine this is your uh b -58 engine it is a inline 6 335  horsepower for this model 300 and I think it\\'s \\n30 I\\'m happy to work but it\\'s um I think for this one I look for like a little more power especially \\n\\nconsidering that this is a big heavy vehicle um it right now is is working um for it for example if you\\'re \\nnot like a power junkie or you don\\'t need it if you don\\'t need the power this engine would be fine but \\num I can feel it when it\\'s like some climbing a hill I notice it is downshifting a little bit more than I will \\nprobably what\\'s back with the V8 trade -off you get 20 V8 and then six cylinders this engine um like I said \\nit\\'s 335 horsepower it was a lot of the trade -off is going to be um you\\'re going to find that the gas \\nmileage is going to be great on this one so this one\\'s going to be 19 in the city and then it\\'s going to be \\n24 in the highway which is good for the all -wheel drive the upcoming all -wheel drive the V8 held at hand \\nyou do get more power so you get 523 horsepower but this fuel mileage is going to be at uh once I think \\nit\\'s at 15 City 21 on the highway so Highway that the city mileage is where it\\'s going to it\\'s going to \\nsuffer uh the ace owner is just gonna it\\'s just this thirsty engine um to wing capacity is going to be the \\nsame on each car no matter which engine you choose from and then when you get the hitch you lose \\nout of the kick the open tailgate so that\\'s something to keep in mind now to 0 -60 when I talk about the \\nengines this performan ce wise 0 to 60 is 5.8 seconds which is respectable but when you compare it to \\nthe eight cylinder 5.8 the V8 m50i is 4.5 so um that is a noticeable difference especially the six miles an \\nhour where that V8 is going to be at least a full second ahead and in  a continuity accelerate um but only \\nlike I said is on your driving style for me I know what I like but like I said not everybody drives like I do so \\num you know pick what you you know obviously get your budget and your needs and everything else I \\ndon\\'t th ink that this engine is bad I don\\'t think that this is a car slow I think anything usually in today\\'s \\nstandards as long as you have at least um a seven second or faster vehicle I think that\\'s plenty for most \\npeople\\'s needs C controls are here um you do hav e power um there\\'s a power nose manual thigh \\nextension uh I want to say maybe I think there\\'s a seat upgrade here don\\'t quote me I haven\\'t I think \\nthere\\'s a seat upgrade which gives you the power gives you a little bit more settings in here to adjust uh \\nraising this up and down lowers the headrest power headrests um basic controlled lumbar you can raise \\nand lowered lumbar um and then it\\'s lumbar control right there telescopic steering wheel um you do \\nhave automatic high beam and then you can cycle through d ifferent modes such as the mileage or \\nthings you want to see honey uh should the drive press this unlock come back and drive you can just go \\nneutral [Music] you can go over to sport mode with reverse and then presses it for Park you break \\nelectronic of cou rse the right height settings right there the correspondence all this out shut that it\\'s in a \\nconsole you got USBC port so I have this uh little compartment here no pedals the M sport they\\'re \\ncoming right here Harman Kardon sound system is standard Bowers and Wilkins is an upgrade all right \\nand of course here with the BMWs always you get soft control so I can assign these as shortcuts not just \\npreset for video I can do preset video if I like but I can have a shortcut take me to a navigation uh \\npreference se tting or radio preference setting or a typical screen or for example I don\\'t know why on my \\nBMWs I like to set the profile so I\\'ll have one profile for me I just hit that one profile for my wife hit that \\nnotes what they do is they um configure your ambient  lighting your seat Heating temperature in the car \\nMusic Choice it sort of can you\\'re seeing what basically how you\\'re feeling in it it\\'s not a tailored secure \\nmode um decided something else that we\\'ll touch in there too the driver corner and here it is op tion um \\nthese are SPF driver quarter is a cool feature think of it like if you have if you\\'re familiar with Tesla\\'s \\nsensory mode sup it doesn\\'t record when the car\\'s parked but for example when you get to an accident \\nit can take the footage from the from t he past like a couple minutes and it uses the cars 360 cameras to \\nrecord the footag  \\n \\nCar Model : 2023 BMW X7  \\nReview:  \\n[Music] hi guys i\\'m henry and you\\'re watching car wheels today we have two bmw suvs for you the bmw \\nx7 and the bmw x5 and we\\'re going to talk a little bit about the differences but mostly we\\'re gonna \\nfocus on the x7 because i think it\\'s an excellent utilit y vehicle bmw finally thinks about the people that \\nare not just behind the steering wheel but also the people in the back [Music] so this car is actually so \\ntall i don\\'t have to get down to show you guys the grill is massive it\\'s not the same shape and siz e as the \\nnew 4 series and m3 and 4 that\\'s coming out but it\\'s still quite ginormous i like it in black it\\'s a little bit \\nmore sleek in the x5 it\\'s chromey and it doesn\\'t look as good as it does in black it has the bmw laser \\n\\nheadlights which look quite nice and generally the bumpers have very very very similar shapes but the \\nx7 is slightly bigger the hoods also have very similar shapes and that\\'s because they are the same car \\nunderneath they have the same engine 333 horsepower  and 330 foot pounds of torque i think bmw is \\nhiding the true horsepower numbers because these cars really move much better than the power would \\nsuggest they\\'re really quite heavy this car is roughly around 5000 pounds it starts at 4800 pounds uh \\nwith almo st no options and this is almost a base car and it\\'s still quite heavy the x5m competition it\\'s \\nreally up there at 5500 pounds almost this is even heavier i mean it\\'s heavier because it\\'s loaded with \\ntech it\\'s got a third row which is extremely useful we\\'r e gonna get to that later now let\\'s explore the \\nsides of these cars the x7 is quite a long vehicle it\\'s a very interesting vehicle up until here they look \\nalmost identical once you start moving back the x5 has a very sporty rear end and it looks really nic e the \\nx7 it\\'s not that it doesn\\'t look nice but it loses a little bit of a sporty flare it loses a little bit of bmw nest \\nin some ways it\\'s not necessarily a bad thing because it\\'s not meant to be super interesting in the back \\nbut it does have bmw design l anguage the exhaust tips are identical on both cars i do like that these \\nexhaust tips are black and they\\'re not chrome the black on the black trim really sort of accentuates the \\ncar makes it a little sleeker makes it a little bit more pleasing to look at n ow let\\'s start this car from the \\nback to the front the tailgate it has a split opening and i really really do like that now this may seem like \\na small trunk and this is loaded with a solar panel to charge the batteries it has some mats here that the \\ndealer  has put in the back because it is winter still and i do like that everything closes with a touch of a \\nbutton now the trunk may seem small with the with the third row up but once the third row goes down \\nit is really quite massive now moving to the back hug e door it is a good thing that is ginormous because \\nit gives you very easy entry to the rear of this car now let\\'s go in the car and is just huge i have set up \\nthe front seat as my driving position and i\\'ve even moved it back a little bit because i\\'m not a  big guy at \\n510 i\\'m not very tall and i don\\'t take up a lot of space and i kind of like to sit close to the steering wheel \\nso i move the seat back for a little bit more comfort and i have a huge amount of space here a huge \\namount of headroom the sunroof it \\'s basically got three sunroof guys and it it\\'s like it\\'s like daytime in \\nhere and we\\'re indoors and it still feels like i have so much light in here it does have a captain\\'s chair \\noption which is around 800 and it is absolutely worth it so getting inside this car getting inside this car is \\nreally not all that difficult now this these seats are painfully slow like you just really need to sit here for a \\nlong time as they go up still here still here still here all right let\\'s go inside in the backseat this is  the \\nhighlight feature of the x7 bmw for the first time has not only thought about the driver in the front seat \\nand maybe the front passenger they\\'ve actually thought about the rear seats in this car and what a rear \\nseat it is we had a guy who\\'s six to com e in here and sit beside me we did not rub shoulders we had leg \\nroom we had headroom we had space for our hands this car has a cup holder it even has nice trim that \\nfollows through with the rest of the theme of the car and once you bring the seat back do f orgive it it is \\nquite slow and don\\'t think that you actually have to use things by hand there are buttons right here that \\nyou can control everything with i\\'m in here i have space i have headroom look how much headroom i \\nhave look at how much space is in he re this is absolutely incredible and yeah that if i have one complaint \\nabout this car is the fact that this seat does move very slow but i i i will forgive it because the space in \\nhere is unreal it is incredible i can\\'t stress enough if anybody needs an su v with a third row seat this is \\nthe suv for you full stop i have never been in the back of an suv in the third row that has as much space \\nas this car has now moving up to the front the front of every bmw is always special because bmw \\nprimarily cares about the person behind the steering wheel as a passenger here i feel like i have slightly \\nless space than the person all the way to the back sure i have good visibility but it feels a little bit more \\ncramped maybe than the x5 just because it has to have had a l ittle bit of space given to the rear you \\ncan\\'t make this car look like a train so it\\'s still it\\'s still spacious don\\'t get me wrong but it\\'s it\\'s bmw \\ngiving some priority to the rear seats and i really like that because that\\'s the actual purpose of this \\nvehicle to split the space between all three rows in a way that everybody feels relatively comfortable \\nthrough here bmw design language they almost all look the same there\\'s nothing wrong with that i kind \\nof wish it was a little bit more distinguished but it  is a nice place to be the materials are super premium \\neverything feels very good the seats are very comfortable obviously there\\'s absolutely nothing sporty or \\nracy about this suv it does drive sporty enough for somebody who wants to enjoy giving it some t hrottle \\nhere and there but generally speaking this car for everyday usage is perfect for a third row seat suv is \\n\\nperfect i really do like this engine some people do suggest you get the the stronger v8 engine but the \\nstraight six in this car is plenty of power is silky smooth it drives really well it does roll a little bit but \\nthat\\'s perfect because it means that the compromise is a very soft comfortable ride and that\\'s exactly \\nwhat you need in an suv like this okay so the front seat in here let\\'s start this thing it\\'s very smooth and \\nsoft the bmw noises are are classic it has all the gestures and it has all the featur es that you\\'d want it is \\nfully loaded top to bottom with bmw tekken here i am quite fond of bmw interiors because they are a \\nlittle bit more simple than other vehicles in audis things are sort of hidden under menus in here you \\nhave the eight preset shortcu ts which look like radio buttons i know they double up as other features \\nbut this doesn\\'t feel very modern to me i kind of hope bmw soon changes this layout and this format in \\nhere the cup holders in this are excellent it\\'s one of the only german cars that \\'s sort of starting to show \\na lot of attention to the cup holders and their placement the stuff down here is very good you have \\nsport you have comfort you have eco pro you have adaptive and this car has a cool extra feature which \\nraises and lowers the heig ht of this car at its very lowest this car is extremely easy to go in and out of \\nyou don\\'t get that weird step that you sometimes feel just brushing up against your leg as you leave in \\nthe lowest setting you can sort of almost walk out of this as if it\\'s a  car in its highest setting it really is \\nreally tall and it feels like it can go in places that normal suvs can\\'t normally reach five different settings \\ni\\'m not sure if it needed five i think i would have been okay with three settings but it has five if yo u \\nreally are very specific and it\\'s as easy as pressing a button down here bmw center screen is excellent it \\nis really quite large and i am a huge fan of how the display is it has a lot of features i will show you guys \\nsome of its more in -depth features th rough here uh if you go to car it basically gives you all the \\ninformation you\\'d want you have the flow of the power and the engine you have an x -view which sort of \\ngives you which ride height you\\'re in and the compass it has the sport displays and you can see your g -\\nmeter you can see your your psi your temperatures how much torque and horsepower it\\'s using i\\'m not \\nsure if this is all that accurate but you know it it it\\'s there if you really needed it i\\'m not sure you\\'d really \\nwant it in this car this is pro bably the thing you\\'d want the most in this car which is the fuel mileage now \\nthis car is decently good with fuel consumption because of bmw\\'s way of managing torque down low i \\nthink it\\'s really nice the way this car has torque at the at the earlier on rpm  so you don\\'t really need to \\npush the throttle all the way down to sort of get the car moving it\\'s a big car and you want the torque to \\nbe right at the lower rpm so it gets going easily and this car does that going through more through more \\nsettings we hav e sort of service engine oil tire pressure you know the generic car informations and then \\nwe you can control pretty much everything you\\'d want in here it does have a fancy key if you really \\nwant this car doesn\\'t have that option but you can buy the fancy k ey this car has the standard bmw \\ninfotainment system and it\\'s quite easy to use and i really do like it the menus are really easy to navigate \\nthe parking sensors in this car they\\'re not the fancy equipped 360 cameras that you can move the car \\nabout like we  showed you guys in the x5m a couple of weeks ago if you want to see that video click up \\non the pop -out banner right now it\\'s really quite a fantastic car and we\\'d really recommend you guys go \\ndrive one of those sitting in here feeling the steering wheel t he paddles feel really premium everything \\nfeels really premium this steering wheel is very familiar it\\'s very very much the same steering wheel as it \\nis in the x5 very similar in feel to the x5m it just doesn\\'t have the same stitching it doesn\\'t have the m  \\nblue and red stitching across but it still feels very nice the view out of here it\\'s a nice view the side \\nmirrors are a little bit small and they are small in basically all of the bmw suvs it\\'s not necessarily a \\ncomplaint because it\\'s still got very good visibility but it feels like they could have been a bit bigger or at \\nleast the inner glass portion could have been a bit bigger there\\'s very little complaints about this car the \\nonly things you might not like about it are things that are subjective like it s looks or maybe you want a \\nlittle bit of more modern interior like audi\\'s multiple screen setup other than that this car i just see i just \\nsee very few flaws with it the one thing that i do dislike about this car is the way the doors close they\\'re \\nvery la rge and not having a soft closing feature i have found myself trying to close the door multiple \\ntimes and it\\'s just hard to close on a first try it feels like you sort of have to slam it a little bit in a luxury \\ncar that feels a little bit counter -intuitiv e but minor complaint the rest of the car is excellent the the the \\nroof liner is excellent the materials in here are excellent this car overall oozes sort of luxury and and \\nexcellence and it drives very silky smooth this is one of my more preferred suvs wh en it comes to third \\nrow cedars with seven seats i know this car is equipped with a captain chair so it only has six seats but it \\n\\ncan comfortably sit six adults and i will take that over the middle seat which you will use in rare \\noccasions and if you\\'re gonna use that seat in rare occasions might as well have the captain chairs \\npeople will enjoy sitting here much better than being cr amped with those other seats also makes \\ngetting in and out of the back much much easier the seats are slow but it d they do make life much \\neasier going all the way to the back at the back here you can actually control the seats manually so if \\nyou want a ma ximum amount of people you can put all the seats up if you want the maximum amount \\nof cargo you can actually press the space for cargo and all the seats will go automatically down and give \\nyou a very very very large trunk here with just a touch of a button  now let\\'s go check out the x5 not \\nhaving the rear seats this trunk is massive and it\\'s quite useful and this is even more useful it\\'s got a very \\nvery durable material here which is a very nice touch from bmw it\\'s just massive and i can see why \\nyou\\'ve had so much space for the other seats in the x7 a little bit of a longer car there\\'s just so much \\nspace in here and it\\'s a very usable trunk this is a very usable suv if you don\\'t need space if you don\\'t \\nneed more than five seats and you want to save yourself some money this car drives a little bit better \\nthan the x7 so i want to say if the space is not a priority for you this might be the better suv [Applause] \\nsitting in this car there is almost no difference i feel like i\\'ve just moved on to a different bmw t he \\nseating position feels the same the mirrors are the same the steering wheel is the same the displays are \\nthe same the center console is the same it\\'s missing the the ride adjustment because this car doesn\\'t \\nhave it it doesn\\'t feel any more cramped in he re and that\\'s because bmw has used space well in the x7 it \\nfeels very premium to be in here just as it does in that vehicle and there\\'s really not much more you can \\nsay about the x5 compared to the x7 other than the fact that it doesn\\'t have the same amoun t of room \\nin the back it has a ginormous trunk it\\'s extremely usable and it just doesn\\'t have that third row \\notherwise it\\'s essentially a very very very similar suv this does drive sportier it is much lighter it is better \\nin the corners you will feel that every single day so sport is a little bit something that you want out of \\nyour everyday drive ability this is the suv for you this is definitely much easier to park this is much easier \\nto live with because it\\'s not so tall and it\\'s not so long so it\\'s reall y a personal preference and it does \\nsave you quite a bit of money this car equipped similarly you\\'re gonna look at anywhere between 20 to \\n30 thousand dollars in savings with this vehicle over the x7 now if i am being completely honest with \\nyou having the s ame features other than the ride height change and the rear seat trickery and maybe \\nthe extra sunroof that is in that car but you don\\'t need it in here because it would just be over the trunk \\nit\\'s just simply i fail to see that necessity for the x7 if you don\\'t need the space 20 000 plus dollars is \\nquite a lot of money to save and you get essentially a sportier suv so if that\\'s something you care about \\nthe x5 is for you and if you really want to go all out and get the sportiest version of this car the x5m i s \\nfor you and that is an incredible vehicle [Applause] all right guys so to conclude the differences between \\nthe x7 and the x5 are essentially after the front cabin and back so if you really want space this is the one \\nto get if you want a little bit of spo rt and you want a little bit of drivability was still with a good amount \\nof utility the x5 will also do the job this is a slightly less expensive suv but it still offers the exact same \\npremium quality as the x7 so it\\'s really a personal preference or maybe  you must have the third row \\nseating and therefore the x7 would be the better suv for you i do like the looks of both of these suvs \\nthey are very similar they have the essentially the same essence they are very bmw interiors are nearly \\nidentical if not com pletely identical and i want to say i\\'m pleasantly surprised with the x7s rear seating \\nspace it was mind -blowing and i really really urge you guys to go take a look at this car if it\\'s something \\nthat you\\'re interested in if it\\'s if it\\'s the third row seat is important to you definitely give yourselves the \\nchance to go look at one of these because they are absolutely incredible machines thank you so much \\nfor watching please like and subscribe don\\'t forget to comment below i really quite like the x7 and this \\ngrill on the x5 is not doing it justice but in a nice trim the x5 looks really really sharp so see you guys next \\nweek [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign  \\n \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2021 F -Pace  \\nReview:  \\n\\n[Music] hello and welcome back to another video from auto social uk back in 2016 when jaguar  \\nlaunched the f -pace it was considered a bit of a risk for jaguar to release an suv but since that time it\\'s  \\nbecome the jaguar\\'s fastest selling product selling nearly quarter of a million worldwide and it\\'s easy to  \\nsee why this car offers so much practicality but still has that classic really timeless jaguar styling if you  \\nlike new car reviews and you\\'re just finding my channel now then please don\\'t forget to go ahead and  \\nhit the subscribe button i\\'d love to have you join me on my channel okay let\\'s get int o the rest of the  \\nvideo the jaguar f -pace has had a well -needed revamp for 2021. the exterior already looked great  \\nhowever they\\'ve just had some design tweaks which has elevated it further they\\'ve also made some  \\nchanges on the interior which have made a huge amount of difference which i\\'ll go into later starting off  \\nwith the bonnet this has now a much more aggressive hump and also on the previous car it used to  \\nhave a bonnet shut around here which was a little bit unsightly however they\\'ve now brought it fo rward  \\nand it has a much more sleeker seamless design as you can see the bonnet does also overhang the  \\nlight slightly and gives it a more aggressive look you know like a race me face you know like okay that  \\nwasn\\'t the best race face but you get what i\\'m trying to say they also have some redesigned front  \\nheadlights which now feature a double j on the previous cars they just had a singular j and these look  \\nreally good this car is actually fitted with the black pack which is around 650 pounds but completely  \\nchanges  the style of the car you\\'ve  got a black  front grille  you\\'ve  also got the black  surround  of these  air \\nvents and also a black gloss front splitter in my opinion this is the best view of the jaguar f pace it really  \\ndoes look sleek and stylish unfortunately that black pack might be quite good value for money at 615  \\npounds but if you also wanted privacy glass that\\'s going to cost you a further 415. around the back the  \\ndesign changes have continued and you no longer have some physical tailpipes because jacki e will  \\nwant to come across as a much cleaner brand after all they say that they\\'re going to be completely  \\nelectric by 2025. you\\'ve also got some redesigned rear lights which have been taken from the jaguar  \\ni-pace convenience is key with an suv and the r -dynamic se does come standard with an electric  \\ntailgate the f -pace\\'s boot boasts 613 liters which is bigger than the mccanns and only 20 liters smaller  \\nthan you\\'ll find in the porsche cayenne from the class above the facelift has also brought a new engine  \\nlineup including three diesels ranging from 161 brake horsepower to the car that i have today which  \\ngets 204 brake horsepower to a three liter six cylinder with 296 brake horsepower there\\'s also three  \\npetrols in all including a plug -in hybrid most of the engines other than the plug -in are also now mildly  \\nelectrified inside of the f -pace is where we\\'ve seen the most change and it\\'s showcased by this 11.4  \\ninch touchscreen now previously the system in the jaguar f -pace was a little lacking it was slightly laggy  \\nand it was just lacking in all the equipment that you get in modern cars however this system is  \\ncompletely different so this is actually the pivi pro system that you get in the new land rover defender  \\nand it really  is a great  system  it\\'s super  crisp  as you can see i\\'ve got the 3d map showing  at the moment  \\nyou\\'ve also got all of your apple carplay and android auto as you\\'d expect but you\\'ve also got the 360 \\ndegree cameras which really are quite fancy and especially for when parking with such large wheels  \\nthese  are really  handy  to make  sure that you can zoom  in and you\\'re  not going  to hit any of those  alloys  \\ndespite the fact that this screen has been chemically strengthened and also has a dual coating of  \\nanti-glare to reduce fingerprints you do still get a lot of fingerprints so you\\'re going to want to keep a  \\nlittle cloth in the car to always be wiping it clean jaguar say that the new system on this pivi pro 2.0  \\nmeans that everything up to 90 of it is found with just two clicks away and it is a lot quicker and more  \\nresponsive the interior quality of the jaguar f -pace has also improved sufficiently you\\'ve got lots of new  \\nmaterials including a lot of this chrome almost steel fill which i really like there\\'s a  really good weight to  \\nthe paddles which is really enjoyable you\\'ve also got some steel across the center console mixed in  \\nwith some levers of course you\\'ve got some really nice soft levers across the dash and on the steering  \\nwheel but if you delve a little bit deeper then you do start to find some scratchy plastic but at least it\\'s  \\nhidden one thing i found a little bit strange and it took some getting used to is when you first see this  \\nlittle screen  at the bottom  here it looks  like it should  be touch sensi tive however  i was prodding  at all of  \\n\\nthese buttons and nothing was really happening i thought it was broken after talking to jaguar they\\'re  \\nactually touch sensitive so you have to apply some pressure once you apply some pressure it will bring  \\nup all of your settings  you also will need  to twiddle  these  dials to change  your temperature  but pull them  \\nout to change your fan speed which i think if you don\\'t have that explained to you it might be a little bit  \\ndifficult  to find the car doesn\\'t  come  standard  with an electric  sunroof  and you have  two options  you can \\nhave a standard sunroof or you can have this one which is electronically sliding now this is a 1600  \\npound option but i definitely think it\\'s worth having especially when you have the dark headlining it just  \\nbrings a lot of light into the cabin and makes it feel a lot more spacious so what has chan ged about the  \\nnew f -pace well mainly they\\'ve scrapped a few options so you can no longer get the entry -level \\nrear-wheel drive they\\'re all now four -wheel drive and you also can no longer get the manual gearbox  \\nthey\\'re all fitted with the eight -speed zf gearbox as i mentioned previously the car that i\\'m driving is  \\nfitted with the d200 engine which is a two liter four -cylinder turbocharged diesel producing 204 brake  \\nhorsepower now this car seems to have a little bit of a split personality because when i was first driving  \\nit at low speeds it felt a little bit underwhelming there didn\\'t seem to be much power beneath my  right \\nfoot but that\\'s because i wasn\\'t applying it particularly strongly as soon as you are a bit firmer with that  \\nright foot the car just completely changes its personality it goes from being a really soft kind of quiet car  \\nto quite  an aggressive  car that deals  really  good  with your inputs  my only advice  is that if you are gonna  \\npick a car i probably wouldn\\'t go for the entry level diesel engine it has around 150 brake horsepower  \\nand i just don\\'t think it would be enough to lug such a large car because every version is now fitted with  \\nfour-wheel drive this is sure to help in slippery conditions should you find yourself in a grass car park or  \\nwintry weather and while the f -pace isn\\'t really meant for off -road driving jaguar have been able to  \\nborrow  a lot of know -how from sister  brand  land rover  still the jaguar\\'s  limited  road cleara nce large  alloy \\nwheels and sporty tyres mean that the discovery sport is probably going to be a better bet if you live  \\nsomewhere really rugged despite the fact that all of the cars are now fitted with a four -wheel drive  \\nsystem the jaguar f -pace won\\'t use that unless it feels like the extra grip is needed most of the time it\\'s  \\ngonna behave like a rear -wheel drive car although a hundred percent of the car\\'s power can be sent to  \\nthe front wheels if needed the development work that jaguar have performed on the f-pace\\'s  \\nsuspension has definitely paid off as potholes and poor road surfaces are noticeably smoothed out it  \\nalso grips exceptionally well with a satisfying precision to the turn -in and decent feedback through the  \\nwheel of course it\\'s not the most extreme on the rails suv that you can buy but it\\'s also not overly soft  \\nit\\'s just a beautifully assured all -rounder both this jaguar f -pace and also the xf scored really highly in  \\nthe end cap independent  crash  testing  and that\\'s  mostly  due to the strong  bodywork  and also the whole  \\nhost of safety equipment that\\'s on offer those include things like traffic sign recognition lane departure  \\nwarning and autonomous emergency braking the f -pace also makes a pretty good tow vehicle it can  \\ntow up to 2400 kilograms which is about enough for a large caravan although that will reduce to 2000 if  \\nyou go for the plug -in p400e model once again jaguar blow me away with just how timeless but also  \\nmodern and exciting their cars can be and all things considered when you compar e this to some of the  \\ncompetitors i think it\\'s  great value for money  and talking about competitors  jaguar marshall ipswich  \\nwant me to invite you to an event on the 3rd of june where they\\'re going to have all of their competitor  \\ncars to pin against their jaguars just to prove to you why you should buy a jaguar so if you\\'ve been  \\nconsidering between certain brands then why not get down to that event and test them all at the same  \\ntime i\\'ll pop the details in the description box if you\\'ve enjoyed this video plea se go ahead and give it a  \\nmassive thumbs up and if you want to see more content like this hit that subscribe button thank you so  \\nmuch for watching until next time bye [Music] you  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2021 F -Pace  \\nReview:  \\ni\\'m tom baker this is chasing cars and this is the facelifted jaguar f -pace a vehicle that i personally think  \\nis one of the best -looking suvs on the road the jaguar f -pace has really turned around the fortunes of  \\n\\nthe jaguar brand since this crossover launched several years ago it is by far the most popular vehicle  \\nthat jaguar  has built in the last decade  and even  though  this brand\\'s  slinky  sedans  and two-door coupes  \\nand convertibles are really where my particular heart lies the f -pace is a very good mid -sized luxury suv  \\nas we\\'ll find out later in today\\'s video it\\'s a good car to drive and now thanks to the 2021 facelift i think it  \\neven looks a touch better outside and the interior is a more sumptuous place to spend time as well now  \\nthe bug bear with owning  a jaguar  at least  here in australia  has always  been  that the warranty  has been  \\na little bit shorter  than some  rivals  particularly  since  mercedes -benz  moved  to a five-year warranty  more  \\nthan a year ago well jaguar land rover are now doing exactly the same thing this car comes with a  \\nfive-year warranty and five years of roadside assist included so i think that gives you just that little bit of  \\nextra peace of mind to buy into something a little bit more left field which i think is what a jaguar f -pace  \\nkind of is compared  to a mercedes  glc or an audi q5 or you know  the cars are a little bit bigger  than that \\nas well so we\\'re going to take a look in the cabin we\\'re going to have a look at the boot and then we\\'ll  \\ntake this f -pace out onto the road to see what jaguar\\'s largest suv is like to drive but before we get  \\nstarted make sure to hit subscribe  down below if you haven\\'t  already the refreshed exterior of  the \\njaguar f -pace is really quite subtle and that makes sense because this was already a great looking suv  \\nin my books but the interior was starting to get tired and that\\'s been addressed in the 2021 changeover  \\nto the f -pace basically the entire dashboard shape has been redone and that\\'s unusual for a facelift it\\'s  \\nactually quite a costly change but in this case it actually really benefits the jaguar f -pace now the  \\nstandard item is this new slate touchscreen which gets closer to a square format if not quite entirely  \\nsquare it\\'s really snappy it\\'s what jlr call their pv pro system you can see it responds to the touch  \\nrelatively well you can pair up your phone with bluetooth there isn\\'t wireless apple carplay or android  \\nauto we do have those technologies via usb cable and it works really well with such a large canvas on  \\nthis display now there\\'s still a pretty cool trick climate control system d own here where you push and  \\npull the controls to change things like your temperature your fan speed heated seats and the like that  \\nworks quite well you also get this new uh steering wheel that\\'s already been seen in the refreshed xe i  \\nthink it looks really great love this small little airbag cover now the actual buttons themselves don\\'t  \\nalways  respond  perfectly  to the touch  i found  myself  having  to hit the next track  button  a couple  of times  \\nhere and there but eventually it gets through and then we look through on this particular car at a fully  \\ndigital  instrument  cluster  that\\'s  very configurable  you can put media  trip computer  information  a full map \\nin there  you really  can do whatever  you like which  is pretty  great  and quality  feels  excellent  in here both \\nin terms of the materials that have been used which all feel pretty plush but also the way the car is  \\nscrewed together if you go looking for them you will find a few creaky noises in some of the  \\ncomponents that move but it\\'s really nothing more than what you\\'d expect to find in an audi q5 or q7 for  \\nexample so i don\\'t think it\\'s really a detractor for the f -pace comfort is great even on the base seat it\\'s  \\nreally  sumptuous  really  comfortable  and supportive  but if you upgrade  to these  18-way adjustable  seats  \\nyou get things like inflating bolsters and a thigh extender that will let you really find the most ideal  \\ndriving  position  now this car is elegantly  specified  in navy  blue outside  over this very light cream  leather  \\nand open pour wood trim and the good thing about the f -pace is it\\'s actually a lot more customizable  \\nthan rival vehicles in terms of colors and specs so you don\\'t have to get a black pack you can most of  \\nthe cars on today\\'s launch of the f -pace had it but this one is more traditionally specced and i think it  \\nactually comes up really nicely you can also go for blacks inside or a tan or this cream there are other  \\nchoices too and later when the svr hot version arrives it\\'ll have a really focused cabin now in terms of  \\npracticality we\\'ve got wireless smartphone charging that actually holds the phone and works w hich isn\\'t  \\nalways the case with wireless charging big cup holders an adjustable armrest with a big box and two  \\nusb ports both the new style and the old style and large door bins too so up front there\\'s really quite  \\nlittle to fault about the updated f -pace here in the back of the f -pace it\\'s a good opportunity to remind  \\nourselves of what this vehicle\\'s competitors actually are and a bit like the lexus rx the jaguar f -pace is  \\nsomething of an in -betweener it\\'s a little bit bigger than a mercedes glc but smalle r than a gle and the  \\nsame  goes  for the bmw  x3 and x5 so you\\'re  getting  a relatively  big medium  suv if that makes  sense  and \\nthat does mean that the f -pace is only a five -seater if you\\'re looking for a seven seater jaguar can\\'t help  \\nyou but you will be able to step across  the showroom  floor into something  like a range  rover  sport  which  \\nyou can get with a third row or even the smaller land rover discovery sport although the third row in that  \\ncar is a massive  punish  here in the jag what  you get is a generously  proportioned  five-seat car so in the \\n\\nsecond  row you will be able to get adults  in without  too many  complaints  for myself  at six foot headroom  \\nis no issue even though this car is optioned with a very large panoramic sunroof legroom behind the  \\ndriving position is generous i\\'ve got several inches toe room is great as well because there\\'s a cut out  \\nbeneath the seat now the middle seat is a little bit of a perch and the tunnel in the floor is quite high but  \\nthe actual footwells themselves are pretty big so i think you could actually get someone in the middle if  \\nyou needed to plus the amenities back here are okay we\\'ve got air vents keep the air flowing on a hot  \\nday heated outboard seats in the rear always a luxurious touch on a cold morning those so ft materials  \\nand stitch leather in the back continue from up front as does the open pore wood trim very nice and  \\nalso the intricate grilles for the meridian sound system that you get at this level in the range there\\'s also  \\na flip down armrest with two cupholders and map pockets on the back of the seat although if you\\'re  \\nlooking  for usb ports  in the back  you won\\'t  find them  there\\'s  only a 12 volt socket  moving  around  here to \\nthe back of the updated jaguar f -pace you\\'ll need to be a jag fan to spot the differ ences with the  \\nfacelifted  car because  they are quite  subtle  but they are absolutely  there  the new tail light design  kind of \\nmatches the slimmer headlights which i think have actually helped the car there\\'s also subtle changes  \\nto the bumpers and some new alloy wheel designs including the 21 inch wheels optioned up onto this  \\nd300se that i\\'m driving here now you do get a power tailgate as standard that operates quite promptly  \\nand gets out of your way and it reveals a decently practical 650 liter boot now as you can see it\\'s really  \\nsquare the load height isn\\'t too high it\\'s also not that low not as low as the xf sport brake was for  \\nexample but you will get several large suitcases in without too much of an issue a few clever touches  \\ncargo blind gets up and out of your way so you don\\'t have to keep moving it underneath the boot floor  \\nyou get a spare wheel which gives you a bit of confidence for country touring what we also have is  \\nsome netting over here for delicate stuff a couple of hooks so that your bags don\\'t flop around 12 volt  \\nsocket tie down points we don\\'t get remote releases to drop those back seats from the boot that\\'s one  \\nthing that would be convenient also there\\'s no lock button on the tailgate so you do have to close it and  \\nthen lock the car which i think most people will be able to cope with but some rivals have integrated a  \\ndual button all right let\\'s look at the practicality let\\'s now head out onto the road so what\\'s the updated  \\njaguar f -pace like to drive well with any facelift there\\'s never going to be a radical change to the driving  \\ndynamics of a car but in the case of the f -pace that\\'s a good thing because jaguar had a lready  \\napproached  this suv when  they developed  it to be one of the best driving  vehicles  in its class  and that is \\na characteristic that the f -pace has been able to maintain over the last several years that being said  \\nthere are some changes to note particularly in terms of the engine lineup and i\\'ll get into those things in  \\nthis video and in fact we\\'ll start there with what you can get under the bonnet because in fact there\\'s  \\nonly one engine that truly carries over in its entirety from last year\\'s lineup whi ch had 18 different  \\nvariations that\\'s now been reduced to only six so while there\\'s less choice there was arguably a few too  \\nmany  variations  of jaguar  land rovers  products  before  the most  recent  rationalization  and given  that you \\ncan still customize the car to a significant extent i think six is probably about the right number but the  \\nrange starts with the carryover unit and that is the p250 four -cylinder petrol or turbocharged two -liter \\nunit from jaguar land rover\\'s ingenium modular combustion engine family and that produces 184  \\nkilowatts of power and 365 newton meters of torque and i spent all morning today driving a base p250  \\nrunning on 19 -inch wheels and it\\'s actually a really lovely unit uh you might think the base petrol isn\\'t  \\nenough to motivate the f -pace uh but actually it is it feels entirely content driving this car there\\'s heaps  \\nof torque available just off idle and actually the four -cylinder petrol has a really nice z -note uh when you  \\nrev it out so it even has a bit of kind of enjoyment in the oral sense to it i think it\\'s a really good spot for  \\nthe range to open and given that car is considerably more affordable than it used to be and it has more  \\nstandard equipment all in all it\\'s a pretty competitive offer particularly w hen you consider that the  \\nentry -level petrol engines you get in most of this car\\'s rivals are significantly weedier you definitely  \\nwouldn\\'t call the f -pace p250 wedi that being said the six -cylinder engines are undoubtedly the  \\ndesirable ones even if the p250 four -cylinder is more than enough i think a lot of people are going to be  \\nuh you know swooned by the diesel or the petrol six -cylinder option now the car i\\'m driving now is the  \\nd-300 inline six turbocharged diesel and for 2021 it also picks up a 48 volt mild hybrid system outputs  \\nhave been bumped slightly to 221 kilowatts of power and 650 newton meters of torque and this engine  \\nis just effortless i know that\\'s a cliche to describe large displacement diesels but it\\'s true there\\'s heaps  \\nof talk on offer here if you\\'re thinking of towing with this car the d300 is where you\\'d probably want to  \\n\\nput your money it doesn\\'t really sound like a diesel it just has that kind of low bassy note when you  \\naccelerate that i think is really quite appealing actually it has some intent to it it also delivers the best  \\nfuel economy of the lineup particularly because there\\'s no more four -cylinder based diesel um this is  \\nactually the only diesel you can get on the f -pace at this point when i say at this point i mean this is  \\nprobably the only diesel i ever offer again on the f -base particularly because of the news we \\'ve had in  \\nthe last month that jaguar will transition to an all -electric brand over the next five years and so if you\\'re  \\nthinking of buying a car like this with a combustion engine there\\'s not going to be that many more  \\nchances after this and i think it\\'s it\\'s an interesting moment to be driving or probably be the last  \\ndiesel -powered uh jaguar f -base and it\\'s a good one there\\'s also a six -cylinder petrol engine which is  \\nreally quite zesty that\\'s the p400 it produces 294 kilowatts of power and 550 newton meters of torque  \\nagain assisted by a 48 volt mile hybrid system like the diesel surprisingly efficient you\\'ll do kind of low  \\ndouble figures in combined driving despite the fact it\\'s really quite sprightly just as we found in the land  \\nrover defender where you can also get that engine it sounds good it\\'s got heats of go you\\' re probably  \\ndetecting a thread here that there\\'s no bad engine on the f -pace and that is precisely how it is but if you  \\nwant the biggest and the baddest the f -pace svr facelift will be arriving in about june july 2021 that\\'s a 5  \\nliter supercharged v8 putting out 405 kilowatts of power and 700 newton meters of torque with about a  \\n4 second  0 to 100 time uh and that thing  sounds  phenomenal  so if you\\'re  in the market  for uh you know  \\na glc63 or an x3m it\\'s probably worth waiting to test drive the facelifted svr as well now in terms of ride  \\nand handling that\\'s actually where the f -pace shines the brightest and a lot of that is kind of embedded  \\ninto the fundamentals of this car we\\'ve got jlr\\'s iq al2 aluminium chassis on this car and that keeps it  \\nnice and light the most fascinating thing is that the large ish f paste is actually considerably lighter than  \\nthe e -pace small suv the jaguar cell and that\\'s because it\\'s you know effectively al l aluminium and that  \\nimpacts everything about the way the f -pace gets down the road it means the ride is more subtle  \\nbecause there\\'s less weight to have to damp it means the turn -in is more immediate it means the limits  \\nof this car in corners  are higher  you know  it is still a relatively  tall suv but in so many  ways  it drives  like a \\nstation wagon the dynamics are really impressive in this car and particularly so in the lower end specs  \\nthat benefit from a smaller alloy wheel a 19 -inch wheel on the base vehicle and a chunky tyre which  \\nactually just gives the f -pace an impeccable ride quality this navy blue d300 that i\\'m driving now has  \\noptional 21 -inch wheels 20s are standard at this level and the ride is still impressive though you  \\ndefinitely get a bit more road feel it doesn\\'t diminish massively it\\'s still very bearable but this is one  of \\nthose cars where i think occasionally less is more and the package is now so well rounded at the entry  \\npoint i do question the need to even step up to the big wheels and uh more and more equipment i think  \\nyou can spend you know kind of less than 90 grand on road in this car and have a pretty nice luxurious  \\nsuv experience but still the six cylinder engines are super desirable as well there\\'s better road holding  \\nand more grip than in a glc or an x3 i reckon the steering\\'s lovely it\\'s not packed with feel but it\\'s super  \\nprecise and accurate and the ratio is perfect so you get as much steering as you expect you\\'re gonna  \\nget when you start to turn the wheel on this car you sit relatively high a feature probably inherited from  \\nthe land rover vehicles that uh are also produced by this company so the view outs good it\\'s not low  \\nand slinky and legs right out forward like a jaguar f -type but that\\'s okay so you know even though it\\'s  \\nnot traditionally jaguar -ish it still has lovely dynamics supple ride good handling a great set of engines  \\nand it\\'s pretty refined as well uh and you know the big the big elephant in the room has been the three  \\nyear warranty for the last few years not many people really want to take a punt on a jaguar with a  \\nthree -year warranty uh you know reliability has improved but it still hasn\\'t been quite up to the level of  \\nsome rivals but i think with a longer warranty and also five years of roadside assist i\\'d be a lot closer  \\npersonally to you know taking a punt on this car because it is just so much more desirable than  \\nsomething like a four -cylinder glc i reckon everything about it is significantly more luxurious yeah it\\'s an  \\ninteresting car definitely worth a test drive if you\\'re in the market so those are my impressi ons of the  \\nupdated 2021 jaguar f -pace there\\'s still a lot to like about this suv it\\'s super elegant to look at in my  \\nopinion  the interior  is a pleasant  place  to spend  time and it\\'s now even  more  tech centric  and the driving  \\ndynamics are just about as good as you\\'ll find in this segment and of course there\\'s the fire breathing  \\nsupercharged v8 svr still to arrive here in australia now given the longer warranty and all the other  \\nbenefits of the car are you considering a jaguar f -pace do you own one now what\\'s your experience  \\nbeen like let me know down below in the comments while you\\'re there

jaggi has just made an  \\nannouncement they\\'ve announced that by 2025 all of their new cars are going to be electric only that  \\nmeans that that f -base could be the last jaguar you own with an engine we better pick the right one  \\nthat\\'s what i hope to help you do now those are the time codes right there if you just want to jump  \\nahea d you can rifle through it pretend it\\'s a sock draw go for your life and down there the chapter  \\nmarkers same thing go for it if you want to read the full review go to carsguy.com.u give us a like and  \\nsubscribe everybody is it\\'s free design ah it\\'s beautiful and not that that the f -pace so the f -pace came  \\nout in 2016 and even after all these years i still think it\\'s the most beautiful suv in the world but there  \\nhave been some changes here\\'s what\\'s new there\\'s a new face the bonnet now goes all the way to  \\nmeet the grill the previous car had a nose cone this looks far better the grill is also larger and see those  \\nshapes in the mesh it\\'s modeled in the shape of the jaguar heritage logo that\\'ll impress your friends at  \\nthe bbq the new headlights  are slimmer  and the led running  lights  have  this new design  too the taillights  \\nare different too the previous ones had the dip molded into the tailgate now they\\'re a blade but the dips  \\nare still there in the led design and it\\'s still a very big hat tip to the f -type sports car and its rear bumper  \\nhas been redesigned too the f -pace\\'s insides have been updated as well just about everything you can  \\nsee here is new there\\'s the larger screen the climate control now has these chunky knobs and the  \\nsteering wheel is new too and it\\'s goodbye rotary shifter and g\\'day to this regular upright shifter with  \\ncricket ball stitching it\\'s a sporty luxurious cabin price and features june talk prices let\\'s talk prices okay  \\nthat\\'s  the entire  lineup  right there  as you can see it starts  at 76k for the entry  grade  car and heads  north  \\nall the way to the svr for about 142 000 it\\'s worth it though it\\'s it\\'s amazing now you\\'ll notice as well  \\nthey\\'ve all got our dynamic in front of their names and that\\'s because the aerodynamic pack\\'s been so  \\npopular that jagger\\'s just made it standard on all of them you want to talk standard features me too let\\'s  \\ngo all f -paces come with the new 11.4 inch touchscreen apple carplay and android auto there\\'s keyless  \\nentry push button start dual zone climate power adjustable front seats leather upholstery those  led \\nheadlights and tail lights and the auto tailgate the entry s and the sc above it come with a six speaker  \\nstereo while the hsc and the svr comes standard with a 13 speaker meridian sound system engine  \\nspecs there are four engines to choose from there\\'s the d300 which is the turbo diesel there\\'s the p250  \\nwhich is a petrol four cylinder there\\'s the p400 and that\\'s a six cylinder inline six turbo petrol and then  \\nthe top is the big daddy or the big mama it\\'s a five liter v8 to the p550 now all have eight -speed \\nautomatic transmissions and all are all -wheel drive practicality the f -pace is a five -seater mid -sized suv  \\nnow i\\'m i\\'m far from mid-sized  myself  i\\'m 191 centimeters  tall actually  but i can still sit behind  my driving  \\nposition look that sits in my driving position i\\'ve got that much room that much and headroom  \\nheadroom\\'s excellent back here too storage has been improved for this f -pace and in another win for  \\npracticality the location of the windows pictures has been changed that\\'s right they used to be up here  \\nand i complained incessantly to jaguar about it now look where they are down here you\\'re welcome do  \\nyou want to look at the boot it\\'s it\\'s around the back come on come on okay so yeah oh you\\'ve gone  \\naround that way  yeah so the f -pace has a 509 litre boot which is pretty good pretty good for the glass  \\nwhat okay let\\'s drive driving all right let\\'s go for a drive now i\\'m in the very entry car the p250 now it\\'s  \\nnot the d300 with the turbo diesel it\\'s it\\'s not the p400 the inline six and it\\'s not the big daddy svr sits at  \\nthe top of the range but you are still getting a brilliant suv in this p250 the four -cylinder if you\\'re worried  \\nabout it not producing enough grunt do not worry it makes 180 odd kilowatts and that\\'s plen ty of grunt  \\nthat\\'s v8 outputs from you know a few decades ago so don\\'t worry it\\'s still really grunty and it\\'s very  \\nresponsive as well eight -speed automatic transmission is good too okay so what\\'s new the  \\n\\nsuspension\\'s new when i say new it\\'s been it\\'s been tuned so what they\\'ve done is they\\'ve softened it a  \\nlittle bit made a little bit more composed especially at the back uh the rear suspension of the old car  \\nwas quite firm so you come around a corner like this and you hit a hit a mid corner bump like like that  \\none just there and it would feel a bit skittish quite quite brittle and firm this one is a lot more compliant  \\nand a lot more composed and oh god this is good this is the entry car and it\\'s really good  sorry i\\'m  \\ngetting distracted by how much fun this is the also fun is the p400 that inline six in that car is brilliant i  \\ndrove up here this morning in it it\\'s great if you don\\'t step up to the v8 and you\\'re hunting for torque and  \\nand power then that inline six is hard to go past the steering feels as sharp as it ever was it\\'s always  \\nbeen a really sharp steering car you only have to think a direction and you go it ah it doesn\\'t have  \\nluxurious steering which is like you know you get into some luxurious suvs and it\\'s this big long busboy  \\nor or this big slow bus wheel that takes ages to turn and it\\'s very light this is a little bit heavier and a lot  \\nmore direct so you only have to sort of like do that and you go that way like that it\\'s very good for sporty  \\ndriving now what\\'s visibility like because you\\'re going to be driving this daily um look i\\'ve lived with one  \\ndaily i\\'ve reviewed the previous one of you lots of incarnations of it and look the rear window is quite  \\nsmall but you\\'ve got a surround view camera um  this a -pillar does not get in the way at all it actually  \\ncurves around so you can see past pretty well and those rear windows are quite large too and there\\'s  \\nthat rear quarter  window  is quite  good  too for for visibility  and parking  oh this is good  seriously  how they \\ncan make an suv behave like a sports car i don\\'t know but this feels good yeah great handling good  \\ncomfort and what 76 thousand dollars for this particular car do like that inline six though all right should  \\nwe talk about safety safety the f -pace was given the maximum five -star end cap rating when it was  \\ntested in 2017 keep in mind that it is 2021 now but still it comes with aeb blind spot assistance lane  \\nkeeping assistance traffic sign recognition adaptive cruise control front and rear parking sensors and a \\nsurround view camera and there\\'s this jaguar badge and the reason why i really like it is because in the  \\nold model there was a big plastic plate around it that plate was the adaptive cruise control radar plate  \\nand they needed it now they don\\'t anymore do you know why because they made the jaguar badge  \\nbigger and it sits right there much neater looking fuel use jaguar says that after a combination of open  \\nand urban  roads  the fuel economies  range  from 7.0 liters  per hundred  7.8 for the four-cylinder  petrol  8.7 \\nfor the six -cylinder petrol and 11.7 for the svr 5 -liter v8 i didn\\'t think i\\'d remember all those did you well i  \\ndo i\\'m disappointed i\\'m disappointed that a plug -in hybrid is not in australia and it might not come either  \\nownership  didn\\'t  know  that oh oh sorry  as far as the warranty  goes  jaguar\\'s  got to some  pretty  big news  \\nas well there\\'s a five -year unlimited kilometer warranty now that\\'s much better than before and very  \\ngood for a prestige car as for servicing service intervals don\\'t really exist the car itself will tell you when  \\nit needs to be serviced and that\\'s for paying for them you can pay as you go or there are pre -paid plans  \\noh wow look how much room they give you to write notes look at all that note room plenty of notes love  \\na good note verdict okay it is score time so what i\\'m going to do here is i\\'m going to give  each section  \\nan individual  score  out of 10 and they\\'re  going  to give the entire  f-pace  range  an overall  score  out of 10. \\nnow let\\'s begin with design it\\'s even more beautiful than it\\'s ever been i\\'m giving a 9 out of 10. for  \\npracticality i\\'m giving it an 8 big boot plenty of rear legroom really good rear headroom and also the  \\nwindow switches they\\'ve moved them down thank you for safety i\\'m giving an eight out of ten it\\'s got all  \\nthe things you expect it to have it could do with more though for ownership i\\'m  giving an eight out of ten  \\nwell done jaguar for moving to a five -year unlimited kilometer warranty also if you\\'re getting one of  \\nthese  cars go for the pre-paid plans  too eight  out of ten okay  for price  i\\'m giving  it an eight  it\\'s pretty  well \\nequipped it\\'s leather from the base car up there could be more there i\\'m not gonna give it a nine i\\'m  \\ngiving it an eight for price for the engines and transmission i\\'m giving it a nine out of ten again that five  \\nliter v8 is brilliant but so are the four cylinder petrols nine out of ten and fuel economy i\\'m giving it a  \\nseven  i know  shock  horror  but i really  believe  that it\\'s 2021  and there  needs  to be a plug-in hybrid  in this \\nrange there is a plug -in hybrid f -pace it hasn\\'t come to australia yet i\\'d like to see it here now for driving  \\ni\\'m giving it 8 out of 10. i love the svr we haven\\'t driven that today but i have before in the past and it\\'s  \\nbrilliant but even the lower grade such as the p250 are brilliant to drive as well eight out of ten now the  \\noverall score for the entire f -pace range comes to 8.1 out of 10. now if you want to read the full review  \\ngo to carsguy.com.u  remember  give us a like and subscribe  oh and don\\'t  forget  2025  i\\'ve got four years  \\nleft of jaguars with combustion engines this could be your last one remember that [Music] you  \\n\\nCar Model: Jaguar 2021 F -Pace  \\nReview:  \\n[Music] this is the model year 2021 jaguar f -pace and today i\\'m going to take you around the key  \\ndifferences between this and the previous shape jaguar f -pace i\\'m matt smart and this is rybrook tv  \\nhang  on that sounds  loud this is gonna  be epic [Music]  so [Applause]  [Music]  [Applause]  how about  that \\nmontage looks pretty good this card doesn\\'t it well let\\'s start with the front end these lights here the  \\ndouble sort of led effect in these really cool it\\'s got this eyebrow thing going on here which kind of  \\nmake s the car look like it\\'s always aggressive and always ready to go we\\'ve got the new grille here  \\nwhich is the honeycomb effect it looks so cool doesn\\'t it and look at this camera this camera in here is  \\nfor the 360 parking which we\\'ll get onto a little bit later the front bumper has been slightly redesigned  \\njust to give it a more  angular  and more  aggressive  look i think  jaguar  has really  succeeded  in doing  that \\ncracking looking front end isn\\'t it look how aggressive it is always looks like it\\'s ready to go [Music]  \\nmoving along the side of the f -pace not a whole load has actually changed although on this car we\\'ve  \\ngot this really cool wheel design down here these are 20 inches and finished in black they look really  \\ncool against this eiger grey paint this little vent down here that\\'s new we\\'ve got the jaguar logo on there  \\none thing that hasn\\'t changed with the f -pace i s the practicality you\\'ve got two very big doors and the  \\nback one has plenty big enough to be able to get a child seat or the kids or the granny or the dog  \\nanything you want to get in there plenty of space but we\\'ll touch a little bit more on the interior shortly  \\naround the rear there are a few subtle little differences starting with the rear lights now if you use the  \\nlink in the top of the screen to go and watch our f -type walk around you\\'ll recognize these lights  \\nbecause they\\'re from the f -type down the b ack here the rear bumper has been redesigned and what  \\njaguar have done is get rid of the exhaust pipes so it makes for a much cleaner design around the rear  \\nlet\\'s check out boot space because it\\'s massive there\\'s loads of room in here and it\\'s electric always  \\nuseful now there\\'s plenty of space in here for a staycation and even more this car is available with a  \\nplethora of accessories so you can get a bike rack you can get a pet pack in here you can have a tow  \\nbar fitted so you can tow it is the perfect vehi cle for a uk staycation and if you\\'d like any more  \\ninformation or to find out anything about the accessories that are available on this car or any jaguar for  \\nthat matter use the link in the top of the screen or in the description below let\\'s go and have a look at  \\nwhat\\'s changed inside shall we electric lovely i think it\\'s in here where things are really different let\\'s  \\nstart directly in front of me with this steering wheel first seen on the eye pace and ever since then ever  \\nsince i drove an ipace i\\'ve wante d this steering wheel on the rest of the range and now it\\'s here it feels  \\ngreat  and these  shift paddles  behind  really  high quality  listen  to that proper  directly  in front of me as well \\nwe\\'ve got the digital display so you can set this to pretty much anything you want moving around to the  \\ncenter and a big difference is this the new pivi pro infotainment system it\\'s great it really is great this  \\nlittle screen here really crisp the definition on there is really great the new infotainment system proper  \\nproper good system this you can get android auto and apple carplay as well which is a big bonus  \\nmoving further down the air conditioning controls have been made really crisp really simple reall y \\nmodern they look great i love the gear selected down here it fits perfectly with your hand it\\'s really easy  \\nto use everything in general has just been made much simpler much crisper and much more modern  \\nand i think they\\'ve done a cracking job another thing that i love directly above me this panoramic  \\nsunroof is lovely and especially on a day like today letting in so much light spot on bravo jaguar earlier i  \\nmentioned the little camera on the front that\\'s to do with the 360 cameras now let me show you  \\nbeca use this is so cool so press the little button down here cameras how amazing does that look i  \\nmean it\\'s look at the definition of that we\\'ve got the grass we\\'ve even got i mean look at it it\\'s amazing  \\nthat\\'s so so impressive now i think we now need to go and have a look and see if the model year 2021  \\nf-pace drives any differently let\\'s go do that so then how does the model year 2021 f -pace drive well i  \\nhave to say it feels lovely plenty of feedback through the steering wheel on this new steering wheel is a  \\nmasterpiece in the shift paddles as i\\'ve already mentioned really lovely to use engine feels more than  \\npoke enough this is the two liter four -cylinder diesel engine plenty of poke in there and the ride feels  \\nreally pliant and good on these really bouncy british b -roads i would also say though that even though  \\n\\nthis feels very comfortable you can still feel that dna in it you can still feel that sporty dna because it still  \\nhas a little bit of a hard edge to it which is a very good thing because it still can attack corners with a  \\nreal vigor that i think is really integral to this car so i love all the little changes i think jaguar have has  \\nrefreshed this car in a way that still makes it feel like a brand new model and in a way it kind of is if  \\nyou\\'d like any more information on the jaguar f -pace or any jaguar for t hat matter please contact the  \\nguys at ryb jaguar using the links below please like this video subscribe to ridebooktv for plenty more  \\ncontent to come hopefully including more helicopters  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2022 F -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nthis is the new jaguar f -pace and by new i mean face lifted you see jaguar is going through its range at  \\nthe moment giving its cars new engines and revamped interiors that are made of nicer materials and  \\ncrammed full of new tech so what we\\'re gonna do today is go over all of the updates to this f -pace and  \\nsee whether  it can now hold its own against  the likes of the bmw  x3 and audi q5 but before  i get into the \\nreview why not hit the like button and subscribe because we\\'ve got plenty more awesome videos just  \\nlike this one now let\\'s start off with pricing the new and improved f -pace comes in at 41 000 pounds  \\nthat\\'s for the base car that you see here you can also get the r dynamic which makes it look a little bit  \\nsportier now that starts at 43 000 but if you want the full fat 5 liter supercharged v8 svr model then  \\nyou\\'re going to be paying 77 000 pounds but what i thought i\\'d do is i went on the yes auto app to see  \\nwhat prices are like and there are already plenty of deals on new and nearly new f -paces those are  \\n2021  cars so it\\'s not like you\\'re  gonna  have  to pay full price  if you don\\'t  want  to admittedly  it\\'s quite  hard \\nto tell the difference between a new f -pace and an old one because although this is a facelift it\\'s a very  \\nminor one indeed so the big changes are a new larger grille this is the biggest suv that you can  \\ncurrently buy in jaguar\\'s range so that larger grille just kind of sets it apart from its baby sib ling the  \\ne-pace you also have a new led head and tail light cluster the front bumper is now a little bit more  \\nangular and the same can be said for the rear bumper too we\\'ve got 19 -inch wheels here but you can  \\nspec them all the way up to 20 ones and that\\'s about it really but the f -pace was already a very  \\ngood -looking  car so jaguar  thought  why not spend  a little bit of money  on updating  the exterior  and then \\nthe rest of it on improving the interior the interior has been completely redesigned and it\\'s a huge  \\nimprovement over the old car in fact it now feels like a much more luxurious product and if anything it  \\nnow feels like it\\'s worthy of the jaguar name for instance the center console is all new and now features  \\na different  shifter  design  replacing  the dial in the old car the good  thing  is you can now rest your hand  in \\nit while driving along a bit like you can in an audi but the cup holders can get in the way a little bit the  \\nclimate settings are now activated through touch controls but changing the temperature crucially is  \\ndone through good old -fashioned dials that feeds out of a revised vent system that now merges  \\nseamlessly with the new dashboard layout and the overall build quality is a big step up from the old car  \\nwith lots of leather and this model comes with a very tasteful wood trim the big improvement though  \\ncomes  with the tech and it\\'s all highlighted  by this infotainment  system  it\\'s a kind of concave  screen  that \\nmakes it look as though it\\'s draped neatly over the dashboard the 11.4 inch panel runs the company\\'s  \\nnew infotainment software which not only looks stunning but is one of the most responsive panels  \\naround even apple carplay is really well optimized taking up most of the available screen space our  \\nf-pace s comes with a hybrid instrument panel with analog dials and a digital display in the middle a full  \\ndigital system is available and you can check that out in our xf review by clicking the link in the top right  \\nhand corner all cars though are really well equipped but there is the odd optional extra and some of  \\nthem are what i would consider core features particularly for a car costing 40 odd thousand pounds  \\nwireless  charging  for instance  which  we\\'ve  got in this car will set you back  300 quid still there\\'s plenty  of \\nlegroom in the back and the same can also be said for headroom as well and the boot measures in at  \\n650 liters  which  obliterates  the competition  in fact it\\'s so big you could  pretty  much  live in it what\\'s  really  \\nimpressive  though  is that this is one of the entry -level cars it\\'s the f-pace  s which  comes  in at around  42 \\n\\n000 pounds so if an entry -level car can feel like this then you\\'re not really going to feel too guilty  \\nspending  50 or even  60 000 pounds  further  up the line we\\'ve  got a new lineup  of engines  most  of which  \\ncome slightly electrified now the range kicks off with three diesels so two of them are based around a  \\ntwo liter motor available in either 161 or 202 brake horsepower form and you also get a three liter  \\nproducing 296 bhp now they all come with 48 volt mild hybrid systems which deep sound a little bit  \\nmore fuel and will give you a helpful boost when pulling away from a set of traffic lights there are also  \\ntwo normal petrol engines one of which is a two liter motor producing 247 bhp and there\\'s also a three  \\nliter straight six with 396 bhp and that also gets mild hybrid tech as well but the big addition under the  \\nbonnet though is the p400e plug -in hybrid now that\\'s based around a two liter engine and is connected  \\nup to an electric motor and combined they produce 400 brake horsepower but you also get a 17.1  \\nkilowatt -hour battery meaning you can drive the phev on electric power alone for up to 33 miles it\\'s  \\npretty quick too it\\'ll go from zero to 62 miles an hour in 5.1 seconds now performance is your thing then  \\nyou\\'ll want to go for the svr which comes with a 5 liter supercharged v8 engine producing 542 brake  \\nhorsepower now like the rest of the range it gets an eight -speed automatic gearbox and all -wheel drive  \\nmeaning  this thing  goes  from zero to 62 miles  per hour in four seconds  dead  well not this one this is the \\nbog standard one but you get the idea [Music] there may be lots of updates under the bonnet and on  \\nthe inside but thankfully jaguar hasn\\'t touched the way the f -pace drives because like many of its cars  \\nthe f-pace is fantastic behind the wheel and that\\'s for a multitude of reasons the things that really stand  \\nout is the way that it steers it\\'s got kind of a sporty feel to it which isn\\'t to everybody\\'s taste when it  \\ncomes  to an suv even  though  they\\'re  sports  utility  vehicles  but it just means  that you have  a really  good  \\nidea of the kind of vehicle that you\\'re driving because you\\'ve got a little bit of wei ght it kind of makes  \\nyou realize that you\\'re driving a bigger car but it also helps you place it on the road a little bit better i\\'m  \\nnot talking about getting the most out of a twisty b road i just mean being able to drive the car with a lot  \\nof confidence but that\\'s coupled up with a really lovely and plush suspension system that means that  \\nyes the steering feels not necessarily sporty but you can be assertive with it but the rest of the car is  \\nrelaxing this is designed to be a family car it\\'s designed to g o and do hundreds of miles in one sitting  \\nand you can do it in perfect comfort and it doesn\\'t compromise the ride but i think the thing that  \\nsurprised me the most so far about this f -pace is that we have the box standard diesel engine in this so  \\nyou\\'ve only got 161 brake horsepower but i don\\'t feel like i need anything faster really the only time  \\nwhere  i might  have  wanted  a bit more  of a shove  is pulling  onto a motorway  of where  there\\'s  a very very \\nshort slip road but it\\'s a really punchy engine and it\\'s nice and frugal as well it\\'s the sad side about the  \\ndemonization of diesels because you get great mpg and also in the case of this jaguar the engine is  \\nsuper smooth and it just kind of shows you where jaguar has spent its money jaguar big on diesel and  \\nthat\\'s why it\\'s found the downfall of diesels so hard you get in something like this and it\\'s a really  \\nmagnificent engine of course if you do want to future proof yourself there is now the plug -in hybri d i\\'ve  \\nnot driven it but 33 miles of range on electric power alone is pretty damn good you\\'re probably going to  \\nget closer  to 25-26 miles  in reality  but let\\'s say you\\'ve  got a 10 mile commute  to work  you could  go back  \\nand forth on electric power alone and only use the combustion engine for longer journeys now at the  \\nmoment the big differentiator between the different f -pace trim levels is the kind of semi -autonomous  \\ndriving modes so what we have kind of a standard even though this is the mid -spec s car is c ruise  \\ncontrol and you also have an adaptive speed limiter and traffic sign recognition so it knows if we\\'re  \\ngoing from a 40 into a 30 it\\'ll give me a little readout on the dashboard to tell me so there is a lane keep  \\nassistance as well but i find that it rarely cuts in when you need it to you can quite easily drift over the  \\nwhite lines and it won\\'t put you back in your lane and you also have a collision warning system too it\\'s  \\nreally hard to actually think of things i\\'m not a big fan of when it comes to the  way the f -pace drives i  \\nguess the gearbox can be a little bit confused at times i think also the build quality could be a little bit  \\nnicer the cabin now looks like it can rival german cars but the build quality just isn\\'t quite there yet  \\nneeds tightening up a little bit but other than that there\\'s a lot to love about the f -pace it looks great it\\'s  \\nquiet with this diesel on board you can get a hybrid if you want and best of all it\\'s actually really  \\nenjoyable to drive [Music] not only does this f -pace feel like a giant leap forward compared to the  \\npre-facelift car but it actually feels like a bit of a bargain because although its rivals feel like they\\'re put  \\ntogether a little bit better the f -pace feels more luxurious and it\\'s a lot of fun to drive so be sure to go  \\nhead over to yesauto.co.uk to see if you can pick yourself up a deal on a new or nearly new jaguar  \\n\\nf-pace [Music] you  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2022 F -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nwelcome to the 2022 jaguar f -pace p250 review meaning that this is the four -cylinder model and  \\nfour-cylinder  would  have  been  fine if this thing  didn\\'t  sticker  for 68 000  the way that you see it uh \\noptioned up here which is absolutely absurd we\\'ll talk more about that later let\\'s just first of all get this  \\nthing out on the road and see what it\\'s all about talk about what\\'s new talk about the exterior [Music] it\\'s  \\nnot a very quick machine at all that\\'s not why you buy this or at least this engine anyway so this is 2022  \\nnot a whole lot of changes for this model year it\\'s a carryover from 2021 that\\'s when this vehicle got all  \\nthe major updates and changes the visual changes up front the overall exterior got a little bit updated in  \\n2021 and of course the pivi pro 11.4 inch touchscreen that they have here in the interior these were  \\npretty much the major changes and of course the inline six which is turbocharged and supercharged  \\nwith a 48 volt mild hybrid system that is the exact same engine i tried in my land rover defender review  \\nso i\\'m going  to leave  a link to that in the description  box so you can check  it out for this vehicle  there  are \\ntwo inline six options basically you have a detuned version of the p400 which is what i tried in the  \\ndefender but i\\'ll talk about that during the drive right now let\\'s talk about the exterior because that is  \\nsomething i\\'ve really come to appreciate with this f -pace i saw them on the road before but it wasn\\'t  \\nuntil i got this as a test vehicle that i really start to appreciate it you know yeah this is absurdly  \\nexpensive mainly because this has crazy 22 -inch wheels which i definitely don\\'t recommend anybody  \\noptioning on this f -pace because it ruins the ride quality and it also costs between three or four  \\nthousand dollars something crazy like that so definitely skip that upgrade the engine for that price but  \\nit\\'s the wheels along with the with the black package on it that adds to the the look and the appeal of  \\nthis vehicle i won\\'t lie about that this almost has like a lamborghini urus that type of swagger to the  \\nexterior it\\'s really quite impressive and people do certainly notice it it\\'s a clean handsome design far \\nsuperior in my opinion in terms of looks compared to like the bmw x3s the audi q5s which is what this  \\ncompetes with i specced out a p250s and it came out to be around 60 grand i also specced out the 335  \\nhorsepower inline six model that came out to be around 66 000 both overpriced this is one of the more  \\npricey  options  in this category  so keep  that in mind  but let\\'s uh kind of come  to a stop and let\\'s transition  \\nover into this driving segment now that made pretty much no difference this vehicle with this engine is  \\nnot happy doing high speeds that\\'s not why you should be looking into this particular engine in fact the  \\nway i spec it out if you\\'re really serious about getting this vehicle the six cylinder was six grand more  \\nyou know if you\\'re buying this vehicle you might as well go with that i wouldn\\'t get the p 400 i don\\'t think  \\nthat\\'s necessary but even when i was driving this out on the highway i can tell this is one of those  \\nengines  where  it loses  steam  on the top end it\\'s not happy  doing  you know  close  to triple  digit speeds  in \\nfact you know this is not going to pull anything past 100 miles an hour you\\'re not going to get any real  \\nthrust or acceleration past that speed nor does that really matter in the united states but just so you  \\nknow  anything  over 80 miles  an hour i\\'ve noticed  that the stability  of this begins  to get a little bit nervous  \\nit\\'s not really too happy doing those speeds this particular vehicle the way you see it here it\\'s about 4  \\n000 pounds or so 4 100 pounds something like that the weight figure of this goes up significantly when  \\nyou option up the larger engines and of course there is the svr model as well which is a totally different  \\ntopic i spec that out and it was about 90 grand actually the jaguar fully loaded kind of performance  \\nmodels are actually  a good value  considering that  you get over  500 horsepower and  all but  aroun d \\ntown this engine is more than enough out in the highway just do under 80 miles an hour stick it in the in  \\nthe right lane and you\\'ll be happy with it you will be getting a little bit of that wind buffing effect at the 75  \\nmile per hour speeds this does not utilize double pane glass i wish it would for a vehicle of this price  \\ncategory  especially  because  this is the most  expensive  vehicle  in its class  or one of the most  expensive  \\nvehicles in the class along with the porsche macan i want to see double ping gla ss being used but  \\nenough of that the handling of this is also extremely impressive for what this is because this blends  \\n\\ntogether a good ride quality mixed with very decent handling characteristics and when i mention  \\nhandling many people think i\\'m comparing this to like a porsche gt3 or something people are very  \\nobtuse and they take things way out of context but when i mean handling i mean when you take your  \\ncasual left hand turns your right hand turns on everyday basis your occupants aren\\'t being thrown  \\naround in the cabin space okay everybody\\'s not being flopped around none of that is happening the  \\nvehicle remains neutral i t remains planted there\\'s enough confidence here there\\'s enough resistance in  \\nthe steering without it feeling overweighted  or overly synthetic which is great  which is that\\'s exactly  \\nwhat i want so around town this is a cool vehicle to mob around in okay now keep in mind this vehicle  \\nhas 22 inch wheels absolutely do not get these wheels not just because of the price but because it truly  \\ndoes  ruin the ride quality  because  i can tell this has a good  ride quality  it\\'s sprung  pretty  softly  or there\\'s  \\na good balance between sport and softness here so they\\'ve done a good job with the suspension but  \\nthese larger wheels when you go over the jittery bumps you really begin to feel it and that gets really  \\nannoying especially for a vehicle like this that\\'s a pretty unrefined undignified experience when you get  \\nit with these 22 inch wheels the base wheels are 19 inches that\\'s exactly what i would get you can pay  \\nlike 150 bucks get them painted black even the silver 19 inch wheels look good on this you also have  \\nan option of 20s and 21s again stick to the 19s this would be a fantastic daily with that tire and wheel  \\nsetup that being said the tire noise isn\\'t ridiculous it\\'s just the ride quality now there are some pretty big  \\ncons to this driving and that\\'s mainly with the transmission i do not like the way this 8 -speed  \\ntransmission shifts at all it\\'s very slow very sluggish nothing like the bmw zfs or the porsche pdks  \\nnothing along those lines this is the worst transmission performance amongst all the european vehic les \\neasily amongst the x3 q5 and even the mercedes glc when you\\'re at a stop when you\\'re kind of moving  \\nlike this and you step on it there\\'s turbo lag there is transmission lag that\\'s probably the most annoying  \\nthing about this vehicle now for most of the people buying this and the target demographic doing 15  \\nmiles an hour below the speed limit maybe it\\'s not a big deal to you maybe you\\'re just a jaguar freak  \\nand this is your dream  car this is what  you\\'ve  always  wanted  i i\\'m impressed  with this this has way more  \\ncharacter than the european i\\'m sorry than the german counterparts i will give it that so okay fine i can  \\nmaybe look over the transmission tuning and also the very stupid dynamic mode that this has which  \\nmakes pretty much no difference at all when i switch it over into that mode in fact sometimes it even  \\nreacts even slower than in the comfort mode it\\'s very strange very bizarre and also the animation for  \\nswitching over into the dynamic mode is also flawed as well very laggy so i just put it into th e comfort  \\nmode and just leave it alone because otherwise i really like the the drive mode selecting knob it\\'s a  \\nbutton that you had to push up and then you can twist the dial it\\'s very cool i like the way they do that  \\ntype of stuff but don\\'t waste your time with it reliability is one thing okay like people say a bmw isn\\'t  \\nreliable or an audi isn\\'t reliable well i don\\'t really necessarily think those cars are going to leave you  \\nstranded on the side of the road those are just expensive cars to keep up with in  the long term  \\notherwise they\\'re not bad cards they\\'re not really unreliable they\\'re just expensive to maintain but these  \\nthings  these  land rover  jaguar  products  the biggest  problem  with them  is they just have  random  glitches  \\nand mishaps i\\'ll give you an example i was backing this vehicle into my driveway and i put the vehicle  \\ninto reverse it wouldn\\'t go into reverse it just got stuck in in dry for a little bit very annoying i have no  \\nidea what happened there but it\\'s it\\'s these random glitches and the fact  that this particular vehicle it\\'s  \\nonly got 1500 miles on it and already it\\'s acting up like that the passenger seat it won\\'t go forward or  \\nbackwards  that electronic  mechanism  doesn\\'t  work  on this vehicle  it\\'ll go up and down  and you can play \\nwith the recline but you can\\'t push the seat forward or back very bizarre and that\\'s just what 1500 miles  \\nso yeah okay i\\'ve been preaching on this channel get a warranty with any car okay this is part of the  \\nreason why because of stupid little issues like this and my middle name is practically warranty at this  \\npoint because i preach it so many times and people think it\\'s like blasphemy that i even mention it okay  \\nyou can you can spend that warranty money on a crane and drop the engine and play with the car  \\nyourself if you want to waste your time i\\'d rather get the warranty get a get a cup of coffee at the  \\ndealership and a new loaner car that\\'s what i would rather do it with my spare time okay if my vehicle  \\ndoes have any mishaps but the problems that these jlr products have it\\'s a nuisance to everyday life it  \\nactually gets in your way in your everyday life and that\\'s not what a vehicle should do to you right like  \\nyou lease a bmw abandoned audi you know that\\'s it\\'s just gonna work for the first three years that  \\nyou\\'re leasing it that\\'s not a problem but you lease this sure you\\'re covered but you have to go through  \\n\\nall these little headaches and that\\'s what pisses me off about this brand otherwise i really like driving it i  \\ncan even get over the stupid 8 -speed transmission the ride was just fine especially if you got the  \\n19-inch wheels i think this is a 0 -60 in like 6.9 seconds and the 335 horsepower model does 0 -16 \\naround 5.8 seconds i think so it\\'s a second faster and maybe with the added weight the stability might  \\nbe a little bit better at the higher speeds with the six cylinder models so this actually had some  \\ncharacter with its driving feel which is fine the brakes are decent and i even like this interior space as  \\nwell in fact that\\'s  one of the biggest  highlights  with this vehicle  so let\\'s go ahead  and let\\'s transition  over \\ninto this interior  space  [Music]  okay  talking  about  the interior  now this has a gorgeous  interior  it\\'s got the \\noptional windsor windsor however you pronounce that uh optional quality leather here with the quilted  \\nstitching absolutely stunning definitely worth paying up for it that\\'s why the four cylinder model that i  \\nspecced out online came out to be around 60 grand because i had to get this leather definitely worth it  \\nand also this interior quality the way that it\\'s put together it\\'s actually solid it\\'s very reminiscent of the  \\nland rover range rover products in the past the jaguar interiors really sucked it was not hing like the the  \\nland rover vehicles but now we actually have a well -crafted interior space so i\\'m very impressed with  \\nthat i like this two -tone steering wheel it also feels great to grip onto we also have these meaty paddle  \\nshifters i i like how the vehicles that have the worst transmission performance gets the best paddle  \\nshifters and the vehicles actually have good transmissions they always get these stupid plastic paddle  \\nshifters very obnoxious but it is what it is these paddles are definitely somethin g to behold they\\'re fully  \\nmade out of metal they\\'re a good size they move with the steering wheel and the buttons the switch  \\ngear all that feels just fine one touch automatic windows for all four windows [Music] automatic  \\nheadlights all the little safety tech in here surprisingly works okay the 11.4 inch pivot pro touch screen  \\nnow that\\'s kind of the biggest talk because actually a lot of people have had some glitches and some  \\nissues with this um infotainment system i actually haven\\'t had any issues with it in fact i actually kind of  \\nlike it it just has a bit of a learning  curve  but otherwise  i genuinely  do like this this infotainment  you have  \\nthe wireless apple carplay and android auto and i\\'ve always enjoyed the way jlr does the the climbing  \\ncontrol i think it\\'s really sleek very clean and it genuinely uses physical buttons well not really physical  \\nbuttons in the center of it there\\'s actually have to touch buttons right there but it almost feels like you\\'re  \\ninteracting  with a physical  button  so i\\'m fine with that but i love the dials the way you pull them  and push  \\nthem to access the fan speeds the heated and cooled seats i will say the cooled s eats don\\'t really work  \\ntoo well but you do have them i would pay up the 900 to get the optional climate packages the hot and  \\nthe cold climate packages i think that\\'s definitely worth the money you have physical volume knob the  \\n8-speed shifter is easy of course to use that\\'s not a problem it just sometimes glitches up on me that\\'s  \\nmy only major  problem  with it and you have  a wireless  charging  pad which  doesn\\'t  seem  to work  maybe  \\nit\\'s because  of the chip shortage  not not really  sure you have  two cup holders  with this slot in the middle  \\nwhere you can actually have your phone standing up if that\\'s what you want and you have some other  \\nadditional space here as well in the center console but i will say the center armrest space is pathetic no  \\nreal space there but you do have a usbc connectivity there i guess i like how when you press park the  \\nelectronic parking brake automatically comes on that\\'s a great feature i enjoy the driving position of this  \\neverything  is easy  to see except  for the back  window  that kind of sucks  however  the the side mirrors  do \\na great  job so that\\'s  fine and it gives  you that higher  seating  position  that i think  most  people  will want  in \\nthe suv category  the bmw  x3 just feels  like you\\'re  driving  a sedan  it does  not feel raised  up at all this the \\naudi q5 the glc they do a good job of giving you that raised driving position uh makes you feel like you  \\ncan see over other people so i think a lot of people are going to enjoy that the comfort of these seats  \\nare excellent they don\\'t just look amazing but they are very comfortable to sit in obviously i\\'m having  \\nthat issue  with the passenger  seat where  it doesn\\'t  go forward  and back  you know  classic  jaguar  issues  \\nthe meridian surround sound system that you have to pay an extra 800 for definitely  worth doing  \\nbecause the base hits really nice and it doesn\\'t sacrifice the clarity either a great sound system this is a  \\nfar better interior space than the jaguar f -type the f -type interior was total trash this mimics the land  \\nrover interiors that level of quality i do have one rattle coming from up here which is very annoying but  \\nmaybe  a dealership  can fix that outside  of that little rattle  the interior  is put together  extremely  well i also \\nlike the matte textured wood glove box space is pretty minimal as is the door pocket space something  \\nto keep in mind but this audio system definitely worth optioning sounds like garbage in the f -type \\nsounds amazing in their suv products that\\'s the thing this is the top best -selling vehicle that jaguar  \\n\\nmakes without this they\\'ll probably go bankrupt so they don\\'t screw around with this car they do their  \\nbest job with it it gets the best updates the best interiors the best quality and the tech so that\\'s good  \\nrear seats though complete joke i mean it\\'s a joke in a lot of these european suvs i\\'ve noticed i think  \\nbecause there\\'s a lot of structural bracing and things to make these vehicles drive well i think that\\'s  \\nimpeding in the interior space a little bit in the front seats it\\'s okay and you also have this  panoramic  \\nsunroof but the rear seats you\\'re not really stretching out back there i\\'m five foot eleven getting in and  \\nout of this is pretty easy but you\\'re not really stretching out the trunk space is okay that\\'s not bad that  \\nshould be more than enough for most families it\\'s nothing crazy but it\\'s okay you can of course put  \\ndown the rear seats which certainly helps with the amount of space that you have to work with but  \\noverall this is a vehicle you should consider no i don\\'t know if you like jaguars go for  it i enjoy driving it  \\nit\\'s a cool car to mob around town in but it\\'s not perfect okay the transmission is a little annoying but  \\nmost importantly i don\\'t like the random glitches and issues that you have to deal with even if it is under  \\nwarranty even if you are leasing it brand new those types of issues really pissed me off because six or  \\neight years ago i\\'ve read that jaguar is trying to improve their reliability and they\\'ve totally not done that  \\nunder sixty thousand dollars japanese cars are really the su perior choice for around 60 you can get the  \\nnew mdx that\\'s kind of the way i would go you also have plug -in hybrid choices from lexus if you\\'re  \\nwilling  to wait you can get the nx plug-in for around  57 grand  and there\\'s  a 7 500 tax credit  involved  with \\nthat i just think the japanese vehicles give you the best bang for your buck very satisfactory driving  \\nexperience for that type of money with a lot less headaches as well past 75 grand this is where i\\'m  \\ngoing to be looking into the macon s and the gle 450 bend s these are kind of my top picks along with  \\nthe bmw x5 plug -in hybrid that\\'s something else to consider but again the good euro cars cost between  \\n75 to 100 grand that\\'s just the way it is so this is cool i guess get it if you love jaguars so i\\'m gonna  \\nleave it at that thanks again for watching take care and goodbye [Music] you  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2022 F -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nthe idea of jaguar  making  an suv was ridiculed  by the brand  itself a few decades  ago but fast forward  to \\ntoday and the f -pace has played a significant role in the british brand\\'s reinvention since its launch in  \\n2016 the f -pace has been a rival to cars like the audi q5 the bmw x3 and also the volvo xc60 but the  \\ntruth is that the f -pace has always been a bit off the pace with the best cars in its class that could be  \\nabout to change that\\'s because jaguar has given it a big refresh it gets a new interior different exterior  \\nstyling and a revised engine lineup including the addition of this new p lug-in hybrid model but are these  \\nchanges enough to keep up with its rivals before we tell you make sure you\\'re subscribed to our  \\nchannel so you can see all of our other new car reviews as soon as they go live and if you\\'ve already  \\ndecided that you want to buy a jaguar f -pace then you can save more than 1 600 pounds on one right  \\nnow on whatcar.com just click on the link to go straight to all of the deals on our website so what\\'s new  \\nwell the f -pace has had a makeover inside and outside but the exterior upgr ades like these slim led  \\nlights at the front and the rear the larger grille the slightly different bonnet are more subtle compared to  \\nthe changes inside it really is very different in here now and all for the better as well as a fresh look the  \\nf-pace now benefits from a refreshed engine lineup as well so now it\\'s got mild hybrid petrols and  \\ndiesels along with this full plug -in hybrid let\\'s take a closer look at this interior now and it really is so  \\nmuch better than it was before so now it\\'s got a genuinely upmarket look and feel with really nice  \\nmaterials everywhere so you\\'ve got a nice mix of plush softly finished surfaces and depending on the  \\ntrim level that you go for you can get really classy wood veneer finishes on this interior as well so this is  \\nnow really a worthy alternative to the really nice interiors you get in the audi q5 and the bmw x3 and  \\nbecause of these updates it means that the f -pace\\'s new interior is really at the sharp end of what this  \\nclass has to offer thanks to its solid build and high  quality feel and that definitely wasn\\'t the case before  \\nsomething else new in here is this touch screen infotainment system so now every f -pace gets jaguar\\'s  \\nlatest  pivot  pro infotainment  system  so that\\'s  in this 11.4 inch touchscreen  which  has got a really  simple  \\n\\nlayout it\\'s got a configurable home screen and it\\'s responsive it\\'s easy to get your head around so this  \\ndefinitely as is the theme of this interior is a big step forward from what we had before you also still  \\nhave  physical  dials to control  the fan speed  the temperature  and the seat heating  as well in terms  of the \\nother tech available in this interior you get analog dials as standard but you can upgrade to this fully  \\ndigital driver display and it\\'s really big clear easy to see and this generally is a comfor table place to sit  \\nas well it\\'s very very simple  getting  your perfect  driving  position  and there\\'s  loads  of storage  up front too \\nso under this center armrest you\\'ve got a big cubby hole there\\'s more storage on the center console  \\nyou\\'ve got some wireless phone charging at the top here and even underneath the center console  \\nyou\\'ve got some extra storage space too and the door bins are pretty big as well so all in all this new  \\nf-pace  interior  ticks quite  a lot of boxes  up front that it didn\\'t  take before  the f-pace  isn\\'t the biggest  large  \\nsuv that you can buy so if you compare it to big proper seven -seaters like the kia sorento the land rover  \\ndiscovery sport then sure they offer more space in the rear seats and also they can get seven seats  \\nwhereas the f -pace is a five -seater only but in the back this is still much more spacious than something  \\nlike a porsche macan and you can see i\\'m just under six foot the driver\\'s seat\\'s in my driving position  \\nand really  leg room  there\\'s  plenty  of it i can stretch  out and relax  it doesn\\'t  feel stingy  in that regard  at all \\nin terms of headroom with the panoramic summary fitted if i sit up straight my head is just about  \\nbrushing the roof lining here so it does feel a little bit cramped perhaps and if you\\'re regularly going to  \\nbe carrying adults in the back then you should be aware of the impact that adding a panoramic sunroof  \\nhas on headroom in the back but otherwise this does feel like a comfortable and spacious interior for a  \\nfamily of four no problems at all at 650 liters the f paces boot is comparable with the x3 and the  \\ndiscovery sport so in total you can fit eight carry -on size suitcases into the boot which is decent if not  \\nquite a match for the q5 which can fit nine and that is a really practical boot in this class and for even  \\nmore context compared to proper practicality first suvs like the kia sorento and the peugeot 5008 they  \\ncan fit 10 carry -on size suitcases  into the boot but those  figures  that we mentioned  for the f-pace  are for \\nthe regular petrol and diesel versions of this car this one here which is the plug -in hy brid isn\\'t quite as  \\npractical so you can see you\\'ve got this slope up and this bulge under the boot floor here and that is  \\nbecause a lot of the hybrid stuff that this car needs lives under the boot floor back here and what that  \\ndoes is rob you of quite a chunk of extra space so in total you\\'ll lose about two carry -on suitcases worth  \\nof space with the plug -in hybrid compared to the other regular versions of the f -pace and that is just  \\nsomething to bear in mind when it comes to deciding which version of the car you\\'d like [Music] every  \\nf-pace comes with all -wheel drive and an eight -speed automatic gearbox but there\\'s quite a broad  \\nchoice when it comes to the engines so there\\'s a p400 there\\'s a p250 but perhaps the most interesting  \\nchoice in the lineup is the car that we\\'re in now and it\\'s the p400e which is a plug -in hybrid so it gets a  \\ntwo-liter petrol engine and an electric motor now it\\'s quick but probably more important than that is the  \\nfact that this car can travel for up to 33 miles on pure electric power alone that\\'s okay but it\\'s not quite  \\nup there  with the best new plug-in rivals  that it\\'s up against  it\\'s further  than the 30 miles  you get from an \\nx3 but the lexus nx and volvo xc60 both offer more than 40 miles it\\'s worth pointing out though that you  \\nwon\\'t actually be able to achieve those ranges in real -world driving expect them to be around 10 to 20  \\npercent less than the quoted figure for any plug -in hybrid so overall while the p400e has an impressive  \\nhybrid setup it\\'s just a shame the range isn\\'t a bit more competitive with the b est rivals out there but our  \\nfavorite engine of the lot is actually the 201 brake horsepower 2 liter d200 it\\'s punchy from low revs it\\'s  \\nquick enough it\\'s pretty smooth as well and it\\'s more frugal than the regular petrols so it\\'s a diesel not  \\neveryone is going to want it but to us it makes the most sense now if you\\'re interested in the f -pace  \\nbecause of the kind of sporty characteristics that you think are on offer then it might not surprise you to  \\nfind out that the ride is certainly a bit on the firm side  so on the standard suspension setup around town  \\nparticularly just feels a bit rigid and there\\'s quite a lot of suspension noise as well so when you pass  \\nover lumps and bumps in the road there\\'s a lot of thumps and thwacks that you can hear and that does  \\nbecome  a bit annoying  on long journeys  but the ride does  improve  with speed  although  it is still true that \\nan xc60 a q5 they both offer a smoother ride now in the f -pace you can go for a slightly more  \\nsophisticated adaptive suspension setup called adaptive dynamics but depending on the trim level you  \\nmight have to pay extra for that and even with it fitted an xc60 a q5 quite a lot of other suvs still offer a  \\nsmoother ride than what you get the f -pace is more than capable of tackling tricky terrain as well and  \\nevery model comes with jaguar\\'s drive control system as standard and that lets you choos e between a  \\n\\nfew different  settings  like rain ice and snow  but if you want  your suv to power  through  bends  more  like a \\nhot hatch  on stilts rather  than a proper  old-school  4x4 then you\\'ll  love the f-pace  because  this is a really  \\ngood thing to drive the way it flows through bends is properly impressive for what is essentially a pretty  \\nbig suv and in fact there aren\\'t really many other suvs at all that are better to drive the f -pace is priced  \\nthere or thereabouts with most of its premium rivals but it does stand out because of its fantastic resale  \\nvalues which should mean good pcp finance deals every f -pace is well equipped too so should you buy  \\none well if you\\'re looking for a comfy and practical family car then it\\'s fair to say the re are other suvs  \\nthat are more spacious and offer a smoother ride but for pure driver satisfaction and for this smart  \\nhigh-grade interior the f -pace does stand out from its rivals if you\\'ve decided that the f -pace is the car  \\nfor you then you can get a 1600 pound saving on one right now on whatcar.com just click on the link at  \\nthe top of

compromise  of class  performance  and capability  to the \\nluxury mid -sized suv segment this much improved version further enhances its proposition with mild  \\nhybrid engine electrification plus a plug -in model along with more sophisticated media connectivity and  \\na far smarter  cabin  it\\'s now the car it always  should  have  been  and if you\\'re  shopping  in the segment  for

took jaguar so long to enter a segment that now  \\ndominates its sales is a difficult question to answer there was never the investment to create such a \\nthing until indian conglomerate tata took over control in 2008 and afterwards given jaguar\\'s close  \\npartnership with land rover there was a management disinclination for the two marks to cross into each  \\nother\\'s territory but it was thinking that had to change at the same time around the time of this model\\'s  \\noriginal launch jaguar\\'s engineers were grappling with the challenge of all electric engineering  \\neventually responded to with another similar sized suv the battery -powered i -pace launched in 2018  \\nwhich has since gone on to become one of the company\\'s best -selling models safe in the knowledge  \\nthat mixing the suv genre with electrification would hit the sales sweet spot jaguar then combined the  \\ntwo in late 2020 to create the hugely improved f -pace model we\\'re testing here obviously the existence  \\nof the i -pace means there\\'s no need for a full battery ev version of this car the f -pace\\'s sophisticated  \\naluminium  chassis  doesn\\'t  allow  for that anyway  but you can now have  a phev  plug-in hybrid  variant  the \\np400e derivative we have here with an ev range of 33 miles the more affordable diesel combustion  \\nvariants that most f -pace customers will continue to choose get a lesser sprinkling of electrification  \\ncourtesy of an mhev mild hybrid system and if you really don\\'t care about the polar ice cap and only  \\nprioritize performance in an suv of this type you\\'ll be pleased to hear that the wild v8 petrol powered svr  \\nmodel continues on at the top of the range away from engines the cabin\\'s been completely redesigned  \\naround a cutting -edge pivi pro infotainment system there\\'s also a smarter exterior look and  \\nsophisticated safety so has all of this revitalized the f -pace sales perspective proposition in the face of  \\ntough rivals also recently refreshed cars like the audi q5 the mercedes glc and the bmw x3 well you\\'ll  \\nneed the industry\\'s most comprehensive review the car and driving road test to find out [Music] virtually  \\nall suv makers will tell you that their cars are luxurious sporty and capable usually though the truth is  \\n\\nthat the model in question especially emphasizes one particular attribute often to the detriment of  \\nothers take the midsize luxury segment of this market a porsche macan is great to drive but pretty  \\nlimited off -road a mercedes glc feels luxurious but isn\\'t especially rewarding at the wheel and a land  \\nrover discovery sport will take on the wilderness but won\\'t make you feel special and costed when you  \\ntake a seat inside can a better compromise between all these virtues really be reached well this jaguar  \\nf-pace has always claimed to offer it when jaguar makes that claim you tend to sit up and take notice  \\nafter all the brand knows a thing or two about ride and handling and its land rover connections have  \\ngiven it plenty of understanding on the subject of four -wheel drive too plus of course the company has  \\nhad an awful long time to stand back and look at the market then come up with something better this  \\nf-pace  does  after all date back  only as far as 2017.  if you\\'ve  not tried one before  on paper  it looks  as if it \\nmight be rather good the low slung looks matched by equally sophisticated aluminium underpinnings  \\nunlike the smaller e -pace this isn\\'t a jaguar body slung on top of a land rover\\'s running gear instead the  \\nf-pace uses the iqal chassis from the company\\'s much -admired xc and xf saloons architecture lightly  \\nupdated here to accommodate this revised model\\'s more electrified engine range which as before  \\ndrives through a smooth shifting zf 8 -speed auto gearbox a few other little detail engineering ch anges  \\nfeature here segment first active road noise cancellation technology further improves the already  \\nimpressive refinement and there\\'s a new auto vehicle hold system to make pulling away from uphill  \\njunctions  a bit less of a faff but with this revised  f-pace  the big story  is what  now lies beneath  the bonnet  \\nmild hybrid tech to embellish all of the diesel engines and one of the petrol units too plus there\\'s also  \\nthe introduction of the plug -in hybrid p400e phev model we\\'re trying here we\\'ll start with the  mild hybrid  \\nmodel since those are going to be the most popular this mhev tech is applied to jaguar\\'s two liter  \\ningenium diesel engines offered in d165 and d200 forms the figures designating engine output and it  \\nalso features on the two six cylinder variants the d300 diesel and the p400 petrol in every case of  \\ncourse the concept is the same a belt integrated starter generator harvests energy usually lost when  \\nslowing or breaking that energy is then stored in a little 48 volt lithium ion battery secreted ben eath the  \\nrear seat before being intelligently redeployed to assist the powertrain when accelerating away and  \\ndelivering a more refined engine stop start system don\\'t get your hopes up too high when it comes to  \\nthe efficiency running cost difference the mhev system will make but you should notice a bit more zip  \\naway from rest courtesy of that extra harvested energy and sure enough you do you\\'d have to be on a  \\nbit of a budget to choose an f -pace with the base d -165 diesel 163 ps isn\\'t a huge amount to propel  \\nalong an suv weighing nearly two tons and in this form it certainly feels slower than the performance  \\nfigures rest to 60 in 9.2 seconds on route to 121 miles an hour would suggest courtesy of a torque  \\nboost from 380 to 430 newton meters the mid -range d200 diesel is far more satisfying the performance  \\nfigures improve to 7.6 seconds and 130 miles an hour if you use the transmissions quicker responding  \\ns setting or take control with the lovely zinc alloy shifter paddles and the d200 is of course far better  \\nsuited to the towing duties that some owners may have in mind unless you\\'ll be plugging your f -pace in  \\nit\\'ll come with a useful braked towing limit of two thousand four hundred kilos a six cylinder d300 diesel  \\nwould of course be even better here torque output skyrockets to 650 newton meters and the  \\nperformance stats jump to 6.1 seconds and 143 miles an hour but if performance is your priority in  \\nchoosing an f -pace you choose one of the petrol models probably not the base p250 the only  \\nmainstream variant that does without mild hybrid embellishment though in that form this suv is more  \\nthan acceptably rapid making 60 miles an hour in 6.9 seconds on the way to 135 miles an hour better if  \\nyou can afford it is the properly powerful p400 whose i6 6 -cylinder engine is an mhev which storms to  \\n60 miles an hour in 5.1 seconds to the accompaniment of a rather evocative growl on the way to 155  \\nmiles an hour potential porsche macan buyers will love it there\\'s no real need to go faster than that in a  \\ncar of this kind but if y ou want to anyway the wild p550 svr variant awaits at the top of the range with its  \\nfive-liter v8 supercharged engine that\\'ll howl its way to the 60 -mile benchmark in just 3.8 seconds and  \\non an autobahn or on the hanger straight at silverstone keep accelerating until you reach miles an hour  \\none for the very brave perhaps all of these engines are fundamentally familiar from before and there\\'s  \\neven plenty of carryover with this revised model lineups one completely fresh powertrain the plug -in \\nhybrid setup fea turing in the p400e variant that as mentioned earlier we\\'ve chosen to test today at the  \\nheart of this phev model\\'s engine bay you will after all find jaguar\\'s usual 2 -liter petrol ingenium turbo  \\nunit here though it\\'s been coupled with a 143 ps electric motor powered by a rear -mounted 17.1  \\n\\nkilowatt -hour battery that when fully charged can facilitate a 33 -mile all -electric driving range and if you  \\nwanted to take the car up to 87 miles an hour without burning fossil fuel for that you\\'d need to keep the  \\ndrivetrain in its ev setting one of three provided phev modes the other two are hybrid and save the total  \\npower output this combination generates 404 ps is a fair slug more than you\\'ll get from obvious bmw  \\nand audi rivals in this segment but unfortunately this p400e is portly await i think around  2.2 tonnes  \\ncancels  out any potential  performance  benefit  mind  you this four cylinder  plug-in f-pace  still manages  to \\ngo a little faster than its six -cylinder conventional p -400 counterpart making 60 miles an hour in five  \\nseconds dead though weighing half as much as an asian elephant fractionally restricts this phev  \\nvariance top speed to 149 miles an hour that weight is something you very definitely feel if you\\'re in a  \\np400e and throw it through a series of tight twisty corners in the way a likely owner rarely would which  \\nis a pity because it rather robs this car of the fluid rather agile and mildly engaging drive dynamics that  \\nalways marked it out from its german rivals fortunately that demeanor\\'s remained intact in the  \\ncommoner more affordable variants which can make better use of the suspension arrangement  \\nborrowed from those jaguar saloons we mentioned earlier with double wishbones at the front and a  \\nmulti -link rear a xle a setup you can optionally embellish with jaguar\\'s usual adaptive dynamics adaptive  \\ndamping system it\\'s standard on this phev yes through  the turns in a conventional diesel or petrol  \\nmodel there\\'s a touch more body roll than you\\'d get in an xe or an xf and yes the electric steering is a  \\nfraction less feelsome than an enthusiastic driver might ideally like but neither of these things  \\nsignificantly affect the way that you can hustle mainstream versions of this car through any given bend  \\nprogressing in a m anner that simply wouldn\\'t be possible in most other suvs of course there are  \\nreasons for this that go beyond springs and dampers there\\'s the kind of torque vectoring system you  \\nget on performance coupes that through tight turns transfers traction to the wheel that can make best  \\nuse of it plus when jaguar says this car\\'s now mandatory all -wheel drive system was originally  \\ndeveloped on the track it means silverstone not the serengeti it\\'s the defiantly rear biased system first  \\nseen on the company\\'s f -type sp orts car one that never diverts more than fifty percent of its power up  \\nfront a process that happens in milliseconds as soon as the first signs of wheel slip are detected  \\nanother key tool in the f -pace\\'s armory is jaguar drive control one of those setups that allows you to  \\nalter throttle response steering feel and auto gear shift change timings dependent on the way you want  \\nto drive simply make your choice between the various modes provided by this now restyled pop -up \\nmode controller next to the stitched ge ar selector comfort and eco are fairly self -explanatory while  \\ndynamic sharpens up the car nicely to the accompaniment of a red tinged instrument display there\\'s  \\nalso an extra rain ice and snow option that activates all surface progress control a speed cruise control  \\nthat helps maintain progress and avoid wheel spin on low traction surfaces you power away from using  \\na low traction launch system if your car has jaguar\\'s configurable dynamics package as it will have if  \\nadaptive damping has been fitted you\\'d al so get this dynamic eye screen that allows you to input your  \\nown specific dynamic or comfort settings for engine steering gear shift and suspension plus there\\'s a  \\nstopwatch  a lap timer  and a g meter  to underline  the brand\\'s  insistence  that this is indeed  the sports  car \\nof suvs having configurable dynamics also allows you to order jaguar\\'s terrain response technology its  \\nadsr or adaptive surface response setup which works alongside the all -wheel drive system in  \\nchallenging conditions adsr alters its response according to the surface to maximize grip for instance  \\nwhen moving from tarmac to wet grass friction levels are automatically sensed and the car\\'s throttle  \\nresponse adapted to stop the wheels from spinning it\\'s like having an expert sitting alongside you  \\nmaking  constant  changes  to suit the terrain  adsr was developed  at the challenging  land rover  east north  \\noff-road test track which we can tell you from personal experience includes rutted trails you simply  \\ncouldn\\'t even consider attempting in one of this car\\'s german rivals not if you wanted to avoid a trip to  \\nthe body shop anyway that an f -pace can cope here has a lot to do with its four -wheel drive systems  \\nintegrated idd or intelligent driveline dynamics control system which when you\\'re off -piste is  \\ncontinuously  estimating  not only the friction  between  the tyres  and the surface  but also how much  of the \\navailable grip is being exploited at each wheel hill launch assist further helps here as does the kind of  \\nproperly elevated ground clearance that\\'s so often lacking in more dynamically orientated luxury suvs  \\nthis jaguar sits a decent millimeters off the ground one reason why it can wade through water up to 525  \\nmillimeters deep and coat with maximum approach and departure angles of 25.5 and 26 degrees  \\nrespectively it\\'s yet another thing you simply wouldn\\'t expect this car to be able to do what you\\'ll need it  \\n\\nto be able to do of course  is cruise  with luxury  saloon  style refinements  as all variants  do and to be able \\nto smooth away the tarmac tears of the skull run again an f -pace speciality you\\'ll also want this car to  \\nrelax  you on highway  journeys  which  this jaguar  will do more  easily  when  fitted  with the brand\\'s  optional  \\nadaptive cruise control with steering assist system which takes care of most steering braking and  \\nthrottle duties for you providing your hands stay on the steering wheel it works in urban traffic too so an  \\nf-pace works just about everywhere from farm trails to the frantic morning commute it c ertainly isn\\'t  \\nperfect especially in this expensive plug -in form but you might well think it\\'s closer to being the perfect  \\ncompromise in this segment than any other rival [Music] it says much that jaguar likes to market this  \\nf-pace as the sports car of suvs the stylish shape remains pretty much exactly what we saw from the  \\ncoventry company cx -17 prototype a car unveiled back in 2013 at the frankfurt motor show in  \\nproduction form the lines turned out to be just as eye -catching chief stylist ian callum refusing to be  \\nconstrained by the suv sector\\'s usual aesthetic design cues instead delivering a much more dynamic  \\nsilhouette with a roofline lower and closer to the road than anything else in the segment and not much  \\nhas changed  with this package  of exterior  updates  or at least  you might  think  that until you take a closer  \\nlook so let\\'s do that and start up front now there\\'s a sculpted new bonnet with a wider power bulge that  \\nbonnet extending flush to the very top of the grille surround eliminating the rather ugly shot line that  \\npreviously ran across the nose it flows into a larger completely redesigned heritage inspired  \\nmonogrammed mesh grille with diamond detailing and a classic jaguar growler badge flanking this  \\nappendage are redes igned all led quad headlights that are 10 millimeters slimmer than before and  \\nthese further up the range featuring double j daytime running light graphics and animated directional  \\nindicators the upper and lower bumper sections have also been restyled as have these corner intakes  \\nnow as before most models will be sold in the r -dynamic form we have here distinguished from the  \\nstandard variants by a cleaner more open design for these huge corner intakes and a black finish for  \\nthe grille there are fewer changes  in profile though these side vents do now feature the iconic jaguar  \\nleaper  big wheels  are an intrinsic  part of this design  the smallest  rooms  you can now get across  most  of \\nthe range are 19 inches in size and you can go all the way up to the big 21 inch alloys we have here  \\notherwise the silhouettes familiar from before jaguar\\'s design team has done everything possible to  \\nbreak up and disguise the height of this suv hence this slash in the body work along the bottom of the  \\ndoors under which runs this slim angled silver strip there\\'s a powerfully strong shoulder line too while  \\nthis line that runs from the wing vent into the front door is another neat touch at the rear the tailli ghts \\noriginally inspired by the f -type sports car now have more in common with the i -pace ev featuring  \\njaguar\\'s chicane illuminating graphic you might not pick up on the fact that the tailgate is completely  \\nnew but an existing owner would be more likely to notice the redesigned lower bumper of course as  \\nusual what\\'s more important is the stuff you can\\'t see around 80 percent of the body is fashioned from  \\nlightweight aluminium  and some  of it the cross  chassis rail  for example  even  uses high -tech \\nmagnesium so  subtle evolution outside will the same be true of the cabin actually no unusually for a  \\nmid-term facelift almost everything here has been fundamentally redesigned and is all the better for it  \\nthe focal point is this new and much more sophisticated larger pve pro central touchscreen but there\\'s  \\nalso much else to catch the eye in an interior that feels very jaguar with an ambience completely  \\ndifferent to that you\\'ll find in german rivals there\\'s lots to take in if you happen to be used to the original  \\nmodel things like the sleeker vents the dished three spoke wheel and the more tactile gear lever  \\nreplacing the rising rotary dial used before surrounding it all authentic finishes feature in beautifully  \\nformed shapes reinvigorating jaguar\\'s rich lineage of luxury interiors this smarter center console has  \\nbeen redesigned too sweeping up to meet the center stack where a piano black panel houses classier  \\nclimate dials embellished with a jaguar coventry established in 1935 motif lovely the metal finishing you  \\nget her e around the gear stick on the steering wheel and along the door pulls really feels like metal  \\nwhich isn\\'t the case with rivals like the mercedes glc and twin lines of double stitching decorate the  \\ndash and the door cards before continuing down both sides of the restyled lower console jaguar wants  \\na lot of money for this car but you can see where it\\'s been spent the whole cabin ambience is designed  \\nto make anyone coming to this car fresh from one of the company\\'s saloons to feel instantly at home  \\nand as bef ore the so -called sports command driving position delivers the kind of high set authoritative  \\nseating placement that suv drivers like so much without perching you so far up that you lose the feel of  \\nbeing an integral part of the whole experience it\\'s a very well judged compromise positioning you  \\n\\nperfectly for the kind of involving drive promised by the sports car marketing rhetoric we remember that  \\nfrom the original version of this car but we also remember the rather clunky in control infotainment  \\nscreen setup which didn\\'t even have the apple carplay or android auto smartphone mirroring tech that\\'s  \\nlong been a norm in this segment but forget all of that now because this improved models replacement  \\npv pro system is one of the very best setups in its sector its touchscreen elegantly curved to match t he \\ninstrument panel\\'s profile 11.4 inches in size and encased in the black satin finished magnesium frame  \\nit\\'s so much  easier  to use than the previous  smaller  in control  setup  allowing  the driver  to carry  out 90 of \\ncommon tasks within two taps from the touchscreen thanks to the simplified menu structure basically  \\nwhat\\'s on offer here is a whole fresh generation of infotainment powered by dual sim technology with  \\ntwo lte modems enabling the software to carry out multiple functions at the same time such as  \\nstreaming  media  or downloading  software  over the air updates  that will enable  the system  to continually  \\nupdate  itself previous  owners  will immediately  notice  how much  quicker  everything  is thanks  to a built-in \\nbackup battery initialization for the 3d navigation system takes just seconds 4g wi -fi connectivity is  \\noptional  but if you have  it up to eight  devices  around  the car can be connected  so your rear passengers  \\nwill be grateful this right hand menu bar gives you quick access to this monitor\\'s major sections nav  \\nmedia audio and a final icons option that connects you to a display that collects together everything  \\nelse you might want to peruse as usual with these kinds of systems there\\'s a split main hom e screen  \\nthat prioritizes the things you\\'ll need most frequently probably nav phone and media as here and jaguar  \\nhas made up for its tardiness in offering apple carplay and android auto by making both elements  \\navailable with the option of more convenient wireless connectivity we are disappointed though to find  \\nthat the incorporated voice control functionality here is nothing like as intuitive as that you\\'ll find on  \\ngerman rivals still there\\'s a standard rear view camera and a lot of detail buried in the ico ns section a  \\ndynamic  eye drive  settings  screen  tractional  options  like all surface  information  and load traction  launch  \\nan eco data segment info on parking and a very informative weather menu that briefs you on climate  \\ninstantly hourly or five days ahead just about anything else you might need to know can be found in the  \\ninstrument binnacle and you\\'ll be particularly well served if you paid the extra for a plusher model with  \\nthis interactive  driver display  instrument binning  screen or stump  up more  to get  it fitted  in place  with \\nthe usual conventional analog dials this 12.3 inch tft monitor standard with this phev variant an d \\ncontrolled not particularly intuitively by this new steering wheels rather cheap feeling hidden until lit  \\nswitches is  pretty much  as customizable as  the best instrument  screens  you\\'ll find  with rivals if  you \\ndon\\'t want this conventional 2 dial layout you can prioritize a single dial or have the screen focus  \\nentirely on mapping media or driver assistance graphics info panels to the left and right of the display  \\ncan be configured with trip summary and media info or you can add a driver assistance graphic on  the \\nleft or mapping on to the right plus a press of the end of the left steering column stalk varies this small  \\nlower readout between trip average speed average or instant fuel consumption and driving range info  \\nenough on media what else might you need to know here oh we\\'ve talked about the greater feeling of  \\nluxury inherent in this dash design helped by the fact that it\\'s no longer simply lifted from the xe saloon  \\nlovely touches are plentiful the lovely cool zinc alloy gear shift paddles the cricket ball style stitching on  \\nthe gear lever the split rim steering wheel the knurled metallic rotary dials the touch sensitive overhead  \\nlights an ignition button that pulses red prior to startup and if you opt for the meridian audio system  \\nupgrade these brushed metal laser etched lacquered silver speaker frets little ergonomic touches have  \\nbeen addressed  too like  the way  that the  electric window  switches have  now been  repositioned from  \\nthe top of the door roll to the armrest putting them within easier reach we particularly like the seats  \\nwhich are the figure -hugging sports variety with the r dynamic trimmed models that most will want on  \\nalmost all variants they\\'re leather trimmed of course as standard and even entry level spec allows for  \\nlumbar support heating and eight -way part electric adjustment for this updated model these front chairs  \\nhave  been  revised  with wider  cushioning  optional  front massage  settings  and larger  heating  and \\ncooling areas for greater comfort a fresh interior lighting design also adds to the premium effect with 10  \\nselectable colors an upper strip of light encircling the front of the cabin and a lower lighting zone that  \\nuses a softer waterfall effect plus jaguar has introduced a sophisticated cabin air ionization system we  \\nhave  it here with a pm 2.5 filter which  features  a filtration  system  capable  of capturing  ultra fine particles  \\nyou activate it via a purify option on the climate screen overall then there\\'s much to like and little to  \\ncriticize though we still do have a few small issues the standard 125 watt sound system audio setup  \\n\\nisn\\'t particularly impressive presumably to encourage you towards the meridian upgrade the electric  \\nseat control still feel a little flimsy and as before rear visibility isn\\'t especially good mainly due to the  \\nraked back rear screen but also hampered by the rising door line and narrow rear quarter windows so  \\nit\\'s just as well that a rear view camera and all -round sensors are standard storage space provision has  \\nimproved though and this redesigned lower console now conceals away the cup holders with a slidin g \\nlid covering an area that also provides a small storage compartment along with a 12 volt socket though  \\nwhen was the last time you actually used a 12 volt socket jaguar seems to have a thing about them  \\nbecause another 12 volt socket features within this lidded box between the seats though fortunately  \\nhere you also get more useful usb ports gratifyingly of both the usb -a as well as the usb -c sort so you  \\ndon\\'t have to have the ugly converter leads necessary with german rivals this console around the gear  \\nlever  has been redesigned in its lower as well as its upper section there\\'s now a see -through open  \\naperture here at the bottom framed by metallic hoops that\\'s intended for small augment storage though  \\nit\\'s so shallow that items placed here might be in danger of spilling out into the foot wells during spirited  \\ncornering plus you also get a big glove box with a pen clip an elasticated strap decently sized door bins  \\nticket clips in the sun visors and the kind of overhead compartment for sunglasses that usually gets  \\nemitted  where  provisions  made  for the option  of a big panoramic  glass  roof as you can see here though  \\non an f -pace you can have both curiously jaguar forces f -pace customers of every trim grade to pay  \\nextra for the kind of wireless charging map that nearly every executive needs these days it sits in this  \\nopen compartment at the base of the center stack time to take a seat in the rear now as in the front the  \\ndoors open wide which means it\\'ll be easy to reach in and fit something like a child seat and as you  get \\nin also as in the front you slide onto the seat rather than clamber up into it as would be the case with  \\nsome other suvs once installed two tall adults get more headroom than you might expect the raked  \\nback roof line to be able to provide and there\\'s reasonable standards of knee room too certainly more  \\nthan you get with competitors like bmw\\'s x3 and porsche\\'s mccann as with those rivals the cabin will  \\nfeel pretty  cramped  if you have  to fit in a third occupant  thanks  primarily  to this high center  transmission  \\ntunnel there\\'s a central armrest with twin cup holders plus a center console with vents a cubby and yet  \\nanother 12 volt socket you\\'ll have to pay extra for the usb points you\\'ll need to keep the kids quiet with  \\ntheir games on longer journeys this  rear bench can\\'t slide as  it would on some rivals but  you can  \\nspecify an optional power reclining seat back there are netted seat back pockets overhead led reading  \\nlights coat hooks in the grab handles and reasonably sized door bins in the lovely doubl e stitched silver  \\ntrimmed door cards these little rear quarter windows let in much needed light and the cabin back here  \\nwill feel particularly airy if you\\'ve stretched to a model with this huge panoramic glass roof though it  \\ndoes slightly reduce headroom now let\\'s have a look at the boot accessed on almost all models via this  \\npowered tailgate that can feature gesture control useful if you happen to be approaching your f -pace  \\nladen down with bags and want to open the rear hatch with a swipe of your foot bene ath the bumper  \\nnow it rises  to reveal  one of  the larger  luggage compartments  in the  mid-sized suv  segment the  dry \\nload space  capacity  for mainstream  models  rated  at 601 liters  enough  for up to eight  carry -on suitcases  \\nas you might be able to tell from this curiously sloped entry section to the load bay floor of this plug -in \\nhybrid variant we haven\\'t got anything like that here thanks to the battery pack which must lie beneath  \\nthe base of the cargo area dry capacity in this case falls to 485 litres and as you can see you\\'re heavily  \\ncompromised in terms of under floor space too annoyingly the little compartment you do get under here  \\nisn\\'t big enough to stash the charging lead above deck though even with this p400e variant a set of golf  \\nclubs or a child buggy will easily fit across the range the cargo areas accessed across this rather  \\nimpractical metal covered loading lip which will quickly scratch and scuff but it\\'s usably shaped too and  \\nquite long measuring 1018 millimeters up to the rear seat backs as well as the usual tie downs and bag  \\nhooks jaguar also supplies four of these little metal catches to help secure items and of course you can  \\nspecify the usual optional nets and rails if you want to go further now it\\'s a pity this right hand side fuse  \\nbox lid isn\\'t better  secured  but there\\'s  a netted  area on the left and led lights  on either  side plus the rear \\nbench  is split in a flexible  40 20 40 formation  so you can slide longer  items like skis in between  a couple  \\nof rear seated passengers those needing more space will be irritated to find that jaguar still insists on  \\ncharging an insignificant amount extra for catches to push forward the rear bench we don\\'t have them  \\nhere without  them  you have  to go round  to the side doors  and use the catches  in the seats  with all three  \\nrear seat segment portions dropped down the floor isn\\'t quite flat but the 1428 liter dry cargo capacity  \\n\\nprovided is reasonably sized for this class of car that falls to 1299 litres for this plug -in variant [Music]  \\ngiven the rival models jaguar hopes to target in the mid -size premium suv market the f -pace\\'s pricing is  \\nrelatively predictable the mainstream range starting at around forty thousand pounds and extending up  \\ntowards the sixty thousand pound mark trim levels vary depending on the engine you choose but the  \\ncore ones you\\'ll mostly be offered are base spec then r dynamic s and an r dynamic se variant als o \\navailable in our dynamic black form our dynamic hse gets you all the bells and whistles whatever your  \\nchoice bear in mind that the all -wheel drive system and automatic gearbox that customers in this  \\nsegment now expect are included as standard even at the very bottom of the range take that into  \\naccount and if you were to look back to the prices being charged at this f -pace model\\'s original launch  \\nyou\\'d find that they haven\\'t actually risen all that much which is refreshing especially given the way that  \\nthe car itself is now so much better for a start all the mainstream diesel variants the models that most  \\ncustomers are likely to choose now feature the company\\'s latest mhev mild hybrid engine tech the  \\nmajority will be choosing between the two least powerful variants the d165 and the d200 there\\'s a  \\npremium of around two thousand pounds to go from one to the other now it\\'s hard to understand why  \\njaguar feels the need to charge so much more for its base petrol variant the four -cylinder p250 model  \\npriced  from launch  at around  48 000 pounds  particularly  as this derivatives  engine  is the only one in the \\nrange lacking the mhev technology from there around 55 000 pounds is the next pricing milestone the  \\nsum that allows you to choose either the six cylinder d300 mhev diesel or more likely the four -cylinder  \\np400e phev petrol plug -in hybrid we\\'re trying here for those prioritizing performance rather than  \\nefficiency there\\'s the choice of two top petrol variants the six cylinder p 400 and the wild v8 5 liter 550  \\nps svr a s we move on to the value proposition the f -pace pricing represents it\\'s worth pointing out that  \\nthere\\'s only one f -pace body style this model\\'s three german arch rivals bmw\\'s x3 audi\\'s q5 and the  \\nmercedes glc can also be ordered with sportier sweat back body shells respectively in x4 q5 sportback  \\nand glc coupe  forms  but let\\'s get on to this jaguar\\'s  value  proposition  which  will base  around  the volume  \\nd200  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2022 F -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nthe Jaguar f -pace has so much potential I mean in some ways it\\'s one of the very best mid -size SUVs  \\nthat you can buy but there was one thing holding it back something that we couldn\\'t ignore here at Auto  \\nExpress well guess what Jackie I\\'ve only gone and fixed it and the results are in and they\\'re blooming  \\ngood [Music] I\\'ll explain why in a minute but first let\\'s look at that handsome face the high shoulder line  \\nthe F -type esque rear lights it\\'s all very Suave and that\\'s because this f -pace is the face lifte d model  \\nthat arrived towards the end of 2020 which also brought new electrified powertrains right so what we\\'ve  \\ngot here is the p400e which is the plug -in hybrid so it\\'s got a two liter four -cylinder petrol engine that  \\ngives 296 brake horsepower which for a lot of people will be plenty but no on top of that you also have  \\nthe electric motor so that combined gives 398 brake horsepower so yes Punchy yes nippy yes it\\'s got  \\n620 newton meters of torque you really feel like you don\\'t have to work this engine hard to get it to go  \\nand it kind of suits the car\\'s personality I do want to point something out to you when you put it into  \\nDynamic mode there we go turns everything red stunning it plays like a fake V8 noise through the  \\nspeakers which I\\'m not too sure about unless let\\'s see oh yeah go on okay okay all right fine the fake  \\nV8 actually sounded quite cool when I put my foot down just then okay fine I will accept the fake V8 but  \\nwait being a plug -in hybrid what really matters is the electric element to the powertra in so what\\'s it like  \\nwhen  you switch  to EV mode  this is easily  the most  relaxing  f-pace  that you can buy when  it\\'s in electric  \\nmode  it can stay in electric  mode  for up to 87 miles  an hour and it can do that for 33 miles  and it\\'s super  \\nSerene and super quiet when it does it too oh and you can charge this at a rapid charger so you can  \\nget up to 80 in like half an hour it is worth pointing out though this car is easily over two tons so when it  \\nis in electric mode and you\\'re building up speed you can feel it struggle a little bit so then the  \\ncombustion engine kind of kicks in and helps it along the way oh and also you won\\'t be getting the 130  \\n\\nmiles per gallon that they\\'re claiming no that\\'s not going to happen maybe in the 50s 60s if you\\'re lucky  \\nnot 130. this  gearbox though  this automatic  gearbox is super  smooth super  smooth I  like that very  \\nmuch not too shabby then but one of the best bits about the f -pace is the way it drives it\\'s right up there  \\nwith the class leaders right let\\'s be honest no one\\'s going to be buying an f -pay so they can whiz it  \\naround on B roads but that doesn\\'t mean that you can\\'t enjoy how well sorted this chassis feels I mean  \\nthe grip on this thing  and the body  control  is really  really  impressive  the steering  has a nice bit of weight  \\nto it but it feels  quite  natural  at the same  time I mean  there\\'s  been  no sacrifice  when  it comes  to comfort  \\nor refinement you know when sometimes you\\'re driving a car and then you hit a bump in the road and it  \\ngoes there\\'s no gagong here it hits a bump and goes flim flum Flume that\\'s how it hits the Buns  \\nflumpflum flum however you want to spell it the f -pace really is one of the best handling SUVs of the lot  \\nbut to be honest it always has been where it has traditionally lagged behind its Rivals though is the  \\ninterior the f -pace launched where they clunky old infotainment and a cheap looking dashboard that  \\nreally  didn\\'t  do the rest of the card justice  but just look at what  they\\'ve  done  with the facelift  right interior  \\nthis is probably the biggest revamp that we have ever seen on a facelifted car it\\'s like we\\'re sat in a  \\ncompletely different car new steering wheel new Dash new center console I mean it\\'s stunning it\\'s quite  \\nstylish isn\\'t it I like the word plush for it\\'s very plush very plush I like the stitching on the gear lever  \\nbecause I think it looks a little bit like a cricket ball like if used to make this red it would be like a cricket  \\nball the screen 11.4 inches with I don\\'t I don\\'t know if you can see it but it\\'s  got a really subtle curve to it  \\nand it runs the same software as what\\'s in the new Range Rover so yes very very good the graphics  \\nare really stylish very classy I think and it\\'s super intuitive I mean look at this there\\'s no lag there  \\nwhatsoever Apple carplay Android auto so much better than the old system 12.3 inch digital instrument  \\ncluster that\\'s nice and easy to follow Meridian Hi -Fi which sounds gorgeous when everything\\'s all  \\nturned up really loud and you\\'re having a good Singh song in the car which f or me has likely been to  \\nAbba lovely uh even though it is packed full of tech they haven\\'t forgotten the important stuff like twisty  \\nclimate controls stunning oh beautiful okay so the interior has taken a giant leap forward and it\\'s just as  \\nspacious as before that means there is much more space in the back than you get in a Porsche Macan  \\nright while I\\'ve got your attention if you go for the regular f -pace then you get a whopping 650 liter boot  \\nbut if you go for the plug -in hybrid then you lose like a hundre d liters 552 liters well actually minus what  \\nthree liters because there\\'s nowhere else to put your charging cables and I really want to point out the  \\nweird shape of it because if you put awkward items in here I guarantee you by the end of your journey  \\nthey\\'re going to fall and end up down here and then you\\'re going to open the boot and however they\\'re  \\ngoing to fall out or you\\'re going to open the boot and then you\\'re going to have to kind of stop things it\\'s  \\njust a little irritant apart from that I love it  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2023 F -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nso welcome back to the channel guys today we\\'ve got Old Faithful RF pace and we\\'ve been lucky  \\nenough to have been loans the new shape f -pace by harwoods in Chichester So today we\\'re going to  \\ncompare the two and see how they stack up against each other I need to get down off of here without  \\nhurting myself and take this out for a test drive [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] thank you so what  \\nwe\\'ve got here today is the two liter diesel mild hybrid 2022 f -pace it\\'s the r sport variant the askbook  \\ndenotes th e trim level and being a mild hybrid this has a battery assist that does things such as healthy  \\nfuel economy and give you a little bit more performance this is probably a middle of the range in terms  \\nof spec and it\\'s wrapped in this gorgeous blue which I\\'m going to be honest I need to look up what blue  \\nthis is and I\\'ll pop it down the bottom of the screen there so first of all let\\'s talk about the exterior of the  \\ncar Jaguar have done a lot of subtle yet very very noticeable changes to the outside of this ca r that in  \\nmy opinion  just makes  it look so much  more  modern  than its predecessor  the front grille  and the Bonnet  \\nhas been totally redesigned this now comes further down whereas before it stopped up here and met  \\nwith the front bumper this gives you a much bigger Grille with a more modernistic or modernized  \\n\\nlooking effect to The Grille here and a bigger Jaguar badge in the center although less not spend too  \\nlong looking at that panel Gap there shall we the side vents have had a minor revamp bringing them in  \\nline with the same style that\\'s offered on the new F -TYPE and the keynote amongst you will notice  \\nthere\\'s no exhaust cutouts until you get to the three liter v6 or the svr variant and something that makes  \\na huge difference in my opinion is they now offer black badges with the black pack that comes on the  \\ncar so you get the the f-pace  the Jaguar  badges  in Black  as well as the black  window  surrounds  wheels  \\nand the tints to the windows on our car the pre -facelift version even though it had the black pack these  \\nwere still silver and in my opinion it just it\\'s just weird it doesn\\'t look right so well done Jaguar that looks  \\ngreat so as far as the exterior is concerned that\\'s about all that is different with this but when you get  \\ninside wow is it a different Beast altogether let\\'s jump in and have a look wow that th is is Worlds Apart  \\nI\\'m I\\'m actually thinking I\\'ve made a mistake in borrowing this I don\\'t know if I\\'m going to want to get  \\nback in my car this is an absolute step change from the pre -facelift I\\'m sitting in here trying to take it all  \\nin this is worlds apart from its predecessor if it didn\\'t have Jaguar written around the interior in some  \\nreally  quite  tasteful  places  I think  I\\'m inside  a Range  Rover  at this point  there\\'s  a lot to talk about  in here \\nso I\\'m going to do a little bit of a video montage now showing you how different this interior really is and  \\nthen we\\'ll dive into what that actually means foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] all in all I think the  \\nnew interior is such a revolutionary change for the f -pace it really has modernized it beautifully it\\'s got  \\nrid of some of that aged infotainment system in favor of some more modern tech and as I said if it  \\nwasn\\'t for those Jaguar bits and pieces around the cabin I would genuinely think I\\'m in side a Range  \\nRover and that\\'s really apparent in what Jaguar are trying to do they\\'re not borrowing Parts out of the jlr  \\nfamily from Land Rover and putting them in their f -pace which is their Flagship 4x4 they\\'re borrowing  \\nParts out of the Range Rover and that really shines through in the quality of the interior and the overall  \\nexperience this is a very nice place to be I think I\\'ve shot myself in the fur in having to go back to my  \\npre-facelift I think this video might have cost me an awful lot of money but  it\\'s not all sunshine and  \\nrainbows there are a few bits in here where I think they\\'ve probably just let themselves down ever so  \\nslightly take a look at this I\\'m hoping the microphone will pick up on this doesn\\'t sound great does it  \\nsame goes for down here it is padded plastic it\\'s not just hard plastic but it\\'s not great this is just a  \\npersonal preference thing but there\\'s no sunglasses holder I don\\'t really know what that is but there\\'s  \\nnowhere to put your sunglasses anymore and again those who watch the channel regularly will know I  \\ndo like a pair of sunglasses and they\\'ve done away with the suede cloth headlining in favor of just a  \\nblack  fabric  which  whilst  yes it\\'s soft and it\\'s it\\'s quite  nice it\\'s nowhere  near as good  as that suede  cloth  \\nin the in the previous the pre -facelift we still have this gorgeous panoramic roof letting in a lot of light  \\nwith an electronic sun shade that you can pull over so in terms of spec in this car we\\'ve got the heated  \\nsteering wheel very important at this time of year as you saw earlier on in the video we\\'ve also got  \\nadaptive cruise which sits behind that emblem we were looking at earlier hence the sort of domed  \\nplastic effect to it Lane keep assist speed limiter and I think perhaps my favorite bit is the wirel ess \\ncharger that they finally put down here any of you who watch my channel regularly will know I\\'ve  \\nrecently just fitted a wireless charger to RF Pace the pre -face lift which as far as I know wasn\\'t an  \\noption but that comes down there now in the new shape and the carplay is Wireless itself and this  \\nscreen has got such a good resolution on it let me pop it in reverse it\\'s like reversing in 4k it\\'s nuts The  \\nClarity on that is Bonkers it really puts the pre -face to shame and the parking sensors are a lot more  \\nresponsive a lot more fit for purpose we\\'ve also got heated windscreen and heated seats there is an  \\noption you can put cooled seats in you\\'d see that filling up blue the same as this one fills up red but this  \\nthis car doesn\\'t have that this is just an Arsenal four quart filler and if Wireless carplay isn\\'t your thing  \\nyou can still go old school so with all that said and done let\\'s take this out for a drive and see what it\\'s  \\nlike on the road [Music] [Music] [Music] so let\\'s talk about the drive the first th ing you\\'re struck by when  \\nyou get into this car and you start doing any sort of speed it\\'s just how quiet it is it it\\'s phenomenal it\\'s  \\nnight and day compared to the the preface I don\\'t know if it\\'s the tires the suspension the way they\\'ve  \\ninsulated the body I don\\'t know but this is quiet the second thing you\\'re struck by is just how responsive  \\nthe gearbox is and also how quick the start stop technology is in this because of that mild hybrid action  \\nit\\'s one thing that really bugs me in the pre -face that we own is the start stop you always have to turn it  \\noff when you get into the car if you don\\'t want it on it doesn\\'t stay off and it can be quite slow when you  \\npull up to a junction if the start stop kicks in the engine turns off you\\'re there you want to pull out and  \\n\\nthere\\'s a lag of about a second maybe a second and a half before anything actually happens in this it\\'s  \\ninstantaneous you don\\'t have a conventional starter motor per se but you have a high voltage motor  \\nthat goes straight onto the crankshaft and this thing\\'s just instantaneous the steering in this is perfectly  \\nbalanced when you\\'re moving at speed it\\'s got a nice heavy feel to it that adds to the stability of the car  \\nbut the minute you drop that speed back and you start maneuvering it becomes a lot lighter w hich \\nmakes it a lot easier to to move into parking spaces or moving around town it\\'s just perfectly balanced  \\nin both of those environments something they\\'ve done a fantastic job there one thing that does strike  \\nme as quite odd is the noise the brake pedal makes now this will be a Servo boosted assist I would  \\nguess unless there\\'s some funky hybrid stuff going on under there which as far as I\\'m concerned is  \\nsome sort of dark magic Wizardry but when you push the brake pedal every time you get a weird  \\nsquelch n ow it\\'s not a huge problem but if you\\'re sat in the car and you haven\\'t got your music up loud  \\nevery time you go to break squelch it\\'s weird as far as visibility goes is really actually quite good in here  \\nis worlds apart from the F -type but then a very different application of vehicle and you don\\'t really need  \\na huge amount of driving AIDS things like blind spot this car doesn\\'t have it but don\\'t really think you  \\nneed it you\\'ve got an auto dimming rear view mirror to help with the Dazzle and that\\'s about it these  \\npillars are really Slim doesn\\'t obstruct a lot of your view and there\\'s not a massive blind spot you can  \\nreally see around using those nice big mirrors without too much worry the two liter diesel mild hybrid is  \\na four -cylinder turbocharged engine with electronic assist churning out 163 brake horsepower now  \\nthose 163 horses will catapult you to at the top speed of 135 miles an hour and it will get you from 0  to \\n60. in 6.9 seconds now we\\'re not going to break any land speed records with that but for a big heavy  \\n4x4 Chelsea  tractor  that\\'s  quite  good  I think  now with that 163 brake  horsepower  isn\\'t going  to lose your \\ndriving license just quite as quick as you\\'d like rest assured there are different models you can get in  \\nthe engine Department you can get a 300 horsepower V6 petrol very similar to the engine or almost  \\nidentical to the  one that they  put in the  F-type and you  can get 575  brake Horsepower  Supercharged  \\nV8 lump in the svr which is identical to the engine that they put in the F -type svr and if either of those  \\ntwo don\\'t do it for you you\\'re probably in the wrong business now a small change but one that makes a  \\nhuge difference to the Driving Experience is the redesign of these paddles that sit behind the steering  \\nwheel yes this car is not a track Queen you\\'re not going to be slapping up and down the gearbox  \\nhammering it through the Apex of your favorite corner on your favorite race track maybe if that\\'s what  \\nyou bought this car for but this is more suited to the Chelsea tractor lifestyle but what it does mean is  \\nthat if you want  to grab a handful  of the gearbox  you can really  find that paddle  a lot easier  and it makes  \\npulling out of Junctions or overtaking on Dual carriageways a lot easier now that two liter diesel  \\nfour-banger churning out 163 brake horsepower will get you anywhere between 35.2 to 46.8 miles to  \\nthe gallon on the book real world has anyone\\'s guess until we actually get one and start doing some  \\ndriving  in it but on paper  that\\'s  the figures  that are claimed  by Jaguar  now this thing\\'s  not going  to break  \\nany land speed records anytime soon but if you kick it over into Dynamic mode knock it down Beyond  \\ndrive into sport mode it does have quite a bit of poke and I think that\\'s where you get the assistance  \\nfrom the the electric part of that mild hybrid it does pick up really quickly in mine the pre -face lift that\\'s  \\njust a two liter diesel there\\'s no hybrid aspect to it and when you grab a foot full of the carpet through  \\nthe pedal it kicks down the gears it\\'s like stirring a bowl of soup with the gearbox whereas in this when  \\nyou put your foot down it\\'s instantaneous and there\\'s no there\\'s no scrambling for Gears the car just  \\ngets on with it and no he\\'s not going  to break  the sound  barrier  but it just picks  up the speed  and makes  \\novertaking so much easier and safer really well designed now let\\'s talk about the big ticket item the  \\nprice and this this one\\'s been a really hard one for me to wrap my head around because the used car  \\nand the new car market is drastically different to what it was a year ago two years ago we can thank  \\nbrexit we can thank covid we can thank the sewers Canal we can thank Russia the list goes on as to  \\nwhy there are economical crisis is in place that are impacting the global economy and it\\'s no secret that  \\nthe car market has suffered probably a lot more than quite a few other sectors in that but that said the  \\nbook price of one of these on the road albeit base level entry level they start a Chester shade over 45  \\n000 pounds I think 45 098 pounds which is a heck of a lot of car for the money especially when you  \\nlook at the refinements  that have  been  made  to this and it really  firmly  plants  it in the same  league  as in \\nmy opinion  a Range  Rover  Sport  or Velar  going  back  to scratching  that itch if you want  that svr because  \\nthe 163 brake horsepower in this isn\\'t going to cut it for you I think they retail they start from about 78  \\n\\n575 I\\'ll bang it down there hopefully my memory is right which again is a lot of car for the money when  \\nyou think you\\'re getting a 575 brake horsepower car that\\'s that\\'s a lot lower car for for the money if you  \\nwere to look for the equivalent in a Range Rover I should imagine you\\'d be comfortably looking around  \\n120 000 pound mark so this is really Bittersweet this is a lovely car it\\'s got that mild hybrid technology  \\nthat I keep talking about but Jaguar a stopping production of all internal combustion engine s by 2025.  \\nso it\\'s yet to be seen what their plan is with cars like this are they going to completely discontinue the  \\nf-pace in favor of things like the eyepiece or are they going to put an electronic engine is it an engine I  \\ndon\\'t  know  an electronic  motor  and power  plant  and transmission  into this chassis  and I genuinely  hope  \\nhere\\'s the latter because this is such a lovely place to be it\\'s light years ahead of the i -pace I\\'ve really  \\nnot done  myself  any favors  in testing  this car because  I I want  one Powers  distributed  between  the front \\nrear axles in this because remember it\\'s an all -wheel drive audix to be specific the way the power was  \\ndistributed between the two axles is is brilliant the F -type if you come out of a corner too quickly that  \\nback  end is getting  really  tail happy  now I know  there\\'s  there\\'s  about  400 more  brake  horsepower  in the \\nF-type which is contributing factor absolutely but when you come out of a corner in this or you put your  \\nfoot down on  a you  know anything  other than  a straight trajectory  it just  grips the  road phenomenally  \\num you can really feel the computers doing their bit between the two axles and that\\'s that famous  \\nJaguar uh  distribution of  power between  the axles  it will  always have  the rear  wheel drive  \\npredominantly in use and the minute it senses that loss of traction it will kick over into all -wheel drive  \\nand that\\'s really noticeable and it really gives a great Driving Experience what Jaguar have managed to  \\nachieve  with this is creating  two cars the original  F pace  and the facelift  f-pace  that are so dissimilar  but \\nso alike in so many  ways  and I think  they\\'ve  been  very sympathetic  in in the way they\\'ve  designed  them  \\nand the way they\\'ve approached face lifting this model which is really nice to see from the outside it\\'s  \\ndifferent enough to look modern yet still easily identifiable as an f -pace and what really sort of took me  \\naback was as you get into the car you\\'d be forgiven for thinking you\\'re not even in an f -pace anymore it  \\ndoesn\\'t look anything like its predecessor and it\\'s just a fantastic place to be even the entry level two  \\nliter diesels got enough power when you combine it with the mild hybrid technology you\\'re  not really left  \\nwanting for anything as I said earlier you\\'re not going to break any land speed records in this but that\\'s  \\nnot what this car is designed for this is your grocery go -getter this is for running the kids down to  \\nfootball practice or for going out mountain biking for the day with your bikes on the bike rack on your  \\nDeployable tow bar that\\'s a fantastic option in these cars I dare say if you had the svr variant it would  \\nhold up very well around  track  probably  going  to spark  a bit of controversy  with this statement  but I think  \\nthe car is let down by the Pirelli P Zeros that come as standard on this I\\'ve just upgraded both of our  \\ncars to Continental and to Michelin and it\\'s night and day in the grip you have on the road Chapo  \\nJaguar I think you\\'ve done an incredibly good job in reimaging the f -pace there\\'s no secret that Jaguar  \\nhave had their financial troubles recently they\\'ve been all over the financial times and the News various  \\nissues with with stock and ownership and sales projections all that type of thing but this car I can see  \\nvery easily catapulting Jaguar back up right next to Range Rover in exactly where they should be in the  \\nluxury 4x4 Market [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] of the new face lifted Jaguar f -pace I\\'ve  \\nreally enjoyed my time in this car a big thank you to Harvard\\'s Chichester for giving me this give me the  \\ntime to enjoy it and also the time to fall in love of it to the point where I think they\\'re probably going to  \\nend up costing  me quite  a bit of money  in the near future  so top marks  for your sales  taxis guys  but also \\ntop marks  for the the accommodating  and Incredibly  friendly  people  at Harvard  Chichester  thank  you as \\nalways if you\\'re not already subscribed to the Channel please think about smashing that button down  \\nthe bottom and I\\'ll see you in the next video peace [Music] thank you oh does it oh no let\\'s try again  \\n[Music] [Music]  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2023 F -Pace  \\nReview:  \\n\\nbuyers of mid -sized premium SUVs are truly spoiled for Choice those looking for luxury can go for  \\nsomething such as an Audi Q5 BMW X3 or Volvo XC60 and if you\\'re looking for something a little more  \\nsporty than perhaps a Porsche Macan or an Alfa Romeo stelvio what if you\\'re looking for something in  \\nthe middle well a Jaguar f -pace could definitely fit that bill it\\'s been with us since 2016 which is a long  \\nold wild but various facelifts and improvements along the way means it\\'s now a more compelling  \\npropositio n than ever it\\'s available with a range of petrol and diesel engines most of which have mild  \\nhybrid technology however the one we\\'re playing with today is the p400e plug -in hybrid which will be  \\nthe one to go for if you\\'re a company car driver because it\\'s low CO2 emissions will save you a packet  \\nin monthly benefiting kind company car tax bills however you come by your car you\\'re going to need it  \\nto be a practical family carry -all kind of car so how does it score on that front well first of all you get a  \\npowered tailgate as standard which is very useful and a decent Square opening and most versions get  \\nupwards of 600 liters the downside of the 400e is that the battery packs sit underneath the boot floor so  \\nthey do eat into that space a little bit that leaves the figure you\\'re left with down at 485 liters to be fair  \\nthat\\'s still more than the 450 liters you get in the plug -in version of the BMW X3 but the space available  \\nis heated  into further  by the  fact there\\'s  no underfloor storage  for stashing  your charging  cables  so \\nyou\\'ll have them rattling around in the main load area the elevated boot floor also leaves you with this  \\nodd slope  up to the level part and when  you fold the 40 20 40 split folding  rear seats  down  it also leaves  \\nyou with this awkward step down to the backs of the rear seats talking of the rear seats they have lots  \\nof leg room  when  you need  to put people  in them  and there\\'s  plenty  of Headroom  even  with the optional  \\npanoramic sunroof in fact you\\'d have to be well over six foot tall before you find yourself rubbing your  \\nhead  on the ceiling  and the middle  seat is plenty  wide enough  so you can definitely  fit three  people  side \\nby side although shoulder room is a little bit of a squeeze we mentioned earlier that the f -pace has  \\nundergone various improvements and nowhere is it more evident than in here when it first came out it  \\ntrailed its German competition both in terms of quality and ergonomics now however it\\'s up there with  \\nthe best of them on the quality front the materials are now plusher and the various switches work in a  \\nfaultlessly slick way so it all feels very classy indeed those clever switches also help improve  \\nergonomics as does the latest pivypro touchscreen infotainment system the graphics are sharp the  \\nscreen transitions are slick and the operating system is well laid out and intuitive we still prefer systems  \\nwith a rotary dial controller but as touch screens go this is about as good as it gets the one remaining  \\nergonomic annoyance is the gear selector because it\\'s got this kind of trigger thing at the back of it  \\nwhich you must press every time you want to go either from drive to reverse or reverse to drive an d if \\nyou forget which can often happen the desired gear change doesn\\'t engage and so we\\'re driving  \\nforwards and then we park so we\\'re reversing and then we want to drive forwards again and it will still  \\nmove but we\\'re going backwards and I want to go forwards there we go [Applause] since we\\'ve  \\nestablished we\\'re driving the plug -in hybrid version of the Jaguar f -pace let\\'s start with the Driving  \\nExperience aspect of it there\\'s an electric motor and a two liter four -cylinder turbocharged petrol engine  \\nproduci ng just shy  of 400  brake horsepower  and that power  goes to  all four  wheels as you  would  \\nexpect  with that sort of power  output  this is not a slow car when  you floor the throttle  naught  to 60 takes  \\njust five seconds and so the surge of acceleration you feel is very strong indeed the power delivery isn\\'t  \\nalways as responsive as it might be though especially when you\\'re driving along a more gentle speed  \\nand when you\\'re doing this the chances are you\\'re powering it by Electric only and so it\\'s very peaceful  \\nand gentle and quiet and you can do that for up to 40 miles on full battery charge however when you  \\nput your foot down for a burst of additional acceleration the drivetrain often thinks that the motor can  \\ngive you the desired level acceleration on its own but then it often changes its mind after a couple of  \\nseconds where upon the petrol engine fires up and gives you an extra surge of acceleration that pause  \\nsometimes gives you the impression that although the performance is undeniably strong it\\'s sometimes  \\na little bit harder  to get at like many  plug-in hybrids  do it does  feel a bit heavy  on the brakes  when  you\\'re  \\npulling up and stopping it\\'s no surprise really that the plug -in hybrid version of the f -pace is a good few  \\nhundred kilos heavier than other f -paces one concern about all that extra weight is that it might ruin the  \\nf-pace\\'s Stellar handling but we\\'re happy to report that it doesn\\'t Okay so it may be a fraction less agile  \\nand alert than other f -paces but it\\'s still a really enjoyable car to hustle alon g with a level of poise and  \\nprecision that belies its size the steering is a particular highlight because it is well weighted accurate  \\nand Deft this combined with the Jaguars other handling attributes means it flows from corner to corner  \\n\\nboth effortlessly and gracefully there is a payoff for that nimbleness though all f -paces have a firm ride  \\nwhich means that although they stop short of being uncomfortable they are still less comfortable than  \\nmany key rivals more powerful derivatives of the car the p400e included have adaptive suspension  \\nfitted as standard which is optional on more humble models and it definitely makes the car more  \\ncompliant although it never loses that firm Edge you can switch between Dynamic comfort and  \\neco-driving

has stood the test of time going way back to the mid -1930s  \\nthey\\'re also a brand that has a proud and long lineage in the automotive World whether it\\'s racing or  \\nproducing great sports cars and grand Tours late last decade Jaguar decided to go in the crossover  \\nDirection with the E and F pace and people are wondering did Jaguar make the right choice but we  \\nhave  seen  some  other  Rivals  do the exact  same  such  as Porsche  with the Macan  and the cayenne  and \\nalso recently th e maserag or kale and Levante but I want to take a deep dive into the f -pace see what  \\nthis vehicle is all about is it Dynamic and sporty is it a crossover that\\'s upscale and very premium  \\nquality to match its price point but also is it a vehicle at around 60 to 70 thousand dollars that\\'s giving  \\nyou everything you could possibly want in a luxury crossover now before we get in this video I want to  \\ngive a huge shout and thank you to Jaguar Land Rover of Peabody and Peabody Massachusetts for  \\nallow me to this rev iew the link will be in the description below so you can check out their extensive  \\njaguar and Land Rover inventory also before we get started make sure to hit the Subscribe button and  \\nclick the notification Bell so you\\'re notified every time a new video goes live on the channel and so  \\nwithout wasting any further time let\\'s get right in this review deciding to join the crossover Market has  \\nbeen lucrative for many non -mainstream manufacturers who for the longest time didn\\'t want to tarnish  \\ntheir Legacies some  Brands made a switch but at the expense of selling their souls to produce  \\nmundane crossovers that lacked inspiration and driving characteristics that enthusiasts could enjoy the  \\nJaguar f -pace quickly Incorporated attributes from the luxury sedans in the lineup while also appealing  \\nto power hungry drivers giving them a wide range of powertrains including a V8 with the svr on the  \\ncomplete opposite side of the spectrum you\\'re the P250 a mall that looks fun and engaging but for  \\nthose not looking to spend close  to 100 Grand is it the perfect fit for those looking for a well -balanced  \\ndaily driver  starting  off with pricing  the Jaguar  f-pace  p250s  comes  in at a base  cost of fifty six thousand  \\ndollars placed just below the P400 within the lineup unlike larger competitors the f -pace is the flagship  \\n\\ncrossover for the brand as there is no 30 alternative planned for the foreseeable future and as a result  \\nit\\'s likely  going  to be the vehicle  of choice  compared  to the smaller  e-pace  despite  being  mostly  credited  \\nfor its performance -oriented reputation the f -pace is surprisingly practical and spacious and in fact is  \\nslightly longer and wider compared to German competitors offsetting the lower roof line and F -Type  \\ninspired rear fascia to retain an adequate amount of cargo capacity and interior space for secon d row  \\npassengers the full paint finish around the wheel arches is enough to conclude that this crossover is  \\nspecifically designed for  on-road driving  but with the  ground clearance  of 8.4 inches  you should  have  \\nno problem taking on unplowed streets during the winter in many regards the f -pace often gets  \\noverlooked as Jaguar is a niche brand specialized for a very specific type of buyer but also this  \\ncrossover hasn\\'t seen a major overhaul since its arrival to showrooms late last decade yet there has  \\nbeen a minor cosmetic facelift in recent years adding very subtle changes to the row presence the  \\nbeauty of the f -pace\\'s design is that incorporates the front fascia from the XF appearing more like a  \\nlifted car rather than a rugged SUV as a striking Body Lines Marines a dynamic yet sophisticated style  \\nto this vehicle while may be controversial we prefer the breast of aluminum accents for the grill on this  \\nmodel rather than opting for the gloss black exterior pack as gloss black trim is still present along t he \\nside profile and around the fog lights completing a classy look for the f -pace standard LED headlights  \\nwill provide more than enough lighting when traveling at night but also the L -shaped date time rain  \\nlights does draw your attention when taking a first glance at this crossover moving over to the side  \\nprofile our model is sitting on 21 inch 5 split spoke satin dark gray wheels which fits the design of the  \\nf-pace more so than the 19s however if ride quality and having a softer suspension is a top priority go  \\nwith the smaller  tires yet we found  the 21s to be perfectly  fine as road noise  was kept to a minimum  and \\nhow this crossover manage the imperfections in the road was similar to what we\\'ve experienced from  \\nrivals you\\'ll have body color folding side mirrors with turn signal indicators to go along with blind spot  \\ndetection for added safety then coming around the back taking inspiration from the F -type and XF the \\nthin LED tail lights they wrap around the final third of this crossover is likely one of the first things you\\'ll  \\nnotice for the f -pace along with a sportier and coupe -like roofline tuck beneath the bumper will be the  \\ndual exhaust  Outlets  keeping  the rear fascia  looking  clean  but also as previously  mentioned  gloss  black  \\naccents tie the appearance of the f -pace together as the color contrast complements the gray exterior  \\nvery well under the hood the P250 is powered by a 2 -liter turbocharged four -cylinder engine producing  \\n246 horsepower and 269 pound -feet of torque and is paired with an 8 -speed automatic transmission  \\nwhile Jaguar is mostly associated with being a performance focused brand with this powertrain the  \\nf-paces on -road composure is similar to many rivals in this market where the driving Dynamics are  \\ntuned for a quieter and more relaxed experience rather than putting you on the edge of your seat  \\nhowever when accelerating and entering highways the f -pace has no problem putting the power down  \\nespecially in the range between 20 and 60 miles per hour also the a -speed automatic transitions  \\nthrough the gear smoothly complementing this model\\'s luxury first approach for the drivetrain all -wheel  \\ndrive does come stan dard for all  trims whether it\\'s the P250 P400  or svr to provide year -round  \\nversatility and for fuel economy you\\'re looking at right around 22 miles per gallon in the city and 27  \\nmiles per gallon on the highway stepping inside you could buy a classy and certainly British designed  \\ninterior as a light oyster perforated leather seats contrast nicely with the ebony dashboard and subtle  \\nwood grain trim for both the driver and passenger on this model they\\'ll have 16 way power adjustable  \\nheated ventilated and memor y seats that offer plenty of support and cushioning and you\\'ll have the  \\nability to upgrade the Windsor leather for a more opulent experience in front of you between the analog  \\ngauges there will be a digital display that showcases basic information and while not equipped on this  \\nP250 opting for the head up display might be worth the additional one thousand dollars if you prefer  \\nkeeping your eyes on the road rather than looking down at the gauge cluster or at the infotainment  \\nsystem and speaking of the head u nit you\\'ll have an 11 inch touchscreen with Apple carplay and  \\nAndroid auto compatibility to go along with onboard navigation and the Meridian sound system  \\nfunctioning  much  like a tablet  there  isn\\'t much  of a learning  curve  when  navigating  your way through  the \\ndifferent menus as it\\'s clean laid out and quick to respond better yet and still great to see in 2023 is the  \\nphysical dials for the Dual Zone clock Patrol rather than having to waste time and taking your eyes off  \\nthe road to adjust the temperature from the touchscreen the infotainment system will also be home to  \\nthe settings that customize your drive modes if configurable and active Dynamics have been equipped  \\n\\non your P250 and for those who anticipate many thrilling road trips there is a stopwatch to measure lap  \\ntimes and also a g meter ambient lighting is also optional helping to set the mood and bring a solid  \\nsense of luxury to the cabin finally you will have a rear backup camera with trajectory to go along with  \\nfront and rear parking sensors the rest of the Interior is minimalistic in design with a wireless phone  \\ncharging  pad conveniently  placed  beneath  the touchscreen  and for the center  console  to the right of the \\ngear shifter will be the drive mode selector where you can quickly change between Eco Comfort  \\nDynamic and adaptive surface response which helps deliver the right amount of torque for a new  \\nencounter  different  types  of Road  surfaces  the center  storage  compartment  you have  plenty  of room  for \\nsmaller items like a wallet and smartphone and rounding out the front seating area above will be a  \\npanoramic moonroof which will let in a lot of natural light to the interior now moving on to the second  \\nrow we\\'re going to start off on the passenger side and this heat has been adjusted a bit further back it\\'s  \\nnot on a recline but I have plenty of legroom here and when you take a look at what the Jaguar fbase is  \\nproviding  on paper  when  it comes  to Interior  spacing  it is on par with a lot of its Rivals  which  is a bit of a \\nsurprise because with the f -pace you have a lower roof line or it has that sportier roof line with the  \\nsporty  rear fascia  but also you would  think  that the interior  wouldn\\'t  be that spacious  from the outside  as \\nthe fbase does have more of an athletic design to it and yet here I am at around five five so not the  \\ntallest person out there but I\\'m pretty comfortable back here there\\'s a lot of legroom a lot of Headroom I  \\ndo think that for taller passengers they should be able to sit back here pretty comfortably and not need  \\nto worry about hitting their head on the headliner even with the massive panoramic moon roof also  \\nwhen it comes to shoulder room plenty of it the f -pace is rather wide a bit wider than some compact  \\ncrossovers in this price range and market so you don\\'t even really need to worry about this vehicle not  \\nbeing family friendly or conducive for you and your family now moving on to the center seat there are  \\nsome good  placements  for your feet there  is a very aggressive  Center  hump  which  is similar  to what  we \\nsee for grand Tours and when I look at the F Pace from the outside but also when you\\'re on the road  \\ndriving it around it does have a grand tour like feel when it comes to handling when it comes to the  \\nsuspension and just the ride quality overall and the fact that we do have this aggressive Center hump  \\nthough  is very similar  in a characteristic  that we see from the sports  cars in the lineup  now because  this \\nvehicle  is somewhat  wide I think  you can fit a third person  back  here I think  you can you can have  three  \\naverage  size adults  sit back  here pretty  comfortably  and they won\\'t  feel claustrophobic  at all then on the \\ndriver\\'s side the seat is adjusted to someone of my height around five five and I have a lot of legroom  \\nhere where I can just sit back relax and enjoy the Driving Experience now since this is a two -row \\ncrossover these seats don\\'t recline which isn\\'t too much of a surprise but still these seats do pr ovide a  \\nlot of support and cushioning where I think on a longer drive you won\\'t be tired after that long two to  \\nthree hour road trip with the family also backing you do have two rare air vents that our model does not  \\nhave  heated  outboard  seats  you do have  a 12 volt Outlet  and rounding  out the second  row seating  area \\nyou do get a center armrest with two cup holders now coming around to the back you\\'re going to  \\nreceive a power liftgate and inside behind the second row seats you\\'re looking at right around 31 and a  \\nhalf cubic feet of room making the f -pace one of the more practical crossovers in this market and price  \\nrange this is far better than the Alfa Romeo stelvio Mercedes -Benz GLC Porsche Macan and also the  \\nnew Maserati gracale you can have plenty of room to fit all your luggage if you are going on a road trip  \\nwith the family also out there to fit all my camera today so it\\'s two bags of camera gear a gimbal box  \\nand a tripod no problem at all and probably could have gone grocery shopping after this review as well  \\ndue to the size of this cargo area it\\'s nice and wide also of course even though this is a crossover it\\'s  \\nvery easy to load your gear back here as well then with the second row seats folded you\\'re looking at  \\nclose to 70 cubic feet of room once a gain putting the f -pace as being one of the more practical options  \\nin this market so if you are moving stuff around maybe you\\'re going skiing and snowboarding you\\'ll be  \\nable to fit all your equipment when you are going on that road trip or Journey then on the left side of the  \\nrear cargo area you will some netting force of smaller items such as water bottles car detail equipment  \\nor a first aid kit but more importantly beneath the floor mat you will find a spare tire which is really great  \\nto see in 2023 as a lot of brands have removed this feature entirely for most Vehicles so if you  \\nencounter a flat on your road trips or travels you can fix that and be back on the road also minor  \\nfeatures that I really like is the rear cargo cover which will keep all your valuable items out of sight so if  \\nyou are like me and you have  camera  gear or anything  else of value  you can leave  them  back  here and \\n\\nhave that peace of mind knowing that no will be able to peek in and steal what you have and then once  \\nyou\\'re done just press the button and the lift gate will close automatically so we\\'re now behind the  \\nwheel of the 2023 Jaguar f -pace 250. let\\'s see how this vehicle performs how it handles how it drives  \\nhow it compares to other premium luxury crossovers in this market and also see if the four cylinder is  \\nproviding more than enough at this price point for Jaguar it\\'s all about the experience and the complete  \\npackage if  you\\'re  somebody  specifically  looking  at the Jaguar  f-pace  you want  premium  luxury  you \\nwant refinement you want quality and that\\'s exactly what you\\'re going to experience with this crossover  \\nnow you can upgrade to Windsor leather which I would highly recommend and there\\'s actually a few  \\npackages that I would go with for this particular trim and with this powertrain because with the P250  \\nobviously you\\'re not prioritizing performance you don\\'t need the V6 and obviously you\\'re not looking at  \\nthe V8 with the svr so quality and comfort is certainly something that you\\'re going to be drawn into and  \\nthe Windsor leather is certainly going to heighten that experience now the leather we have today is  \\nmore than adequate in fact these seats are very aggressively bolstered for a vehicle that\\'s not  \\nperformance oriented very supportive what I also like too is a seating position as well you sit pretty high  \\nup in this vehicle but when it really stands out to me and this is one reasons why I think the f -pace is  \\nkind of like the Alfa Romeo  stelvio  and Porsche  Macan  in a certain  way is that you feel as though  you\\'re  \\none with the chassis of this crossover rather than sitting on top of it and you can definitely tell that the  \\nf-pace is inspired by the F -type in some way shape or form when it comes to visibility when you are  \\nbehind the wheel you have a nice panoramic view a -pillars are actually very thin for a vehicle in this  \\nmarket so you won\\'t have any blind spots when you are approaching an intersection then taking a look  \\nat your side mirrors they are decently sized and they\\'re placed in the right spot so I can see what\\'s  \\nbehind me and then looking out back you are going to have that sportier rear facial so you can have a  \\nthinner rear window now I can see what\\'s directly behind me but the headrests might get in the way in  \\ncertain  situations  the ride quality  is certainly  a standout  to me I have  been  driving  this vehicle  around  for \\nabout 10 minutes and even with the larger tire size you barely feel any imperfections on the roadways  \\nbut also compared to other crossovers in this market that I\\'ve driven whether it\\'s BMW Audi  \\nMercedes -Benz I think the ride quality is certainly higher and more conducive for somebody who is  \\ngoing  on longer  road trips than what  we\\'ve  seen  from competitors  the suspension  is very soft but I have  \\nseen mixed reviews on that where some people say the suspension is a bit rigid and stiff now I think  \\nthat\\'s probably Jaguar f -paces with the dynamic handling package which I would recommend if you are  \\nlooking for an engaging Driving Experience behind the wheel although I would still go with a package  \\nthat really prioritizes that interior comfort that just my take for a vehicle at this price point also  \\ninstallation is Top Notch you don\\'t really hear any of the outside world at all in fact all I\\'m hearing is that \\nfour-cylinder engine no road noise no wind noise this is a very well insulated crossover it isolates you  \\nfrom the outside world which I think is what really adds to the appeal for Jaguar in general Jaguar is  \\ngiving you an experience of sixty five thousand dollars much like Porsche is with the Macan and also  \\nMaserati  with the gracale  one of the observations  that I have  here with the f-pace  is that for a crossover  \\nthat you would  think  is all luxury  it does  have  Dynamic  handling  characteristics  and qualities  here where  \\nthe steering is certainly responsive but also well nudge of the wheel and it\\'s already taking the corner  \\nwhich is something I really wasn\\'t expecting here for this crossover because with the P250 you think all  \\nright turbo 4 you do get really high quality materials for the interior soft ride quality also a quiet cabin  \\nand that\\'s usually a recipe for a vehicle that isn\\'t going to have a bad side to it and yet this is a very  \\npleasant  vehicle  to drive  around  it doesn\\'t  hide that it does  have  some  sporty  driving  characteristics  and \\na sporty personality which is something I can really appreciate as an Enthusiast as someone who loves  \\ndriving so in Dynamic mode right off the line [Music] not bad not bad at all what I noticed is that  \\nDynamic mode actually changes up the driving experience which some vehicles that have a turbo 4  \\ndon\\'t really give you that it\\'s more like a fake sport experience but what I have noticed is that the  \\npowertrain and the engine performs very quickly al so the gear shifts are more aggressive also that  \\nengine note does get a bit louder if you have really nice paddle shifters that are very high quality feel  \\nvery premium in the hands and again that\\'s something that you would experience from a Jaguar just  \\nbeing  a brand  is all about  luxury  but also that performance  as well so again  even  though  you\\'re  going  to \\nsay well Mike you know we\\'re spending maybe an extra 10 to 15 grand for an f -pace over some of the  \\ncompetitors but you are getting a vehicle where the interior quality is one step above everyone else in  \\n\\nthis segment also really nice leather wrapped steering wheel as well with aggressive 10 -2 positions but  \\nalso supportive nine and three positions everything else about the interior is really driver Centric and  \\nDriver  focused  I love the infotainment  system  that is placed  well within  reach  also you still have  physical  \\ndials for the climb control settings and it\\'s very minimalistic but it\\'s minimalistic in a way where it doesn\\'t  \\nfeel as though this vehicle is giving you a cheaper or unrefined experience you als o have plenty of  \\nshoulder room as well with the wide center console but what I will say this is that the f -pace does get  \\noverlooked in many regards I think maybe it has something to do with the pricing but again you\\'re  \\nbuying this vehicle for the experience and what it brings to the table overall but from a practicality  \\nstandpoint it\\'s one of the most spacious vehicles in this market and price range it\\'s not something you  \\nwould really think when you look at this vehicle from the outside because it does have  that sportier rear  \\nfascia it does have that lower roof line it\\'s a crossover that\\'s typical for a premium luxury brand that  \\ndoesn\\'t want to deviate too far away from its performance heritage and yet what Jaguar has done here  \\nis given you a vehicle that also feels very upscale but still even in its most basic form has handling  \\ncharacteristics that is certainly going to inspire a lot of confidence on back roads [Music] I am in  \\nDynamic mode are at highway speeds so for a crossover with a 0 -60 time of around 6 .9 seconds this  \\ncertainly  feels  on par with a lot of other  turbocharged  force  on engine  powered  vehicles  in this market  in \\nfact I think Jaguar is really underrating the performance of this vehicle severely because it doesn\\'t feel  \\nslow or lethargic when you compare the f -pace to some of its closest Rivals that are not mainstream  \\nlike that Volvo XC60 like the Genesis gb70 with the turbo 4 or even the Porsche Macan the jaguar  \\nf-pace  in my mind  still has that Dynamic  feel more  so than the Volvo  XC60  but also has the comfort  and \\nthe luxury that would match what you get with the Porsche Macan so what Jaguar is banking on here  \\nand what they\\'ve always done too for their entirety of their history is that they\\'re giving you a vehicle  \\nwhere it\\'s Unique it\\'s really more of an individualized experience that you\\'re not going to find from  \\nmaybe  BMW  Audi or Mercedes -Benz  it\\'s a bit more  specific  and it\\'s a bit more  special  than what  we see \\nfrom other mainstream rivals now at highway speeds it has a nice composure on the roadways even  \\nwith the larger tire size now if you are looking for Comfort I would go with the 19s but with the 21s I  \\ndon\\'t think the ride quality is diminished at all so ultimately after this test drive the Jaguar f -pace threw  \\nsome curveballs today which I\\'m pleasantly surprised and I\\'m glad to see because with the P250 I had  \\na perception of this vehicle before taking it out on the roadways I\\'m thinking okay it\\'s gonna feel l ike a  \\nlot of non -performance oriented models in this market and price range is probably not going to feel  \\nDynamic it\\'s probably going to lean very heavily towards being a luxury vehicle and yet it\\'s a crossover  \\nthat\\'s classy but has a bad side to it and that\\'s something that I think a lot of buyers are going to enjoy  \\nthat it\\'s not just going to be luxury all time it\\'s not just going to be upscale and availa has more of a  \\nlaid-back demeanor it\\'s a vehicle that you can have some fun with on the roadways and to a blast to  \\ndrive on your weekly commutes so to wrap up my time with the 2023 Jaguar f -pace what are my final  \\nthoughts and takeaways for this luxury crossover compared to most rivals in this market the f -pace has  \\nGrand Tour like Tendencies from the exterior to the interior and also the driving Dynamics what I really  \\nlike about this vehicle is that yes Jaguar is a premium luxury manufacturer but they also didn\\'t deviate  \\ntoo far away from their Heritage with this crossover where the driving Dynamics even with the  \\nturbocharged force on the engine is very engaging but also the handling is Snappy and very fluid and  \\nit\\'s exactly what you would expect from a vehicle that is really taking a lot of the same characteristics  \\nand DNA that we see from the F -type and other sporty vehicles from the Jaguar brand but also this  \\nvehicle can double as being a great family crossover but also a comfortable and upscale daily driver  \\nwhere the int erior quality is certainly memorable also of course if you go with the Windsor leather seats  \\nyou\\'re  going  to have  an experience  that\\'s  very similar  to what  we see from the Porsche  Macan  and also \\nthe new Maserati gracale also I love the fact that the interior layout is simplistic but everything is within  \\nArm\\'s Reach but still done so in a way where you don\\'t feel as though this vehicle has an interior that  \\nreflects a price point of maybe 40 or 50 000 this does feel very much like a sixty five thousand dollar  \\ncrossover also it is very practical with the amount of cargo space you have behind the second row  \\nseats but also the interior spacing as well for both up front and that second row But ultimately  it boils  \\ndown to the complete package that the f -pace is providing where it can be fun and engaging when you  \\npop it in Dynamic mode and you\\'re going to have the stiffer handling you\\'re going to have a vehicle that  \\ncan perform quite well even with the turbocharged four -cylinder engine but at the same time you also  \\n\\nhave the interior Comfort where you don\\'t want to leave this vehicle on a longer Drive live even for  \\nmyself after doing a 30 minute test drive I want to continue on and that\\'s something I don\\'t normally say  \\nfor a lot of vehicles in this market but also as Jaguar has moved in the crossover Direction what I can  \\nreally appreciate is that this crossover does feel like a sedan it feels like a sports car and it\\'s great to  \\nsee that Jaguar didn\\'t deviate too far away from their Heritage where the f -pace is a comple tely foreign  \\nvehicle to somebody who has purchased an XF or an XE or other vehicles that Jaguar has offered for  \\nthe past 20 or 30 years and that\\'s one thing I think a lot of buyers have certainly appreciated and  \\nenjoyed  about  the f-pace  so guys  thank  you so much  for watching  this video  please  like comment  share  \\nand subscribe for more also make sure to follow me on Instagram at Boston Autoblog so you can see  \\nwhat I\\'m up to and what vehicles I\\'ll be featuring in the future and I will see you guys next time  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2023 F -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nso we\\'re going to get up and get our acceleration here hey everyone it\\'s ben hardy here and instead  \\nthey\\'re going to be reviewing a jaguar f -pace s first and foremost though a huge shout out thank you to  \\nthe jaguar here in downtown so like for giving me some time with this fps this one is available for sale  \\nfor the time being so if you\\'re interested i\\'ll include a link to their website in the description down below  \\ndefinitely check them out and then on a side note if you save time money the next time purchase car  \\nlink to my car buying guide in the description down below as well let\\'s get into it [Music] u nder the hood  \\nwe have a turbocharged 2 -liter four -cylinder that goes through an 8 -speed automatic transmission fuel  \\neconomy is 22 around 10 and then 27 on the highway with power plus being 246 horsepower and then  \\n269 pound -feet of torque now the reason i\\'m showing you guys the key fob instead of my normal  \\ntransition clip is because this has the cool function where you can turn the lights on and off with the key  \\nfob which is definitely fun first off i love this blue it definitely pops out quite a bit and it\\' s way more  \\nexciting than what you normally see on f paces which is usually like white or gray or silver just like most  \\nother cars you guys can see here with the distinctive lines on the hood and then coming down below  \\nnotice here with the daytime lights and again if i pop on the headlight and then you can see with the  \\nparking  sensor  and the venting  off to the side and then notice  here with the grille  all blacked  out with the \\njaguar  logo front and center  and then more  parking  sensors  here at the bottom  and well there\\'s  the front \\nend come  around  the side here tar and wheel  setup  is 265 40 22 in the front and over in the rear as well \\nand then notice how the wheel is all blacked out and look at the spoke design it\\'s very interesting like  \\nfrom a distance it looks like you\\'re really just like large spokes and then you kind of zoom in a little bit  \\nand it changes quite a bit notice here with the jaguar logo there on this black piece of trim and then if  \\nwe take a few steps back most everything is body paint including  the mirrors and the door handles but  \\nobviously you got the black on the wheels and then also look at the body work there on the bottom how  \\nthat is also black to create some contrast here\\'s a key fob yet again and we\\'re going to hold down that  \\nbutton right there and this will pop open the rear hatch notice that little cover comes up with the hatch  \\nwe have a little jaguar bag here on the back lots of lots of stuff that comes with this car brand new and  \\nyou guys can see here with the seats you can fold those down if you want and i love these like metallic  \\nplaques here down below i think those look fantastic and last but not least if we pick this up it\\'s pretty  \\nheavy  spare  tire is just underneath  the loading  floor and then when  you\\'re  all done  just press  that button  \\nright there and that\\'ll lower your thing down clean the cargo cover that\\'s already built into the hatch now  \\nfinishing things up with the rest of the rear notice the spoiler here at the top again finished in blue then  \\nwe have the signature f -pace tail lights with another blacked out jaguar logo and then f -pace down  \\nbelow parking sensors here at the bottom with more blacked out trims so basically the whole bottom of  \\nthe car is black and then the whole top is pretty much blue now here\\'s the rear do or panel notice with  \\nthe leather trim at the top and then the wood trim down below that and then more leather trim down  \\nbelow that and then look at the metallic trim just so many different elements to take in meridian sound  \\nsystem it\\'s got some speakers for that and then here the seats which are a lot more simplistic than the  \\n\\ndoor panel it was perforated all down the center portion and then popping in really easy to get in here\\'s  \\nyour legroom headroom and then you guys can see with the storage pocket we\\'ve got some vents right  \\nthere and then we have our charge port then cupholder armrest set up and let\\'s head to the front now  \\nhere\\'s the front door panel notice with the leather trim at the top and then again the wood trim down  \\nbelow just like the back definitely a really beautiful looking door panel and look at the controls for t he \\nwindows that\\'s definitely nice and fancy looking all of the adjustments for the mirrors taking a lot of stuff  \\nout of the range rover lineup is what i\\'m noticing blind spot lighting for the mirrors and then here are the  \\nseats and us with the jaguar logo there that\\'s pretty cool and then perforated all down the center of  \\nthese seats and then we do have our power adjustments right there jaguar logo yet again pretty normal  \\npedal layout and that is for the hatch and then more leather trim here on the dash and  let\\'s pop in nice  \\nnow here\\'s the steering wheel notice we\\'ve got that beautiful two -tone design that\\'s in other parts of the  \\ninterior and then we\\'ve got these really nice paddle shifters here on the back we\\'ve got controls for  \\nphone controls voice command controls cruise control heated steering button on the other side and just  \\nall of it together  looks  fantastic  turn signal  slash  light stock  windshield  wiper  stock  and that\\'s  the ends  of \\nthe stocks are also very nice from material standpoint now here\\'s the gauge custard\\'s half analog half  \\ndigital and i love how like it bleeds into each other i think that\\'s pretty interesting from an aesthetic  \\nperspective we do have a bunch of different menus we can scroll through just like other jaguars land  \\nrover models so if you\\'ve been in any of those vehicles within the last couple years this is going to look  \\nvery familiar to you and overall i think they did a good job with the design there now here\\'s the  \\ninfotainment system first off if we pop in reverse we do have a backup camera with trajectory lines that \\nturn with the steering wheel and yeah i can even change the camera viewpoint there which is always  \\nfun now aside from that with the rest  infotainment system first off you\\'ve got the  shortcut bar here on  \\nthe side and then notice here with the main screen response time is fantastic pretty easy to use overall  \\nand you guys  can see the different  tabs that we can go into with that now down  below  in this area we\\'ve  \\ngot a bunch of different shortcut buttons here so like if i press this button and by the way af ter like fully  \\npress in this will pull up stuff for the seats i love how it says just seat heat but the seats are heated and  \\ncooled which is kind of interesting but you can also control a bunch of things with these controls so  \\npush in that\\'s for the seats and notice i have the ac seat function on right now push again and then  \\nthat\\'ll  go back  to the temperature  and then pull it and that\\'ll  give you fan speed  and then push  it and that \\nwill put you back to the main menu and so yeah really cool how they are basically throwing a bunch of  \\ncontrols into one area to keep the minimalist design here and then we do have a wireless phone  \\ncharger notice here at the stop start button and the volume control i\\'m glad they have like a volume  \\ncontrol  so you can just go to a physical  button  don\\'t  have  to do everything  in the screen  and then notice  \\nthe shifter as well we do have our off -road cruise control and then we\\'ve got stability control and then  \\nwith the drive mode select so you push this and then this will allow you to change the drive modes they  \\ndo pop up here in the center so we\\'ve got quite a few drive modes so you can see we\\'ve got a comfort  \\nwe have  a dynamic  on the one side and then on the other  side we\\'ve  got an eco rain and ice and snow  i \\nguess it\\'s all into one mode so four modes they keep it pretty straightforward here\\'s the center console  \\nfirst off we pulled  it back  we\\'ve  got a couple  of cup holders  and then 12 volts right there  nice leather  trim \\nand then there\\'s  a storage  cubby  underneath  here on the center  console  with some  nice metallic  trim all \\naround it center console this muse piece then we\\'ve got the glove box and notice the material used  \\nhere on the dash just very top -notch stuff and then we do have a center of here at the very top it\\'s a full  \\npanoramic got the controls for it right there and that\\'s all so first off blue fire blue that\\'s a pretty blue  \\nname for this blue color anyways standard equipment and then warranty which is a five -year 60 000  \\nmile that\\'s pretty dang good uh and then over here on the optional equipment side you can see the  \\nbase price four options fifty four thousand and then this paint color actually for a cool special paint color  \\nis pretty inexpensive sometimes you see pretty expensive paint colors with some of these custom paint  \\njobs anyways that\\'s the equipment total msrp 65 875 let\\'s see how it drives let\\'s go over visibility before  \\nwe set off here\\'s  your visibility  over the hood  and through  both of the mirrors  then throughout  the rest of \\nthe rear and let\\'s set off so setting off in the f -pace s and honestly i am super i mpressed it\\'s actually  \\nbeen quite some time since i have reviewed uh any uh f -paces or just a jaguar model in general and i  \\nforgot  how nice these  are i and that\\'s  the thing  that\\'s  the thing  that like happens  with his car review  stuff \\nbut sometimes you don\\'t see a car for a while and you\\'re like wow i forgot how nice that thing was and  \\n\\nyeah  that\\'s  definitely  what  happened  uh today  and that\\'s  why i try to review  cars uh as often  as possible  \\nso i can stay uh you know up to date and everything on all of it so first off really smooth from a ride  \\nquality perspective and it looks like this one i didn\\'t see the window sticker but it looks like it has a solar  \\nattenuating windshield which kind of like an interesting thing you can like see a little weave in the  \\nwindshield itself that person totally just ran a red light okay um every single time i r eview cars here in  \\ndowntown so like something always happens that\\'s on the gopro it\\'s always funny uh other stuff sea  \\ncomfort\\'s great i\\'m so glad this has air -conditioned seats because it\\'s a pretty toasty day it says 104  \\ndegrees on the thermostat right there so uh yeah actually that\\'s pretty uncomfortable so nice that i\\'m  \\ncomfortable right and other stuff here noise installation pretty dang good and this turbocharged  \\nfour-cylinder is doing a pretty solid job here at elevation that\\'s for sure i love the feel of um the turn  \\nsignals just that end piece obviously the rest of the stock\\'s plastic but you don\\'t really touch the rest of  \\nthe stock most the time but that end piece you know having some nice trim on it definitely makes me  \\nfeel like i\\'m doing something premium every single time i turn on the turn signal oh there\\'s a rivien over  \\nthere starting to see those all the time now but let\\'s pop it into gotta push the dial so  i can pop it over  \\ninto dynamic there we go so we\\'re gonna get up and get our acceleration here this thing moves this  \\nthing definitely moves now i\\'m interested to see with the uh gear shifts here with this strip to put down  \\ninto s mode for wait s mode oh there we go so to put an s mod to do the manual shifts oh yeah the  \\ntransmission\\'s super snappy so do i yeah go back to the drive and that puts back in automatic mode  \\ninteresting um paddle shifters are also really nice from material standpoint again everything you touch  \\nin this car feels really nice and so fully summing things up i think the f -pace looks great this definite ly \\ndrives sportier compared to it\\'s like land rover counterparts those kind of go more on the luxury  \\noff-roader side of things whereas this goes more on the sport side of things so if you want a sporter  \\nsporter sportier on -road driving experience this gives that to you and also this pretty much at this point  \\nthey used to kind of differentiate the brands a little bit more at the interior this is all land rover at this  \\npoint which i have no complaints about whatsoever like i am completely fine with that because in  \\ngeneral the jaguar models are usually less expensive than their land rover equivalents and so t his also  \\nkind of is like a value play at the same time because like if you ch like cover this up the steering wheel  \\nwith the controls the paddle shifters the infotainment system the minimalist controls down here like this  \\nis all new land rover like this is the same stuff that you see in the new full -size land rover that is a you  \\nknow  over six figures  so really  good  value  and i like uh the updates  that they\\'ve  done  here to the f-pace  \\nto just make this interior feel a little more high quality and just a littl e bit more modern overall that\\'s  \\nbecause something\\'s up for our video on this jaguar f -pace s again a huge shout -out thank you to the  \\njaguar here in downtown salt lake for giving me some time with this vehicle check out the info in the  \\ndescription down below i\\'ll see ya  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2023 F -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nforeign [Music] ladies and gentlemen my name is Ty behind the camera and this is the 2023 Jaguar  \\nf-pace this one happens to be in the S trim and we are taking a look at a beautiful Portofino blue on  \\nCaraway tan interior uh beautiful vehicle let\\'s take a look at today we\\'re going to be detailing all of the  \\nfeatures on the exterior as well as interior and we\\'re also going to take it out for a test drive towards the  \\nend of the video so stay tuned with us and we\\'re going to start off with the features of the exterior first  \\noff we have full LED headlamps as standard on every single f -pace for 2023 it\\'s the high and low  \\nbeams as well as the daytime running lights and turn signals are all illuminated you could see very nice  \\num all lit up we also have headlight washers up up there as well we have some very nice subt le \\nChrome accents found throughout the vehicle mainly on the front with the side grilles and on the front  \\nmain Grille very beautiful looking main Grille to this vehicle but we do have parking sensors that span  \\nthe front bumper as well as the rear bumper and to round it all off at the very bottom we have led fog  \\nlights again looks very nice all illuminated yeah very nice looking Grille you can see the details and  \\n\\nthere we also have the Jaguar logo front and center the very nice creases that round out the hood that  \\ngo down into the Grille and some very nice optional wheels that measure up at 20 inches as you can  \\nsee the tires measure  255 50 up front and a very nice bi-color  design  for the wheels  we have  some  nice \\nelements  towards  the side and the with the Jaguar  logo as well Chrome  surrounding  the and some  nice \\npainted silver accents down at the bottom of the doors and your silver roof rails and we\\'re gonna make  \\nsunroof up top and the shark fin antennas up there too if we take a look towards the side mirrors we  \\ncan see we have the blind spot warning and the turn signal indicators you also have smart key entry on  \\nall four of the door handles just press to lock and put your hand behind the handle to unlock again it  \\ngoes for all four doors see this particular car stickers for 61 430 and we do have a couple of optiona l \\nextras on this vehicle including the cold climate pack which we definitely need today is a quite cold day  \\nhere in Connecticut I have a nice spoiler up here with again the Sharks antenna like you saw earlier  \\nand same up front same as up front we have led rear lights as well so the turn signals tail lights and  \\nbrake lights are all LED on a very nice all lit up parking sensors again back here and a couple of  \\nbadges such as the f -pace badge another Jaguar badging with the third wiper up top and down below  \\nthe trunk release and the reversing camera and we also do have some hidden exhaust tips for that  \\nturbocharged four cylinder so what we think of the styling on the f -pace I personally have always loved  \\nthe look of this car ever since it came out and it\\'s a very nice design Evolution with the sort of same  \\ngeneration but definitely a facelift on that so let\\'s discuss some of our drivetrain options since there are  \\nactually three different Motors you can get with the f -pace as of 2023 so accompanying us today in th e \\nS trim level as well as the basic F -Type trim is a two liter turbocharged in line four this produces 247  \\nhorsepower 269 pound -feet of torque then we also have the r Dynamic s which is the next trim level up  \\nthat will have a three liter turbocharged inline six cylinder with 395 horsepower and 405 pounds of  \\ntorque and then we have sort of the crazy uh trim level the svr that has a five liter supercharger V8 with  \\n542 horsepower and 516 pound -feet of torque that is going to be quite the Bonkers SUV but for to day \\nwe have more of the normal subdued powertrain uh which has plenty of power and we will figure out  \\nhow that does on our test drive Loop other bits of information the drive is standard across the f -pace  \\nrange and you also get an 8 -speed automatic regardless of engine choice okay so we do have a full  \\npowered liftgate with the F case and once it\\'s opened up we have a pretty good amount of space in  \\nthere take a look at that lots and lots of goodies that come with this particular f -pace and a bit of  \\naccessori es such as coat hangers and and things of that nature uh but yeah once you open it up good  \\namount of space in here you even have grocery bag hangers to either side over here and towards the  \\nback some Led illumination again on either side and uh some storage extensions as well you also get  \\nthis very nice all -weather mat and when you lift that up you of course have the carpeting and a bit of  \\nextra space underneath with all of your tire changing goodies underneath that we of course have a  \\ncargo shade that clos es down with the trunk and as you can see if you\\'re feeling strong you can close  \\ndown the trunk with these handles or simply just press the button let\\'s start off the interior with the rear  \\nseats namely the rear doors beautiful appointment on this interior for this vehicle I think it\\'s just a a  \\nreally really nice color combination the dark blue and the sort of Light tan leather interior nice soft to the  \\ntouch  materials  up here with uh sort of the same  color  stitching  a very nice sort of wood  grain  as well as \\nlots of just bright work on the inside of this car with these speaker grilles and the door grabs and also  \\nsome more speaker accents down below but just take a look at this color you know it\\'s not a really light  \\ntan and it\\'s also not a brown it\\'s a very nice uh sort of in between to those two colors I think it looks  \\nbeautiful I have the window switch and a bit of storage towards the bottom of course a couple of  \\nspeakers on the door nice little stainless steel entryway and here is our rear seat very n ice looking you  \\ncan also fold down  the rear headrest  as you can see the passenger  size fold down  like that to get some  \\nmore visibility out of the um the rear window you can also fold down the rear seats with this little switch  \\nright there as you can see they fold down flat you could fold down the pass -through with a little button  \\nright next to the center headrest and that of course will gain access to the trunk and uh if you needed a  \\ncombination of cargo space and um the passenger space back here then that definitely has you  \\ncovered and one more thing we can fold down is the center armrest and that has a couple of cup  \\nholders to a normal driving position for myself and I stand at five foot ten so just a frame of reference I  \\ndo have a nice couple of inches of legroom back here for myself you also have these sort of accessory  \\nhooks to put in place uh coat hangers and things like that the Jaguar will provide for you we have a  \\n\\ncouple of air vents back here a little bit of storage and a 12 volt power outlet nice small drivetrain hump  \\ntoo so if you had this fit a center passenger back here you definitely can heated rear seats of course  \\nare available but  not equipped on  this particular  vehicle we have  led illumination back  here and  the \\ngrab handles and a very nice large panoramic sunroof as you can see in conjunction with the rear  \\nheadrests it continues very very nicely in a very very beautiful view of the front dashboard alrighty the  \\ndriver\\'s door is very similarly appointed as the rear so that is good nice and soft to touch leatherette up  \\nhere and the leather starts on our armrest nice wood and bright work just like out back on the handles  \\nwe have the lock unlock for the door locks of course we have the window switches and our power  \\nmirror adjustments they also do our our power folding and also have powered child locks for the rear a  \\nbit more of storage up front as well and on the left of the dash we have an air vent with a nice bit of  \\nleather trimming and stitching over here we have a couple of controls to release the rear trunk and also  \\na gauge dimmer down here we have some pretty neat looking pedals covered in rubber and our hood  \\nrelease right over here very nice quality to the carpeting and a jaguar dorsell just a very very beautiful  \\ncolor for the interior and you even get the jaguar cat embossed and the headrest lots and lots of  \\nstitching and perforations on the seat as well a very very supportive seat and of course we have all the  \\nnormal controls in addition to four -way lumbar [Music] okay so here goes the key for the F Pace we  \\nhave  a nice Jaguar  script  on the rear of the key we also have  the physical  key on the inside  in case  you \\nneeded to use that we also have a lock unlock button on the top the ability to turn on the exterior light s \\nfrom the key five so you kind of locate your car in a busy parking lot you can also Pop the trunk and  \\nalso a panic alarm too so lots of functionalities on the key fob and it\\'s very nice looking as well we of  \\ncourse have push buttons start right next to the shifter [Music] and all of the buttons so I should say a  \\ngood portion of the buttons on this vehicle kind of hide away until you turn the vehicle on and then they  \\nwill kind of appear with some very nice lighting um they\\'re sort of a backlit uh almost capacitive touch  \\nbutton for kind of all of the buttons within the interior so let\\'s get a focus on this beautiful looking  \\nsteering wheel I really like how they continued that a beige tan color onto the steering wheel it looks  \\nvery very beautiful and modern we have all of our voice command buttons as well as Bluetooth  \\nTelephone controls and all of the controls for the LCD portion of the gauge cluster in there as well we  \\nwill get through how to configure that gauge cluster in just a minute and to the other side we have our  \\nheated steer wheel button which of course we will turn on we have our lane guidance control and all of  \\nour adaptive cruise control settings as well on the right side very nice large paddle shifters mounted to  \\nthe steering wheel as you see couple of stalks towards the back one for your automatic lighting here  \\nturn signals as well as front and rear fog lamps we also have an informational button at the end of  the \\nstock again to configure the screen and our other stock is of course used for our front and rear wipers  \\nthat brings  me up to the LCD gauge  cluster  so a good  portion  of the speedometer  or I should  say gauge  \\nhousing is an LCD screen so you can kind of see from this sort of box right here is all LCD and the rest  \\nis kind of like an analog speedometer and uh um rev counter as well so mainly we\\'ll be using these  \\nbuttons as well as the scroll wheel to configure that screen up there in addition to the button a t the end  \\nof the stock so if you press that kind of various um sir trip settings mostly will pop up at the top of the  \\ndash as you see you know kind of real time miles per gallon the date and time things like that distance  \\nto empty for your fuel and all that good stuff but let\\'s take a look at how we can configure this main  \\nscreen so to start configuring you just press in the scroll wheel and then you can scroll down to sort of  \\nconfigure what you see in the center in a sort of main screen which is pretty nea t can also scroll over to  \\nget various trip information media and audio controls various different warnings or tire pressure  \\ninformations and that\\'s pretty neat so if we go down to a kind of combination between media and  \\ndriver\\'s assistance that\\'ll kind of change up your sort of I guess you could say home screen for the  \\ninstrument  cluster  up here upper  Dash  is very nicely  appointed  with some  stitching  a couple  of air vents  \\nright in the center we have the hazards button and that brings me down to our infotainment screen nice  \\nlarge touchscreen very clear and also very easy to get used to if you\\'re not so familiar with the screen  \\nso first of all let\\'s check out the navigation screen so we have the map over here and then kind of you  \\ninput your destination right up top we have our phone screen as well as the radio which is kind of what  \\nis playing at the moment we have our presets and all of the stations if we scroll over it kind o f um \\nenlargens our home screen I guess you could say to a energy impact screen which is pretty neat you  \\ncan kind of Select various informations towards the bottom but we have a kind of driving Style energy  \\n\\nimpact screen and I\\'ll kind of show you what is taking up energy within your vehicle so we have the  \\nheated steering wheel on that\\'s taken a bit and and the climate controls is taking a bit of energy this  \\nalso will give you some economical tips to get you a little bit better gas mileage and you also have a  \\nhistory of your recent driving pretty neat screen there we can also go over to our settings where we can  \\nadjust the brightness of the gauges and the screen we have different themes so we can kind of turn i t \\ninto a dark theme or kind of like automatic and we\\'ll go with the headlights we also have the auto brake  \\nfunction which you can turn on and off as well as the start stop we can also adjust various things with  \\nour home screen kind of take out or add a different uh tiles there we have all of our audio settings and  \\nall of our sort of settings  for the entire  vehicle  you can also quickly  pull up our parking  camera  which  we \\ndo have the wide angle rear view as well as the parking sensors activated so press this button over  \\nhere which will kind of give us a jumpilation of our apps one more thing I wanted to show you was the  \\ncabin lighting screen and this is where you kind of configure your ambient Lighting in this vehicle so  \\nvery neat sort of uh sort of shows  that or pictures  that go along  with each  color  and you can also kind of \\ncreate your own color with the ambient lighting so pretty neat there going back and activate various  \\nthings  like your valet  mode  get some  economical  driving  data your voice  commands  and things  like that \\nwe also have  a all-service  information  kind of shows  you what  the all-wheel  drive  system  is doing  in real \\ntime and then this also gives you sort of information based upon each driving mode this vehicle has get  \\ninto that in just a minute but that pretty much does it for the main screen very easy to get used to you  \\nknow you can\\'t get lost in all the menus and things like that like some other infotainment screens but  \\nnonetheless very nice looking and very functional down here of course we have our Dual Zone climate  \\ncontrol so we have these two knobs which are multi -function so just as is you can turn them and it w ill \\nadjust your temperature if you press them in that will control your heated seats on this reticular car or if  \\nit was equipped it will cooled with will also function with the cooled seats pushing it again back to our  \\ntemperatures and if you pull it towards you that will adjust your fan speed pretty neat solution to kind of  \\nclean up the climate control but still very easy to get used to right over here we have our seat heating  \\nscreen so if you didn\\'t want to press the knob in you just kind of pull it up he re we also have an  \\nautomatic function and sync for the climate control over there very nice heated windscreen which is a  \\nvery very nice feature to have in the winter especially up here in New England of course the defroster  \\nfor the rear and your AC settings and the front defrost as well down here we have a wireless charging  \\npad for your phone this brings me down to a small Center stack here which is a few buttons it of course  \\nhas that start stop button the audio volume knob which is pretty neatly styled and  this is our gear  \\nselector again for that eight speed automatic so it\\'s kind of like a suede material with some stitching  \\nthere\\'s an unlock at the back and you could press it forward for reverse which of course will activate  \\nyour reversing camera with the guidance lines and all the way down into drive you can also bump it  \\nover like so into a sport  mode  and that is when  you can start shifting  with your paddle  shifters  there  and \\nthen we also have a nice big p for Park pretty cool solution here for the driving modes you kind of press  \\nthis button in and that will kind of activate your different driving modes in the center cluster so of course  \\nwe have a dynamic normal comfort and the Eco and then sort of a rain ice and snow mode which is  \\npretty  cool so we kind of leave  it into comfort  for now and push  the button  right back  in so it\\'s either  side \\nof mind we also have a sort of uh button right here to uh sort of like a hill descent cont rol and we can  \\nalso turn on and off your attraction control over here we can slide this back and we have a couple of  \\nnicely sized cup holders and also stand up your phone right in here a little uh tray right here to put  \\nvarious smaller objects maybe lose change and things like that I have a 12 volt power outlet and a  \\npretty nice center console lid you can lift that up you can see we have all the connections available to  \\nyou in this in the vehicle so we have a good combination of 12 volt power outlets they a lso have a  \\nnormal style USB and a USBC with a pretty deep storage console in there and that brings me over to  \\nthe passenger area they have a nice slab of the leather and wood trim and a lockable glove box open  \\nthat it\\'s kind of a bin style and pretty good amount of room in there it\\'s all felt lined with a pen holder too  \\ntake a look towards the top we have our frameless rear view mirror with the garage door Home links  \\nyou have  three  of those  and up at our Center  stack  we have  a couple  of buttons  up here for the sunroof  \\nand sun shade so two separate buttons for both so we could see the sun shade does open very nicely  \\nthat\\'s a little bit I would say it\\'s more translucent that\\'s a little bit of light in and will roll all the way back  \\nwith a sunglass storage back here and the other button is used to vent or slide back the glass board of  \\n\\nthe sunroof there\\'s some various controls to either side over here like an SOS button also like a sort of  \\na maintenance button we also have led tap lights on the interior too and now that the sun shade has  \\nopened completely with a very large section up front that opens and a nice smaller section for the rear  \\npassengers  to round  things  off we of course  have  these  sun visors  you can\\'t forget  about  that they have  \\nthe card holders and a mirror and Light but that pretty much does it for the features section of t his \\nreview let\\'s get it out on the road and see how it drives all righty let\\'s see what it\\'s like to drive the  \\nJaguar f -pace really really beautiful vehicle I\\'m thoroughly impressed with this car just the way it looks  \\nand the color combination on this car kind of a sucker for dark blue exteriors and a nice tan or brown  \\nInteriors  so we do have  a nice little driving  route  planned  out for you not a very large  test drive  since  we \\nare in a city setting uh the capital of Connecticut we are in Hartford so lots of City driving going around  \\naround here but that is good for you guys then uh do live around the city or in the city uh every once in  \\na while so you get to see how this car is light to light we\\'ll also get an acceleration clip and kind of get a  \\ngood feel on how it handles now right off the bat this car does ride a very nice just taking it over the  \\nsmaller bumps down here uh you know the the suspension soaks them u p very nicely and already I  \\ncould tell this is more of a comfort rather than sport uh tuned suspension now the seats too are very  \\ncomfortable  we have  four-way lumbar  which  helps  out with that Comfort  level and the Turbo  4 seems  to \\nhave pretty good load down power and is also very quiet and smooth I have to say that the eight -speed  \\ntransmission is definitely helping out with that smoothness as well you barely hear the four cylinder  \\nupon acceleration which is pretty awesome it\\'s almost non -existent the the gasoline mode almost feels  \\nlike you\\'re driving an electric car when you\\'re just coasting because you don\\'t hear the gasoline engine  \\nwhatsoever and you also really don\\'t feel anything at all you know even on an idle you know most the  \\ntime you know with any other car you\\'ll get a very subtle vibration but you know even on this just  \\nholding onto the steering wheel or holding onto anything in the interior it is just a very smooth  \\nfour-cylinder anyway we go steering actually has a pretty quick ratio too which is pretty nice for the city  \\nand also the back roads you can kind of carve along on the fun sort of turns and whatnot I am kind of  \\nBlown Away by just how quiet is in here there\\'s really you know up at 45 to 50 miles an hour there is  \\nvirtually no tire noise put it down into the dynamic mode and we will get an acceleration clip get it to 25  \\nmiles an hour and kind of mash the throttle that way we\\'ll see how fast the transmission rea cts and how  \\nfast it can get up to speed so we are at 25 and yeah so really pretty Swift acceleration from this f -pace  \\nwith the 2 -liter turbo a nice little corner here yeah definitely a pretty direct steering for this car and uh  \\nthe suspension does hold its own switch it back to comfort so yeah pretty impressed with the  \\nacceleration uh you know the eight speed did a quick enough job of switching up our gears so that we  \\nare in the Power Band and uh you know other other SUVs in this segment might have a little  bit more  \\nhorsepower uh but I can tell you that the 247 this car produces is plenty uh for me at least and if it\\'s not  \\nfor you then the I also have the turbocharged in line six and The Supercharged V8 on top of this engine  \\nChoice uh which uh should definitely suit anybody\\'s needs but uh yeah to wrap up the F Pace I really  \\nreally do like this car and the overall design on the exterior looks very sporty and classy and the same  \\nthing with the interior uh just looking at this steering wheel it\\'s just probably o ne of the most beautiful  \\nsteering wheels on the market especially with that color matching the interior color of this car but yeah  \\nplenty of features uh plenty of power and very impressive Dynamics out on the road so you know the  \\nfast steering and the very quiet engine and the very quiet ride too so yeah pretty impressive all the way  \\naround with this f -pace to round out the video I hope you have enjoyed the f -pace just as much as I  \\nhave and I also hope you stay with us here at tide drives for more videos ju st like this one  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2021 I -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nJaguar is going all in on electrification it\\'s i -pace SUV was way ahead of the curve back in 2018  \\nFormula E is its only Factory Motorsport program and it plans to become a fully electric brand by 2025.  \\n[Music] SBR and it\\'s the hottest version of Jaguar\\'s biggest and best SUV you get a Supercharged V8  \\n\\nengine indulgent leather interior and a super agile chassis that\\'s stickier than a just stop oil protester  \\nwith a two for one on the super  glue a festival  car isn\\'t just borrowing  this one for a week  we\\'ve  had it on \\nour long term Fleet for over 6 000 miles now so that means we\\'re not just dealing with the honeymoon  \\nperiod here we can really dig in to the day -to-day get down to that nitty -gritty what this car is like to live  \\nwith so if you\\'re a hot Prospect for the FPS svr here are six things I think you\\'ll want answering so do I  \\nhave to buy the facelift well the svr came out in 2018 and when it did we read it really highly but things  \\nhave moved on since then and in 2021 we got the facelift and with that you did get a l ot of worthwhile  \\nupgrades Under the Skin you get re -tuned dampers and a tweaked edif plus a new steering rack brake  \\nbooster and some suspension Hardware including different bushes the five liter Supercharged V8  \\ndoesn\\'t get any extra power but it still makes 542 brake horsepower and this 15 pound foot of extra  \\ntorque for 516 pound foot all in there\\'s also a tougher torque converter on the project 8 Saloon and that  \\nactually drops the note to 60 from 4.1 to 3.8 seconds I think the biggest reason to go for the facelift  \\nthough is the new infotainment system which we\\'ll get onto in a minute but don\\'t dismiss the pre -facelift  \\ncars I went on a well -known classified site there\\'s 43 of them available and they start from 50 000  \\npounds with around 20 000 miles on so give them these cars now start from 85 000 that is really good  \\nvalue  so is it fast and is the mpg really  terrible  well fast yes it is this is an extremely  rapid  car is the mpg \\nterrible well that depends what your expectations are let\\'s start with the five liter Supercharged V8 it is  \\nthe Zenith of jaguars AJ V8 engine and all other unit designed by Jaguar before Ford bought the  \\ncompany it used to be made at Ford\\'s Bridge end assembly plant it\\'s now produced in -house by jlr and  \\nit\\'s been the main state of Jaguar at Land Rover performance cars for what seems like forever debuted  \\nin the XK of 1996 and in a marriage made in heaven the Eaton supercharger free to SBR models like  \\nours sl ots perfectly between the 90 degree V like a cricket ball caught by two cup tans in the f -based  \\nSBR it makes 542 brake horsepower with 516 pound foot spread from 3500 to 5000 RPM Jaguar of  \\ncourse will have plans to give this engine a send -off and exactly what that will be remains to be seen  \\nbut we do know  that this will be the last series  production  Jaguar  Land  Rover  model  to be fitted  with the \\nAJ V8 I think there\\'s a tendency with this engine because it\\'s been around for so long to kind of dismiss  \\nit as ol d ha old Tech but I really like this engine I think it\\'s fantastic I don\\'t just think it\\'s one of the great  \\nengines of our time I think it\\'s one of the greatest engines of all time starts up it\\'s really kind of raucous  \\ngot a load of attitude really sort of muscle car Rumble to it and then it quietens down and when you\\'re  \\naround town it\\'s got a kind of Rich indulgent really kind of flexible feel to it that really suits a luxurious  \\nSUV now Pig talk doesn\\'t come in till 3500 RPM which sounds pretty high these days but because this  \\nengine is supercharged that is just instant response and you just feel like this car is always eager  \\nalways ready to go and it just adds to the kind of effortless feel as you drive it around town the other  \\nthing is is the noise and it really brought it home to me when I was watching the new Range Rover  \\nSport SV which has gone to the BMW V8 engine and switched from this engine basically and you know  \\nit sounds  like a much  more  digital  kind of enhanced  sort of engine  and it does  sound  like a BMW  engine  \\nstuck in a Range Rover I think from what I\\'ve heard so far and it just reminded me that we are really  \\nGonna Miss This engine when it\\'s gone or I certainly am but then you can switch it into Dynamic mode  \\non this dial here dials up all the exhaust noise gives you more throttle response and also things like  \\nsteering weight and so on and I pull it back this lever here into into manual mode to get control of the  \\ngear shift and it suddenly snaps alive and starts to feel like a much more ki nd of aggressive more  \\ninvolving sort of car and it sends 90 of the torque to the back by the way so those gear shifts that were  \\nrefined before and really starting to slap now but you do get that census eight gears raw quite closely  \\nstacked  and that kind of Relentless  delivery  is just the power  just keeps  on coming  so fourth  into fifth so \\neven though the power band is relatively now it\\'s not too bad but it stops revving really stops pulling at  \\nwhat seven two something like that you know it\\'s just this sense that it\\'s just coming all the time and  \\nreally kind of leaning back and and firing at the Horizon so in terms of MPG officially it\\'s 23.1 MPG and  \\nactually I\\'ve been getting pretty close to that with a mix of town runs uh Motorway runs to the airport  \\nthings like that so low 20s 21 22 maybe I was pretty happy with that given my sort of driving but then a  \\ncar reader  got in touch  Peter  Heming  he\\'s bought  one and he says he\\'s getting  28 to 31 out of his at the \\nmoment which you know he must be absolutely stroking it along but fair play that\\'s really good MPG for  \\nan engine that\\'s as exciting as this but who knows maybe you know I\\'m sure this will go out with some  \\nkind of tear -jerking send -off maybe in an f -based svr maybe some special project overall though I love  \\n\\nthis poetry and who knows maybe the h8 V8 will be a crate engine like a Chevy LS once Jack retires it  \\nit\\'s relatively light it\\'s Compact and it\\'s durable too and I wonder if you could fit one in an eyepiece now  \\nthat would be fun [Music] like a Jaguar it should well that\\'s another big question this is you know it\\'s an  \\nSUV it weighs  just over two tons so it\\'s not a sports  car or a sports  Saloon  and that\\'s  what  Jaguar  really  \\ncut its teeth on and what it forged that reputation for ride and handling Excellence but I would say a lot  \\nof that Jaguar character does bubble to the surface here and it\\'s for a lot of different reasons you know  \\nit does  ride well I think  it\\'s steering  you know  the front end grip it\\'s not you know  crazy  front end grip but \\nit\\'s got a very very strong front end for a big heavy SUV with that five liter Supercharged V8 in the nose  \\nbody control the way it leans into that corner but but kind of controls its mass and is predictable with it  \\nrather than getting in some nasty tank slapper I think that\\'s really confidence inspiring as well a couple  \\nof areas where it can fall down are in town it can feel a little bit tough in town but once you\\'re up to  \\nspeed it rides really nicely it breathes unless you\\'re on a very heavily cambered B road which you can  \\nget in the UK okay not so much here although you can see it there rocking about a little bit and that\\'s  \\nbecause this car is coils and anti -roll bars rather than say a Ran ge Rover Sport svr with air Springs  \\nwhere you know it can isolate that you can use active roll control instead of anti -roll bars that have a  \\nphysical connection so you know cambered roads in town it can feel a little bit tougher but you know  \\ngenerally the balance this car strikes with you know ride handling refinement I think it\\'s a really nice  \\nbalance so we\\'ve got 90 of the power going to the rear wheels in Dynamic mode so it\\'s all -wheel drive  \\n90 of the power and if we sweep into here you can just see how you can promote a bit of a slide you  \\ncan you know not in a silly way but just to tuck it into the corner and make it feel like it\\'s it\\'s going in a  \\ndirection you want it to but it stops short of being kind of you know a bit ludicrous and a bit wild like the  \\nf-pace or the F Type R as much as I like that car this is a car where you can dig into the power more  \\nand use it with more confidence so all in the ride the handling the luxury of this car I think it works really  \\nwell the other thing is is the steering a nd and that\\'s really good in this car I would say you know for a  \\ntwo-ton SUV that needs to be isolated and comfortable and refined it does a really good job of keying  \\nyou into the surface of letting you know what\\'s going on at ground level it\\'s nicely weighted as well you  \\nknow it\\'s not too light in Comfort is maybe a bit too light but I\\'ve got in Dynamic here it adds a bit of  \\nextra heft and it just really makes you you know feel at the core of the action and confident to Chuck  \\nwhat is a pretty big and tall car around and enjoy it as well the other thing I\\'d say that feeds into all that  \\nkind of feel as you\\'re driving it is the brake pedal so that the facelift got the enhanced brake booster I  \\nthink most of the time it works really well but there are moments where it feels over servoed a bit over  \\nresponsive  and particularly  at slower  speeds  but if I dip into it here just nice and firm reassuring  and you \\nknow overall the way this car handles the way it mixes kind of really engaging handling with comfort  \\nand luxury  I think  it works  really  well so one of the big reasons  to buy the svr if not the biggest  reason  to \\nbuy is this new pivy Pro infotainment system it\\'s a new 11.4 inch screen looks much mor e modern than  \\nthe system that went before even if it could be a bit more neatly integrated into the design so I do find it  \\nintuitive to use you\\'ve got these three tiles that have got some of your key shortcut functions like  \\nnavigation phone and media here if we\\'re going to navigation easily set your destination we go into the  \\nradio I\\'ve got it set to six music but you can easily swipe through all your other stations but touch  \\nscreens can be a bit distracting or very distracting at times so I\\'m very pleased that we\\'ve got the touch  \\ncontrol here voice control and you can you know program your navigation through that or choose to  \\nchange the radio station and if these three tiles aren\\'t what you need then you can dig a little bit deeper  \\ninto these functions down here so you can see we\\'ve got things like apple carplay we\\'ve got all surface  \\ninformation about what the car is  doing when you\\'re off -road and also  importantly Dynamic I so  \\nnormally you\\'re tweaking the cars modes here here but this Dynamic mode you can shift to your own  \\nkind of personal taste so for instance I\\'ve got everything in Dynamic except for the suspension which  \\nI\\'ve put into the Comfort mode with the  facelift and this redesign you also get these  new climate  \\ncontrols which are very much like the ones in the Range Rover Velar and what I like about these you  \\nget the digital display they look very modern and fresh again but they\\'re also they\\'re an analog dial so  \\nyou can feel them  they\\'re  nicely  knurled  so if you\\'re  in a kind of you know  you\\'re  getting  overloaded  and \\nyou\\'re on the road you can just turn down the temperature really quickly they are kind of multifunctional  \\nin that you pull them out to change the fan and you push them in again to change the cooled and  \\nheated seats which I really like as well but when I lend this car out to people it generally comes back  \\n\\nwith something like the heat cranked up or the blower going too much and they\\'ve got a bit mixed up  \\nbut personally I find this quite easy to use and the last thing you also get is this new redesigned gear  \\nshifter now it\\'s not as bad as the things in the 911 and the golf which are really fiddly little little gear  \\nknobs but it\\'s not as good as the previous p pistol grip shifter which was a little bit taller and that\\'s for  \\ntwo reasons now firstly it\\'s because I find it a little bit slow to respond so if you\\'re  taken out of park and  \\ninto drive it doesn\\'t always respond and that\\'s not a problem when you\\'re moving away from a parking  \\nspace but when you\\'re at the traffic lights it always discourages me from from taking it out of drive and  \\nput it in park and you can\\'t  knock  it over to the left to select  manual  and again  when  you\\'re  sort of on the \\nroad you want to select manual I find that really intuitive on this you have to pull it give it kind of double  \\npull back and then check on the dash that you\\'ve got it but overall I think this is a big Improvement on  \\nwhat went before so which options do I need well when this car was built it\\'s a 72 plate it costs 81 500  \\npounds  and that Jaguar  added  almost  8 000 pounds  worth  of options  and that took the final price  of this \\ncar to 89 370 pounds  but since  then Jaguar  has rejigged  the pricing  structure  so the svr now starts  from \\n85 180 pounds but you do get a lot more standard equipment and the net result is this car as specs  \\ncosts 87 940 pounds and it\\'s cheaper than it was before so it depends whether you\\'re buying your  \\nfacelift svr new or used and 21 to 72 plate cars like cars could have a less generous specification kit  \\nthat was previously optional and is now standard includes 22 inch Alloys they were previously 900  \\npounds gloss black exterior trim for everythi ng from the badging to the Bonnet vents that used to be  \\n1250 pounds the Meridian Surround Sound audio that was 420 pounds and the fixed panoramic roof  \\nthat was 1275 pounds this one\\'s fixed but there\\'s now an optional sliding roof and that\\'s currently 350  \\npounds these performances are standard now but they come with suede cloth inserts but you still have  \\nto pay 1100 pounds extra to get them in semi -aniline leather like ours head -up display is also still  \\noptional that\\'s 830 pounds I\\'ve got an extremely active  lifestyle I go base jumping a free solo any rock  \\nface I can find in the East Midlands but I also like the inflatables at Rutland Aqua Park the last time I  \\nwas there  I used  this really  useful  option  actually  it\\'s 325 pounds  at the moment  it\\'s the activity  key what  \\nit means is you can lock away your key in the glove box or even leave it at home lock your valuables  \\ninside the car and then just jump in the water you have to worry about putting the key in a changing  \\nroom or something so if you\\'ve got an active lifestyle like me you might want to consider the activity key  \\nhow does  it compare  with Rivals  well that is the big one isn\\'t it should  you buy this car versus  Rivals  but \\nwhen I first group tested the fbase SBR when it came out 2021 we had three ot her cars and I did put it  \\nin first position so we had the x6m BMW and we also had the Audi rsq8 now those were the most  \\ncomparable cars to the f -pace but they\\'re about 50 brake horsepower more powerful they\\'re a lot  \\nheavier and also there were well over a hundred thousand pounds as well the other car in that group  \\ntest was the KN Coupe  S now that was more  comparable  on price  but that made  470 brake  horsepower  \\nso it was a good bit down on the FPS svr so it was actually quite truly positioned now the f -base is  \\nabout  77 millimeters  shorter  I think  than the KN but its wheelbase  is only 21 millimeters  shorter  so when  \\nyou look in the back there\\'s actually plenty of space I\\'ve got a couple of teenage kids they\\'re fine back  \\nthere and also the boot is more spacious than the KN as well so I think all round is an all -round  \\npackage performance price practicality actually it Stacks up really well the other thing I did was I did a  \\njob with this car recently for for car magazine I went to visit a Jaguar collector who let\\'s face it had an  \\nawful lot of money and he\\'d actually dismissed a Range Rover Sport SBR not because it\\'s a bit yobby  \\nbut which I don\\'t think is yobbier than this car but because he just thought it was too much money even  \\nthey had the funds to buy it but when I let him drive this he really really liked it he thought he may well  \\nbuy it and he thought  it was good  value  in the context  at this Market  as well [Music]  so there  you have  it \\nover 6 000 highly contented miles in the Jaguar f -pace svr I like the engine like the handling the design  \\nand I like the refinement of this car I also like the fact you\\'re unlikely to see another which can\\'t be said  \\nbut it\\'s Sibley the Range Rover svr I\\'ve seen one other f -based svr and I was so surprised I actually  \\nstopped to video it nothing has gone wrong during our time with this car I still enjoy driving it very much  \\nthat all those  miles  have  turned  up a few floors  I didn\\'t  notice  on first acquaintance  but two years  since  I \\nfirst tested it against the German opposition it\\'s to take the Jaguar f -pace svr over them all [Applause]  \\n[Music] foreign [Music]  \\n\\nCar Model: Jaguar 2021 I -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nthere are Award winners and then as this car junkie was first all -electric model the ipace which is 160 - \\nthat\\'s 62 awards including managing an unprecedented travel at the World Car of the Year awards that  \\ndesign  Car of the Year  Green  Car of the Year  as well as the top spot world  Car of the Year  the first ever \\ncars to clock up three awards in one go and the first ever EB to win the overall title that\\'s really quite a  \\nlist isn\\'t it so I guess it\\'s safe to say that it\\'s probably pretty good well spoiler alert yes yes it is it is  \\nbrilliant in fact but before I tell you what\\'s so good about it don\\'t forget to subscribe to the channel then  \\nyou get a notification when the latest video from Tom Nikki and I has landed and please come and say  \\nhello to us over at electrifying calm so the jugular ipa ce an SUV that defies convention and in all the  \\nbest ways first of all does the way it looks it\\'s an SUV but not a tall one it\\'s more slinky than that it looks  \\nmodern and classy a bit like a subtle spaceship Jaguar embraced the opportunity when it came to  \\nmaking their very first electric car and produce something quite radical that somehow still manages to  \\nlook like a Jag which  takes  someone  as clever  as its designer  Ian Callum  to pull it off I mean  just look at \\nit there is so much that I love about this ca r I adore its side profile swooping arch on the top there and I  \\nlike the way the handles just pop elegantly in and out to the doors and I do think it looks great with  \\nmassive wheels the bigger the better and these are huge designer wheels aren\\'t they and at the front  \\nhere the low nose and then the way that the wheel arches just sweep a little bit gives it a real  \\npurposeful look I don\\'t even get me started on that massive vent there which again just looks fantastic  \\nthe whole thing is really modern and interesting without ever being flashy and the thing I like the most  \\nabout it is that every time I see it I think it looks even better it\\'s one of those cars that might be to night a  \\ncouple of years old now but still looks fresh and it looks really modern and it\\'s the same here on the  \\ninside just really thoughtful elegant design without too much shouting us this is definitely not  \\nin-your-face design which I like a lot I like the floating console here with the gap at the back and the  \\nhandy storage compartments they\\'re great for keeping your phone completely out of the way when  \\nyou\\'re driving and there\\'s just loads of nice little details in here and you know what people the details  \\nreally make the difference because this is where you spend all your time not looking at it from the  \\noutside the seats are very comfortable with plenty of adjustments and the seating position is nice and  \\nraised but not too high I mean  generally  in here is just a lovely  place  to be there  are two touchscreens  a \\n10-inch one here and a five inch version just underneath jankier calls it touch pro duo and it works  \\npretty well most of the time it can get a little laggy sometimes a common criticism of janky was  \\nentertainment but it\\'s not a deal -breaker then as a twelve point three inch screen right in front and that  \\ncan be set up to show  pretty  much  anything  you want  it to from sat-nav instructions  to Spotify  playlists  it \\nis a bit clunky and fiddly to navigate though and the first time I drove it it took me absolutely ages to get  \\nmy head around how the climate control was operated safe to say intuitive it isn\\'t so looks great it has a  \\nbeautiful interior but you know what the best bit is the way it drives [Music] [Applause] [Music]  \\n[Applause] [Music] now the ipace is classed as an SUV but it isn\\'t really it feels far lower than that  \\nbecause it actually is and in fact I think it\\'s a mistake to really try and class ify this car the battery is in a  \\ntraditional skateboard arrangement now that one is where the engineers load the heavy batteries in the  \\nfloor of the car between the wheels to keep the center of gravity low so it has a motor on each axle and  \\nit\\'s also got all -wheel drive and weight distribution is roughly 50/50 which is very good news for balance  \\nwhich in turn is very good news from one of my absolute favorite things about the ipace the way it goes  \\nand corners just sticks to the road beautifully this thing j ust works I\\'ve driven this car a lot and it takes  \\nme roughly oh I don\\'t know 10 seconds behind the wheel to remind me exactly why it has picked up all  \\nthose awards there\\'s only one model available the Eevee 400 but that comes in three specs s SE and  \\nHSE so that means you get just one size of battery a fairly big 90 kilowatt unit and one power output  \\njust with three different levels of luxury the other thing to say is that it is definitely not slow even by the  \\nstandards an electric car which are notoriously very quick off the mark it\\'s a car that\\'s true to Jagua  \\nsporting  DNA  it really  doesn\\'t  disappoint  using  its at 396 horsepower  and 513 pounds  of torque  to hit 62 \\nin just under 5 seconds top speed is a hundred and twenty -four miles per hour but that\\'s not really the  \\n\\npoint because it\\'s the way that the only  pace manages to pull out for a  quick overtake or accelerate  \\nonto a motorway sliprock that just really impressive it means pulling out of a Junction and getting up to  \\nspeed it\\'s just a near -instant operation and it is the kind of thing that as a driver just gives you loads of  \\nconfidence  particularly  in bad conditions  when  you throw  the all-wheel  drive  into the mix it\\'s got the kind \\nof real world punch that makes traditional sports car owners really get quite annoyed but the best bit is  \\nthat this is an Eevee that actually drives like you\\'re supposed to enjoy it like y ou\\'re supposed to love it  \\nof course most TVs do feel fast from a standstill but they can also feel just a little bit numb not with the  \\neye pace  it really  is a standout  in this price  range  at the moment  you can have  to pay way way more  for \\na portrait icon to get anywhere near this level of fun from a pure electric vehicle it\\'s not all good news  \\nthough  the claimed  range  is some  292 miles  but to be honest  we\\'ve  struggled  to get anywhere  near that \\nthat figure is the absolute best case scenario based on a car with all the lightest options available and  \\nreally good weather conditions the kind that just are optimum for a battery a loaded car has a predicted  \\nrange of 258 miles but even so if you want to stay comfortable warm or cool listen to music just kind of  \\nyou know  go about  your business  enjoying  the car and you\\'re  probably  looking  at sticking  to a couple  of \\nhundred miles without charging I mean saying that Jack Hewitt has offered a complimentary up date to  \\nthe IPAs so that upgrading cars are offer over -the-air updates and on with a tweaked program for the  \\nbattery it gives you all the other 10 miles or so of pure electric range on a full charge now that constant  \\nevolution is one of the real benefits for pure Eevee and its really good to see that jankura is getting in  \\non the over -the-air action in fact there are loads of neat but subtle touches you can precondition the  \\nbattery and heat or cool the cabin when it\\'s charging before you get in by using the app on the  \\nsmartphone  and that happens  without  depleting  any of the charge  it switches  off the air vents  if it knows  \\nit there\\'s nobody sitting in the seat to appreciate them and it can be programmed to automatically  \\nchange the car settings depending on which key is being used and this is all very good stuff so what  \\nabout its rivals will you be Duff not to look Tesla\\'s way the model 3 is a little smaller less expensive the  \\nModel S is a bit bigger they both though do a starling job you should also check out our videos of the  \\nAudi e -tron and Mercedes EQ see if you want something more traditionally SUV shaped I guess a bit  \\nmore traditional all around really the eye pace is a serious bit of kit you know I go so far as to say that  \\nthis is the best car that Jaguar make it looks fantastic it\\'s forward -thinking it\\'s brilliant to drive yes it  \\nwould be good if the range wasn\\'t quite so optimistic and that infotainment system could probably do  \\nwith an upgrade but really it\\'s well worthy of all those awards it\\'s won every 62 of them [Music] you  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2021 I -Pace  \\nReview:  \\n[Applause] [Music] this is the 2021 jaguar eye pace and jaguar has done so many things right with this  \\nall-electric suv it\\'s won so many awards especially for its design but can we say the same about the  \\ntech inside especially since they haven\\'t updated one of the parts that people didn\\'t like before i tell you  \\nwhat that is make sure you subscribe to electrifying.com for more videos like this and every time we  \\nupload a new video so you get notified so the i -pace comes with a lot of the features we\\'ve come t o \\nexpect from electric cars these days for example you can remote lock it using a phone app you can  \\nprecondition the car so for example when it\\'s winter you can pre -heat the car before you get in and you  \\ncan even set it to be cool for summer times but talking about apps though when you go for the app  \\nstore there\\'s so many different apps available from jaguar that sometimes it can be confusing figuring  \\nout which one you actually need to download having said that though when you set up a new profile on  \\nhere i t actually tells you gives you a link to download the latest and most up -to-date application for your  \\nsmartphone  it\\'s available  on ios and android  as well so you\\'re  in luck if you have  either  of those  devices  \\nthe ipace  has been  updated  with the latest  pv pro infotainment  system  so with the instrument  cluster  for \\nthe driver  you have  a 12.3 inch display  which  is nice and big you can see everything  visibly  and you can \\neven edit the layout so you can change what you actually see on there what\\'s important to you one  \\nthing i wish they did differently here though is something that audi does very well so for example to  \\n\\nchange the view to change the view layout so you have to go into settings on there and scroll through  \\nand eventually you update the settings and the layout but for me in an audi at the touch of a button you  \\ncan change the view to suit whether you\\'re trying to be eco -friendly or you\\'re trying to put your foot  \\ndown so you can see all the speed and the lighting changes and everything on here though is where  \\neverything else happens so on the climate control area you have a five inch display which is also touch  \\nscreen and is a combination of a very responsive dial here as well but the first thing you notice though  \\nis when you\\'re trying to use this for the first time it can get a little bit confusing can get a little bit tricky  \\nbut once you figure it out it\\'s very straightforward you have a push to pull system with this rotary dial  \\nsystem so for example you pull to change the temperature you push it down to change the fan and you  \\nknow the intensity of the fan in the car and then the touchscreen area is where you co ntrol your climate  \\nentirely so for example you can turn it on and you can put smart climate on as well but what i really like  \\nthough are two things you have purifying which means you can purify the air that comes inside the car  \\nor inside the car already you also have to ionize in setting as well so come summer for me for example  \\nwhen there\\'s pollen everywhere it means that gets filtered out before it gets in the car and i\\'m not  \\naffected i\\'m not going to be sneezing throughout my journey so it\\'s a lot more c omfortable for myself  \\nand the passengers in the car as well also below the climate control area you have a wireless charging  \\nmat which is which comes as an option by the way is not standard in the eye pace but one thing i find  \\nabout that space is trying to get your phone to actually sit in there comfortably depending on which size  \\nphone  you have  so you either  fit it from this side it\\'s a little gap on the floating  console  here and you you \\nget your phone in there and it starts charging and then it gets a bit awkward trying to get the phone out  \\nat the same time so i\\'m not sure what jaguar we\\'re thinking when it comes to the design of where that  \\nwireless  charging  mac goes  behind  here we have  a two usb ports  there  so there\\'s  a usbc  port and a full \\nusb as well which i quite like i like this that\\'s still stuck to the full usb -a as well because some of us still  \\nuse uh the good old usb -a charging cables and talking about that you can use that to con nect to your  \\niphone as well or your android device and you have apple carplay or android auto available there as  \\nwell onto the main infotainment system you have different profiles available so you can add multiple  \\npeople to use the car things like vehicle settings climate control settings can be assigned to them so in  \\nmy settings my seat settings is assigned to me every time i get inside of the car elsewhere we have  \\nthings like camera so we have a 360 degree camera in the car zone we can view our surroundin gs and  \\nit also helps  with parking  the car as well or when  traveling  at low speeds  it also activates  sometimes  but \\nmaybe if you roll back a little bit it will activate just to allow you to see your surroundings which is good  \\nfor safety purposes the icons are nicely laid out as well the very simple and minimalist i love the design  \\nof it you can even edit this so that you can arrange it to your preference as well so if we swipe across  \\nyou can see your settings options here so you can do things like change screen brightness the home  \\nlayout so at the moment i\\'ve got icons as my own layout you can also have different tiles a s well in  \\nterms of home layout but if we go further into home screen here we then have more option to do to edit  \\nthose things so here again you got app tiles or app icons and you can edit that layout itself so if you  \\nhave tiles for example at the moment we have ev driving style uh energy impact navigation phone and  \\nmedia uh so there\\'s right at the top there you can see where they are but what we can do is then drag  \\nanother  one like so so we can stick ev there  we can have  driving  style energy  impact  see nice and easy  \\nto use just like you would on your smartphone once you\\'ve configured your tiles you can then go back  \\nto the home screen and see the layout so then you can swipe across when it does actually work so this  \\ntakes me onto the next bit which is that one thing i mentioned at the start that they still haven\\'t really  \\nimproved on jaguar said this is meant to be intuitive like you would on your smartphone so things like  \\nswiping  across  should  be nice and fluid but sometimes  it\\'s just a bit laggy  nothing\\'s  happening  nothing\\'s  \\nhappening and then bam it happens imagine when you\\'re driving and you\\'re trying to swipe across to  \\nquickly select something that can be really annoying and that can be distracting when you\\'re trying to  \\nkeep your focus on the road are there many options that you have there to do with the electricity and  \\nyou know energy consumption you have the ev menu which is very important so if we tap that you can  \\nsee your charging information and your preferred charging period as well so at the moment it tells me  \\ni\\'ve got 48 battery left and my predicted range as well if we go into energy that then tells me my energy  \\nconsumption as well which can be useful for you to be able to improve your driving style and all that  \\nstuff in here we have vehicle preconditioning as well so if we select that you can set things like when  \\n\\nyou depart  and when  you get back  home  as well so you can get the car warmed  up you can preheat  the \\nbattery and all that stuff next we have eco data so inside ecodata it gives you more detail about your  \\ndrive style and range impact and all that stuff i really like this i\\'m i\\'m a nerd when it comes to data so  \\nwhen it comes to this you can see your drive star you can see duration of when i\\'ve been driving range  \\nimpacts in terms of things in the inside the car like the ac the the screen heating and the steering  wheel  \\nheating and seat eating as well so if i put those things on it will tell me how they impact the range i\\'ve  \\ngot left in the car if you\\'re going to eco tips it then gives you some tips on how to save range and what  \\nyou can do to you know to add a bit more range to your journey which is pretty cool and then if you go  \\ninto history you can see how well you\\'ve done over time again more data for you to improve your drive  \\nstyle and not only save the environment but also save on when it comes to range that yo u\\'ve got left on  \\nthe car next we have voice so the same way you can control different things in the car using the rotary  \\ndials and the touch screen and stuff you can also use your voice as well inside voice you have your  \\nclimate commands phone commands and if you have your apple device connected for example you  \\ncan use it to control siri for example which is pretty neat to have inside of the car right you\\'ve also got  \\nsettings in there which allows you to set a wake up word so the same way you use your google  \\nassistant  at home  or amazon  alexa  devices  you can also do that here so we can say something  like hey \\njaguar when he works here jaguar hey jaguar go  to buckingham palace sorry i\\'m a stat you can  also \\nsay help for further assistance go to buckingham palace choose a line number two [Music] voila so  \\nthere you have it once you tell it where you want to go it sets the destination and then we can go from  \\nthere speaking of maps with the pv pro uh new pvp pro infotainment system what you also get with the  \\nmap is it\\'s very ev friendly  so it sets the destination  it navigates  you with ev charging  stations  in mind  so \\nthe best ones to make sure that you charge very quickly and also make sure that you get there safely  \\nand back safely as well without worrying about the range in the car although you have an ev -friendly  \\nmaps there one thing i do find those i still find myself connect to my phone to use google maps and the  \\nreason why that is is for basic traffic information i find google maps a lot more up -to-date for example  \\nthe other  day when  i was driving  there  was a roadblock  this app navigation  here in the car did not find a \\nway to reroute me to find a different way alternative route so i kept going around in circles until i got my  \\nphone connected again and google maps was able to reroute me and find me a better route to get  \\nhome next we have media so this is where the magic happens and i keep myself entertained in the car  \\nso you can connect up to two devices at the same time using bluetooth in the car or if you want to use  \\napple  car play when  you don\\'t  want  to do dab radio  fm radio  etc you can simply  connect  using  your own \\nusb cable connect it to the car and you get access to apple carplay so your interface moves over to the  \\nbig screen and then you can control things like your music google maps and so on so you can see they  \\nget access to your calendar your schedule for the day and this is where i use my google maps because  \\nit\\'s just a lot more easier for me to do so another smart thing about the navigation in the car is being  \\nable to actually find parking spaces very easily as well so the sat nav can actually find th e nearest  \\nparking stations and where you can park that\\'s optimal to your destination and also when it comes to  \\npaying for parking you can actually do that in the car without leaving the car there\\'s a park and pay  \\nmenu so you just have to link your profile to your parking provider for example there\\'s a ring going here  \\nand using that you can pay for parking right in the car without having to leave the car connectivity and  \\nentertainment and all that though it\\'s not just geared towards the driver it\\'s also gear ed towards the  \\npassengers in the car as well for example you get 4g wi -fi hotspots so we can connect up to eight  \\ndevices to the car and access the internet so if you have passengers in the backseat working away on  \\nthe laptop they can connect on the go and actually access the internet as well on the back you also get  \\ntwo usbc  ports  so if they want  to connect  their phones  or and charge  their devices  they can also do that \\nin the car one thing that doesn\\'t get mentioned a lot quite often when it comes to cars i s artificial  \\nintelligence so jaguar uses ai in the i -pace to basically calculate the most accurate range in the car  \\nbased on key factors like climate the temperature your drive style the road conditions and using those  \\nsettings as well they can also automate the mundane tasks for example you can even automatically  \\nadjust the seat settings to your preference based on those key factors as well which i find really  \\namazing it just means the car is thinking of you and based on your journeys it learns over time t he car  \\nbecomes a bit a bit like an extension of you you get more comfortable when you\\'re driving and that\\'s  \\namazing last but not least is also software over -the-air updates what that means is basically wirelessly  \\n\\njaguar can send updates to the ipace so it just saves you the trip to the local dealership so you don\\'t  \\nhave  to keep  going  back  for updates  everything  just gets updated  again  taking  us into the future  [Music]  \\nself-driving options are quite limited in the i -pace although you get plenty of safety options like lane  \\nkeep assist you also get things like rear traffic alerts and emergency braking even front collision  \\nwarning as well you get emergency braking in general which are quite great for keeping yourself safe  \\nand secure on the road you also get uh fatigue alerts as well so if the driver is tired any senses that  \\nyou\\'re driving in a very tired manner it sort of alerts you lets you know that you need to wake up and  \\nkeep  your eyes  on the road and hands  on the steering  whilst  driving  though  what  i also love is that head  \\nmirror that digital head mirror so using the hd camera on the back uh that\\'s integrated on the fin of the  \\nantenna on the back and that ultra wide angle lens just gives you a clear vision of what\\'s going on  \\nbehind the car and what\\'s great about that though is the fact that everyone that\\'s sat in the back if  \\nthey\\'re tall or short or whatever it means they won\\'t be blocking your vision or peripherals for t he \\nparents out there though who likes to keep an eye on the kids at the back or if you have a pet and you  \\nwant  to keep  an eye on them  at the back  you won\\'t  be able to do that with a digital  camera  but what  you \\ncan do though is switch it off i\\'ll flick at the toggle and that way you can just quickly see what\\'s going on  \\nand it\\'s back to just your regular mirror one thing i do find though is once you switch it off the switch  \\nbetween going from digital to manual or your regular mode goes a bit darker which means your vision  \\nhave to quickly adjust to what\\'s going on uh behind you when it comes to the music in the car and  \\nsound quality it sounds amazing too you have meridian audio installed in the car already which sou nds \\ngreat you got the woofer doing all the bass and the twitter\\'s helping with the mids as well and voice  \\nclarity as well so if you\\'re listening to a podcast in the car you\\'ll be able to hear the voice clearly with no  \\nissues at all but there are a few things i would change though in terms of how responsive the display  \\nthe infotainment system is for example so when you\\'re swiping across sometimes it freezes it lags and  \\nsometimes as well what you get is with the digital head mirror as much as i love it the sw itch between  \\nbright light situation and when it goes darker it doesn\\'t do it instantaneously so sometimes it\\'s a bit  \\njarring to the eyes but apart from that i think overall jagger\\'s done a good job here so there you have it  \\nthat\\'s the gadgets boy tech rundown of the new jaguar i

guys and welcome to petrol ped now recently jaguar announced that from 2025 they will cease  \\nproduction of all petrol and diesel vehicles and only make electric cars now behind me is the new 2021  \\njaguar i -pace the only electric car they currently make it best be good [Music] now this is actually the  \\nsecond time i\\'ve had an eye pace on the channel i drove on a couple of years ago not long after they  \\nlaunched and it impressed me a great deal i don\\'t think it\\'s a massive secret that i\\'ve got a bit of a soft  \\nspot for the i -pace for me i think it\\'s i think it\\'s one of the best -looking cars that jaguar make and it\\'s  \\ncertainly right up there in terms of one of the best -looking evs that you can buy and i kn ow looks are  \\nvery subjective but this ticks a lot of boxes for me i think the front of the car is so sleek i\\'ve always liked  \\nthe headlamp design and interestingly if you look at the new f -type i think a lot of i -pace has gone into  \\nf-type but i\\'ve always loved the way that the air is sculpted at the front you\\'ve got this intake here that  \\ncomes through and then out here to if you like airflow management around the front of the car to help  \\nreduce  its drag coefficient  and so on now this is the new demonstrator  for my good  friends  at harwood\\'s  \\njaguar chichester and they emailed me a couple of weeks ago and said look head we\\'ve got the new  \\ni-pace in we think you\\'ll like it it\\'s got some really interesting updates especially to do with the satnav  \\nand mmi which i\\'ll get onto very shortly but look at it from a spec point of view this dark blue color with  \\nthe black  wheels  just looks  beautiful  the interior  is very light and very airy not sure how much  i could  live \\n\\nwith those white seats but they do look really nice and then you walk down the side of the car and it\\'s  \\njust got lovely lines and i get to the back of the car the back\\'s lovely so where do i start with the back  \\nwell i\\'m going to start where the airwood and that\\'s through this kind of roof spoiler here sets the top of  \\nthe car off beautifully privacy glass i\\'m always a big fan of privacy glass but the back of the car the way  \\nthis car\\'s been spec with the slight tint in the rear lights the blacked out badge wo rk i love the diffuser  \\nsection there it just looks brilliant from the back for me really really like it a great deal and then in terms  \\nof boot space do you know what it\\'s not too bad obviously i\\'ve got the obligatory charge cable just lying  \\nthere but there is some underfloor storage not a great deal i\\'d put the charge cable in there if this were  \\nmy car obviously but it\\'s plenty big enough especially for a couple of dogs it\\'s quite tempting as a  \\nproposition this car i have to say so yeah you would think that  with that sloping roof line the boot space  \\nmight be compromised a little bit but it\\'s not see like in the back rear passenger love those handles not  \\nbad um i\\'ve got a fair amount of leg room as i always say in these videos that seat is set for me as a  \\ndriver i have long legs and i\\'ve got a reasonable amount of leg room i don\\'t know how i would classify  \\nthis car whether it\\'s a kind of compact suv size it\\'s it\\'s not quite like that but it is very nice in here now  \\nthis car has been spec with this full glass r oof which just gives so much light in here but it also gives a  \\nlittle bit extra headroom and i\\'ve got plenty of headroom i\\'ve got some little lighting controls up here  \\nthere is a rear parcel shelf there for the rear i don\\'t think you\\'ll get much on there and you\\'ve got heated  \\nseats in the back of this particular hse trim spec i\\'ve got a couple of charge ports and a 12 volt socket  \\nit\\'s nice guessing this is some nice little uh yeah i could i could quite easily sit in here for a long journey  \\nit\\'s really nice let\\'s have a sit where the action happens at the front oh no bad news child locks bump  \\nfinally managed to get myself out the back of the car note to self check that the child locks aren\\'t on  \\nnext time pet but anyway welcome to the interior the new 2021 jaguar i -pace let me just fire the car up  \\num to show you the displays first things first i\\'m a big fan of the way this car is laid out on the inside the  \\nchoice of materials is excellent this is the hse spec so it\\'s their highest level of spec and you can tell  it\\'s \\na premium  premium  product  in here but there  are things  that have  been  done  in this car that i just really  \\nlike that are just a bit different from other cars that i\\'ve driven for example you\\'ve got this big wide  \\nscreen here with all of your different um sat nav audio and other vehicle controls i love the fact it\\'s got a  \\nwhite backlight and the font choice and just the really nice it\\'s it\\'s really very very easy to use there\\'s a  \\nlot of touch  screen  in here but then most  evs have  that and there\\'s  lots of information  that you can delve  \\ninto in this car you could  spend  a lot of time just playing  with all the differe nt controls  a couple  of things  i \\ndo like there\\'s an eco data screen so this car will help you try and improve your driving style and what\\'s  \\nreally nice is the range prediction will change dependent upon the things that you\\'re using in the car so  \\nfor example this car\\'s got heated searing wheel or heated seats you put those on it\\'s going to hamper  \\nthe rain slightly and that will be reflected on here it even gives you eco tips on how to drive better and  \\nyou can look at the history of how you\\'re doing so i i know i think there\\'s a worry sometimes with evs  \\nthat people you buy one and you just suddenly become obsessed with driving economically and tr ying \\nto eke out as much range as possible and maybe that\\'s the case but this car will certainly help you do  \\nthat in terms of the the actual charging if we just have a look at that the the maximum range of this car  \\non a full charge is about 220 miles and now clearly that will depend on a few things driving style  \\ntemperature the things that you\\'re using in the car and for me that\\'s close but not quite close enough i  \\nreally need this car to be having maybe 50 to 75 miles more than that for it to be a propositi on that we  \\nwould buy now this video is not going to be about charging infrastructure and so on but the vast  \\nmajority  of owners  are going  to charge  at home  wake  up in the morning  full battery  charge  do their daily \\ncommute their daily drive come back home plug it in again and never ever visit public charging  \\ninfrastructure and for most of our journeys that would be the case however um we have a house in  \\ncornwall and we\\'d like to drive down there it\\'s about 230 miles and i would like to be able to do that  \\nwithout having to stop and therefore this car can\\'t quite do that which is very frustrating because as an  \\nelectric vehicle when we get out on the road it ticks many many of my boxes and i\\'m going to say  \\nsomething that will definitely get the comments section going as a non -tesla ev this is number one on  \\nmy shopping  list so the big challenge  with any non-tesla  ev as you are at the mercy  of a public  charging  \\ninfrastructure in the uk that currently from my perspective is not up to the job um i know things are  \\nimproving and i know they\\'re bound to improve over the over the coming years but at the moment it\\'s  \\njust not good  enough  now you can also do some  things  to extend  range  like pre-conditioning  the battery  \\n\\nwell the car\\'s still plugged in especially in cold weather so there are some really nice screens on here  \\num for us to see now at the moment i\\'m running i think it said they\\'re 44 of battery and i\\'ve got um a  \\npredicted range now of 96 miles and i have actually done a about 100 or so miles in the car this  \\nmorning i drove to the new forest and back uh to do something off camera and the other thing about  \\nthis car the sat nav has some really nice features that enable you to search for the nearest charge  \\nstation but it really nicely it doesn\\'t just say where it is but it tells you what speed of charger it is um and  \\nthere\\'s also a link there where you can look for food stops and those types of things so the integration  \\nof the charge network to the sat nav seems to be much better in this new updated jaguar i -pace than in  \\nsome of the other manufacturers evs have had recently this secondary touch screen here is all to do  \\nwith your climate controls your gear selector are just four buttons down here drive neutral reverse  and \\npark and then you\\'ve got a range of buttons here to do with the different drive modes but we need to  \\nlook at those when we get out and about driving but all in all a really nice premium place to be it\\'s a  \\nsuper interior this panoramic glass roof is a must for me it just makes the car feel so airy but it has a  \\nfairly heavy tint on it as well so you\\'re not going to get too hot if you live in a sunny climate it\\'s lovely in  \\nhere now i have  as i said already  been  driving  this quite  a bit so there\\'s  plenty  to talk about  once  we get \\non the road so let\\'s get some cameras set up and go for a drive simple place to start this road test part  \\nof the review it\\'s a lovely car to drive this the seating position and just general driving controls layout is  \\nabsolutely first class i love the steering wheel it\\'s got a nice feel to i t um it\\'s very jaguar in here but it\\'s  \\njaguar elevated to kind of more modern feel with all of these lovely instruments and touch screen  \\ndisplays the performance of the car is nippy and quick and all the instant talk and all the things you  \\nwould expect from any ev really and it impresses very quickly when you get behind the wheel as i\\'ve  \\nmentioned already i think the thing that lets the car down is range but that\\'s only because of a very  \\nspecific requirement i have for many people that probably wouldn\\'t be a massive problem but if you  \\nwant to do a longer journey then i still think evs need to be looking at the 300 miles and above range  \\nand actually if i look in the comments of many of my videos people really want 400 plus miles oh hello  \\nwhat\\'s that nice maserati um i i just don\\'t think that i can see that coming anytime soon unless there\\'s a  \\nmassive increase in battery technology i think the kind of weight efficiency performance thing is that  \\nthree 350 miles top end and really at the moment it\\'s only really t esla that are that are hitting that mark  \\na lot of the other traditional car manufacturers are struggling to get anywhere near them and i think if  \\nthis car would do 300 miles man a live jack you would sell a lot of them but i just want to address this  \\num this aim or or change  of direction  for jaguar  that they announced  very recently  and that is from 2025  \\nthey\\'re only going to do electric cars and i honestly think that\\'s a massive massive challenge for them  \\nas a company because the i -pace at the moment is the only full ev they have what happens to x e x j  \\nf-type f -pace e -pace what happens to all of those and i\\'m sure they\\'ve got plans that we haven\\'t yet  \\nseen but this is a base model as a as a kind of as a place to move on from going down that fully v root  \\nis a very very good place to start i honestly think it\\'s one of the best evs that you can buy and if we just  \\nput to one side charging infrastructure and tesla as an ownership experience they have the charging  \\ninfrastructure utterly nailed and that is why as an as a potential ev buyer model y for me is such  a an \\ninteresting proposition it has the range 300 miles or so and it has the infrastructure and that\\'s why this  \\ncar for me would would be a challenge however i sit in this car and i\\'m going to upset the tesla rt here  \\nbut this is this is on another level to any tesla i\\'ve ever sat in the build quality the the feel of quality in  \\nhere is just it\\'s just a completely different ball game and i think when you buy a tesla you almost  \\nappreciate or or or if you like um understand that the quality of the car might no t be as good as you  \\nwould like but the quality of the overall living with experience is far far better and that\\'s a shame  \\nbecause  i really  want  to buy one of these  i-paces  i really  really  like it [Music]  now i\\'ve already  mentioned  \\nearlier today i did about a hundred kind of dual carriageway miles in this car and it is super impressive  \\nyou just stick on the adaptive cruise control and it munches the miles it\\'s very smooth very quiet it\\'s a  \\nreally relaxing place to be and i get that vibe in most electric cars  to be honest once they cruise on the  \\nmotorway they\\'re lovely mile munchers until you have to charge them up of course but this i think this  \\ncar has something else that i need to tap into so i\\'m going to basically go down into this drive select  \\nprogram and i\\'m going to go into dynamic mode and that should give me a bit more throttle response  \\nand a little bit more zip and have a feeling it\\'s going to be quite a lot of zip four -wheel drive platform  \\nplenty  of go instant  talk oh yes this is why i love electric  cars because  they\\'re  just they\\'re  pulling  you get \\n\\nout of the corners is fantastic this car has quite a nice poise and a nice balance i guess aided by its  \\nweight  although  much  of that weight  is quite  low down  so the center  of gravity  is quite  low when  you get \\nthe opportunity to give your favorite b -road a bit of a blast in this car it\\'s gonna put a big smile on your  \\nface i often bring cars down this little stretch of road because it\\'s a lovely test of different types of  \\ncorners sharper tighter slow speed ones some more open flowing corners the road surface isn\\'t great  \\nwhich  is always  a good  test of a car\\'s  stability  and the view is pretty  good  as well turning\\'s  quite  nice the \\nnoise is making well it doesn\\'t have an augmented noise like some cars nowadays although it does  \\nmake a mild noise when it\\'s reversing i guess just to let passersby know that there\\'s an electric c ar \\nbacking up but it\\'s got poke it\\'s it really has it doesn\\'t have the drama and engagement of a internal  \\ncombustion engine obviously but you get that instant torque you get that powerful engine that  \\nfour-wheel drive oh hero come on son get up that hill but it would be rude of me not to try and take it up  \\nthe petropet hill climb although for regular viewers to the channel you will notice something because  \\nthis week  this road  has actually  been closed  uh because  they\\'ve been  doing some  forestry they\\'ve  \\nbeen removing all of the ash trees that have had ash dieback and it looks like a moonscape now it\\'s  \\ntotally changed the petrol bed hill climb look it\\'s so open now but it\\'s yeah it\\'s got load there\\'s loads of \\nmud on the road so i\\'m gonna be a little bit careful and and stuff but look it\\'s totally changed my favorite  \\nhill it\\'s all open  now you can see everything  but yeah  this car on a bit of b road when  you want  to have  a \\nbit of a blast and a bit of a zip it\\'s really really impressive so what are my final thoughts and final  \\nimpressions on the jaguar i -pace well i knew i\\'d like it because i liked it the first time i drove it uh for me  \\nit has it\\'s a very very good package um we haven\\'t talked money yet by the way i think the car and  \\nsaturn\\'s in the kind of 65 to 68 000 quid marks something along that range so they\\'re not cheap cars by  \\nany means but they\\'re certainly a lot cheaper than some of the evs i\\'ve driven recently the e quipment  \\nlevel in this hse spec is very very high it\\'s a beautiful place to sit wonderful selection of materials i think  \\nthe interior looks fantastic i love this kind of floating console here and there\\'s a wireless charge map  \\nbehind so the cockpit layout the ergonomics the design on the inside the aesthetics on the outside  \\neverything ticks my box the frustration for me is the range just isn\\'t quite there for me and i know plenty  \\nof people it will be enough a couple hundred miles is enough for almost every j ourney profile but if  \\nyou\\'ve  got somewhere  that you need  to go for me it\\'s 230 miles  and i want  to go there  without  having  to \\nstop at a charge point and that\\'s more to do with mrs petroped\\'s lack of patience than mine if it wasn\\'t  \\nfor that if this car did 300 miles i\\'d buy one tomorrow for me this is the best non -tesla ev that you can  \\nbuy and that\\'s not to do with the tesla car it\\'s to do with our overall ownership experience so i think for  \\njaguar going long -term going down the pure ev route from 2025 there is promise because the ev that  \\nthey have is a really really good one however the things that they need to sort out they need to get  \\nmore range now that\\'s either by this has got a big battery pack in it anyway so it\\'s got to be to do with  \\nefficiency and then they need to think about how they\\'re going to translate their ev drivetrain into their  \\nexisting  lineup  of cars what  are they going  to do with f-type what  are they going  to do with xe and xj and \\nxf are they going to replace them with something else all of these things will find out i guess um but it\\'s  \\na bold move and i know it\\'s what all the manufacturers are going to have to d o from 2030 onwards in  \\nthe uk they\\'ve banned uh you know anything other than evs and hybrids from 2030 and in a way i  \\nunderstand that and it\\'s exciting times in a way i also find it incredibly sad that jaguar won\\'t be making  \\nthe f-type anymore  i mean  come  on seriously  or certainly  not an f-type with a v8 engine  in it anyway  but \\nif it\\'s going to be like this little i -pace then that\\'s good it\\'s a good car really good car now all we need to  \\ndo is get the government to sort out the charging infrastructure and let\\'s not even go to the point of how  \\nmuch it costs to charge in public maybe i need to do a separate video on that because at the moment  \\nit\\'s pretty expensive but at the moment the government are getting lots of fuel duty from petrol and  \\ndiesel sales so when everybody starts to use electric where\\'s that extra taxation going to c ome from  \\nhold on a minute let me think uh oh yeah electricity so there\\'ll be a higher tax put on electric so it\\'ll be  \\neven more expensive to charge so either way going forward motoring in this country is going to cost us  \\nmore but as far as the i -pace is concerned it\\'s a massive tick in the box for me i love it anyway massive  \\nthank  you to dan and all the team  at harwood\\'s  jaguar  chichester  um it\\'s great  when  when  uh when  i get \\nsomeone proactively reach out to me and offer me a car uh and it\\'s been a real ple asure driving this  \\none i hope you enjoyed it i\\'d love to know what you guys think of the new ipace and if you\\'ve enjoyed  \\nthis video give me a thumbs up comments below always welcome if you haven\\'t done [Music] my  \\n\\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2021 I -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nrefreshing welcome back to car chat tv guys my name is oliver and in today\\'s episode i\\'m going to  \\nanswer the question that someone asked me they\\'ve asked me what is the best all -electric vehicle suv  \\nmoney can buy right now now on our channel you may have seen we\\'ve reviewed the utron 55 the  \\nskoda  enyak  the mustang  mark  e the list goes  on but today  i\\'m going  to tell you what  the best is are you \\nready sitting right in front of me i\\'m going to show you come on let\\'s have a look it\\'s the jaguar i -pace  \\n[Music]  ev400  let\\'s go for a walk around  first because  the styling  of this car is a little bit outlandish  isn\\'t it \\nit doesn\\'t really look like another jaguar that they produce and i like that it\\'s very differ ent unique we\\'ve  \\ngot this gorgeous back we\\'re going to come to the back in a moment but this is the got a black exterior  \\npack on it so you\\'ve got black castle around the window trim it\\'s around 410 pounds it looks good the  \\nonly thing i\\'d probably do is i\\'ll get the black wheels on there as well come to the front we\\'ve got this  \\nshort  stubby  nose  now the grill brilliant  a lot of electric  vehicles  still have  problems  with the grill because  \\nyou don\\'t  want  an electric  vehicle  to look like an electric  vehicle  you want  it to look like a normal  car and \\nthey have done such a great design job here because not only does this grill look great it flows up you  \\nget this kind of conveyor belt kind of style as it curves up through the car the air blows all the way  \\nthrough this vent which looks great may i add up the car down the back and through this spoiler now  \\nthe back we see here hasn\\'t got a rear windscreen wiper because the air just comes down through the  \\nspoiler and pushes off all the water let\\'s jump into the boot space because you might be thinking oh the  \\nstyling of the car might make it not that practical but you\\'d be wrong because you\\'ve got 577 litres of  \\nboot space back here more than enough to put loads of stuff in now put them seats back 1453 litres  \\ncables are out at the moment but look they\\'ve even designed a little cubby a little tunnel here for you to  \\nput your cables we\\'ve just been lazy and not put them back but i love that not all manufacturers have a  \\nplace for the cables we\\'ve seen that before so it\\'s a great design down quick have a look at this you \\nmight be saying oh the sloping sport back design might restrict the space in the rear seats well look i\\'m  \\nin i\\'m 511 and this is the hse trim so i\\'ve got a gorgeous  pano  roof to look up you know  what  headspace  \\nis good i\\'ve got room to move knee space is great as well so not much to worry about is there now i\\'m  \\ngoing to jump into the front into the driver\\'s seat and take this car out and tell you what it\\'s really all  \\nabout [Music] so i\\'m in the eye pace now and it is pouring down with rain so it\\'s pretty  good too to test  \\nwhat  this is like in the pouring  rain so i\\'m going  to give you some  statistics  first now it\\'s an ev400  so that \\nmeans 400 fires are stark so 396 brake horsepower is what you get 696 newton meters of torque not to  \\n60 in 4.5 seconds yes i know that is exciting and we will test that in a moment it\\'s all -wheel drive you\\'ve  \\ngot a 90 kilowatt battery pack with a range of miles can you get that real world probably not so you\\'ve  \\ngot motors on the front and the back makes it all wheel drive now the only thing that\\'s probably quicker  \\nthan naught to 64.5 seconds you\\'re looking at tesla\\'s model s model three now the e -tron s act ually can  \\ndo 4.3 which is a couple attempts off this but it\\'s a heavier car we have the e -tron 55 and it weighs 2  \\n500 kilograms now this is a lighter car still over two tons at 2208 kilograms so it\\'s a little bit more agile  \\nit\\'s a little bit nippier but i\\'m going to tell you three reasons why this is the best all -electric suv okay  \\nnumber one we spoke about the naught 60 4.5 seconds i\\'ve put it into dynamic mode what does 4.5  \\nseconds feel like this whoa you can feel that my head and there we have it oh my go sh and when you  \\nput it in dynamic road everything goes red so you\\'ve got four modes you\\'ve got dynamic mode and the  \\nsteering\\'s great it\\'s really well balanced nice and stiff i can feel the car through the road i love that and  \\nthen the other modes will go for him now so you\\'ve got comfort steering lightens up a bit and the  \\nacceleration  on the pedal  isn\\'t as sensitive  and then you\\'ve  got you know  the eco mode  and the rain ice \\nand snow but i love that this has got another element added to it the dynamic mode i s brilliant now we  \\nhave the e35 and that was really comfortable and it was a big car on the road this does not feel like an  \\nsuv it\\'s very saloon -esque the way you\\'re sitting but that raw power that\\'s something that i have not felt  \\napart from in the tesla and that\\'s why the performance that not 60 is at number one so number two has  \\n\\nto be with the new 2022 upgrades to the i -pace you\\'ve got alexa now integrated and you can see it  \\ndown here on the infotainment 10 inch infotainment there and that\\'s fantastic yeah voice commands  \\nthey\\'ve been around for a while but any proper effective ones probably not and the fact we all have  \\nalexa\\'s  at home  you can be in your living  room  room  saying  oh alexa  what  range  do i have  left in my car \\nit will tell you alexa did i lock my eye pace it will tell you and switch that round you can be in your eye  \\npace driving home going alexa set my lounge to 22.5 degrees because that\\'s how i like it alexa turn my  \\nliving room light on because that\\'s how i like it that integration of alexa that jaguar have done in their  \\ninfotainment in their pv pro system is a touch of class and i\\'m a techie guy i really like it and that\\'s why  \\ni\\'ve included it now in this jaguar eye pace it is so well balanced you\\'ve got 50 50 weight distribution  \\nfrom front to rear and it\\'s so much fun when i was driving the econ 55 now i\\'m talking about that car as  \\nwell because there\\'s one we had recently and we did a review on we\\'ll put it somewhere and it was a  \\ncomfortable car but this has an added element the added element is it\\'s fun the steering is incredible i  \\ndo not feel i am in a big weighty  suv i apply  the brakes  they work  tremendously  as well i\\'m going  to take \\nthis around a few corners now just to show you because the body lean and roll is so minimal compared  \\nto that of other suvs in this category so the eqc mercedes you\\'ve got the bmw ix3 you\\'ve got the audi  \\ne-tron 55 and this the turning the steering of this car is it\\'s really rather good and would i say it\\'s as  \\ncomfortable as the e -tron 55 no i wouldn\\'t the utron 55 was brilliant with air suspension air suspension  \\nis an added option you can have in this car this is the hse specs you\\'ve got that nice pano roof and  \\nwhatnot but this is better because you\\'ve got that comfort level the ride comfort isn\\'t that bad it\\'s  \\nminimal  the etron  55 year is comfortable  more  but it\\'s not going  to put you off this because  of the added  \\nelement of fun this drives so good it\\'s again i\\'ll say that word like saloon -esque i\\'m not as high up in the  \\ncar i\\'m still in dynamic mode i\\'ve got that performance when i was in the e25 and was put my foot down  \\nit wasn\\'t there immediately and in dynamic mode so the accelerator is a lot more sensitive but i know  \\ni\\'ve finished work i\\'ve jumped into my own pace i want to blow a little bit of steam off what do i do  \\ndynamic jab and it goes immediately it\\'s gone it\\'s gone it\\'s so good and it\\'s multiface ted and that\\'s why i  \\nlove the i -pace and my number three has to be the looks of this car it doesn\\'t look like other electric  \\nvehicles suvs out there and already in the rain i\\'m seeing dog walkers i\\'m seeing people and they\\'re  \\nlooking  at me and they\\'re  looking  at me going  hey that\\'s  a good  looking  car and they are right it looks  so \\ndifferent the big scoop in the vent for the air to flow visibility is great out the front the rear not so much  \\nbut then you remember you have got that that flowing sport back and with other manufacturers you  \\nhave  to pay for that sport  back  this is included  so all in all the look the appearance  the style of this car is \\nsomething really unique a little bit of vanguard and i think for those out there that want to have a  \\npremium suv all electric vehicle and want to be a little bit dif ferent then look no further than this so  \\nthey\\'re my three best things that i love about the car i\\'d love to know what your thoughts are and  \\nwhether you agree or disagree let me know in the comments below inside the car you\\'re looking for a  \\nluxury suv or electric vehicle the leather the materials are great this is some of the softest material i\\'ve  \\never touched on the dash i\\'m not gonna lie and it flows over  there and you get different types of  \\nmaterial on there a little intricate design which i really like n ow level on the door contrasting stitching  \\nbrilliant this is the hse you expect good equipment we\\'re going to throw back to adam because he\\'s in  \\nthe rear i want you to talk to me adam comfort and space go okay we\\'re talking about comfort and  \\nspace actually i think from the outside it doesn\\'t look very big so from the outside i feel like it looks fairly  \\nsmall like the same sort of size as like a i don\\'t know like a golf or something but really when you  \\nactually get in here you\\'ve actually got plenty of knee room let me show you so they\\'re my knees plenty  \\nof room and actually you can see the doors that side there\\'s actually quite a bit of room above f or your  \\nhead so i think i\\'d say it\\'s quite spacious i\\'ve also got a baby seat in here as well so you get a full a full  \\nlook at the back here um plenty of room for the cameras something i would say it\\'s really comfy yeah i  \\nwould say i\\'m pleasantly surprised awesome so it\\'s an all -electric suv vehicle it\\'s got regenerative  \\nbraking but what i love is you can just put it on high harvest as much energy back into that battery and  \\nthen when you turn off the car it will stay in that high mode where other electric v ehicles they forget and  \\nyou have  to re-configure  it where  every  time you get in the buttons  and the satisfaction  you get on some  \\nof these rotary dials are so good and it\\'s a pull and a push so if you push in you\\'ve got your electric  \\nseats and your cool seats you pull it out you can do your climate control and blower and whatnot but  \\nthey\\'re  really  good  i do like a rotary  uh wheel  here so we need  to talk a little bit about  range  jaguars  say \\n\\nthat 292 miles is what this will get in real world terms i\\'m not so sure that\\'s the case especially in the uk  \\nin cold february that\\'s chilly now charging this will take maximum 100 kilowatt charger good luck finding  \\nthem they are rare but if you do every 15 minutes you will add about 18 miles to your battery now in the  \\nupdated 2022 a really cool thing is on board charge is now 11 kilowatts it used to be 7 kilowatts so  \\nwhen you charge it at home in your wall box overnight it used to be 12.6 hours till full b ut now it\\'s 8.6 so  \\nyou\\'re  saving  yourself  four hours  well done  jaguar  good  upgrade  so say you\\'re  only finding  a 50 kilowatt  \\nthen all you need to look at then is every 15 minutes it\\'s around 40 miles added so all in all if you\\'re out  \\nand about and you need to charge fully it\\'s still gonna take just under an hour to get this baby back to  \\nfull charge  they have  updated  it war box is where  it\\'s at 11 kilowatts  get home  park up jab it in 8.6 hours  \\njobs done so in summary the jaguar eye pace is such a great all -rounder and then some because of  \\nthat performance 4.5 seconds not to 60. and the accelerator in dynamic mode is so responsive i love  \\nthat feeling i just i need to get ahead of this yeah and it helps me out i needed to get ahead someone\\'s  \\nparked there and we\\'ve looked at three cool reasons why we talked a little bit about the updates we\\'ve  \\ntalked about the charging as well now you can pick a new 2022 up for around 65 620 pounds so i want  \\nto know  your thoughts what do you think have you agreed with me disagreed let me know everything  \\nthat\\'s going on through your mind right now in the comments below also with jaguar\\'s pvpro system the  \\ncameras are great quality it\\'s really hard to beat really if you look here we\\'ve got the camera set up and  \\nnow it is raining remember but if i click any one of these we get the simulations we can see different  \\nelements of the car and it\\'s not showing it in its greatest light but the quality is there it is raining and i t\\'s \\njust a great feature to point out as well we just want to say a huge thank you to jaguar landrover  \\nnorthampton who have been really accommodating and super helpful so check them out so that has  \\nbeen our episode on the ipace we\\'ve even tested it in the rain for you look at today let\\'s do a summary  \\nwhat have we done i\\'ve told you my reasons why this is the best all -electric suv you can buy right now  \\ni\\'m sure you\\'ve got something to say about it i\\'ve showed you the practical side as well that  \\nperformance n ot to 64.5 seconds it\\'s so much fun let me know all your thoughts about the car in the  \\ncomments below throw me a like get subbed and i\\'ll see you on the next one [Music] you  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2022 I -Pace  \\nReview:  \\n[Music] hi i\\'m richard from drive green and today we\\'re going to be taking a look at the new jaguar  \\ni-pace the i -pace has always been a very impressive ev and today we\\'re going to be looking at what\\'s  \\nnew and improved with this latest model and hopefully at the same time helping you decide whether it  \\nmight be the right ev for you [Music] the i -pace was originally launched back in 2018 into a marketplace  \\nthat was very much dominated by tesla at the premium end and it was hugely successful it won  \\neuropean car of the year and it went on to be the fourth best -selling ev in the uk in 2019 an incredible  \\nachieve ment for such a premium priced car although the i -pace was the first premium electric suv and  \\nalthough it\\'s a very tough act to follow it now lives in a much more competitive ev marketplace you now  \\nhave  the audi e-tron the mercedes  eqc and now the bmw  ix3 as a general  rule i don\\'t  like drawing  direct  \\ncar to car comparisons  every  car has its different  advantages  and disadvantages  and like to bring  those  \\nout and let you decide what\\'s important to you however i must admit compared to its competition the  \\ni-pace generally has set the bar really really high looks wise the i -pace is undoubtedly a good -looking  \\ncar very stylish and with a real presence it doesn\\'t have that typical blocky suv look it manages to look  \\nsleek and sporty at the same time as being quite a high riding car it looks nice from pretty much every  \\nangle and there\\'s some lovely details on the car for example you\\'ve got this sweeping air intake under  \\nthe bonnet here which adds to the car\\'s aerodynamics you\\'ve got this nice grill that you can ha ve in  \\nblack or with chrome detailing like this one here and of course you\\'ve got the lovely jaguar badge in  \\nsporty red the original i -pace just like the new one is an incredibly handsome car its crossover suv  \\nstyling  and sizing  meant  it was also very practical  with plenty  of passenger  space  and a really  generous  \\nboot i don\\'t actually think anything\\'s really been changed with the cars exterior and honestly i haven\\'t  \\n\\nactually  noticed  any notable  differences  at all which  is okay  as the original  i-pace  was and still is a really  \\ngood -looking car and it doesn\\'t yet need an update or there isn\\'t a great deal of room for improvement  \\nin my opinion it\\'s the same story when it comes to the interior of the car which again hasn\\'t really  \\nchanged and it\\'s still as well made and luxurious as the original car this car has a really nice premium  \\nluxury feel about it very nicely designed inside the materials are really good it\\'s very wel l put together it  \\ndoes make you feel very special makes you feel successful like you want in a premium luxury car  \\ngenuinely is a very nice place to be in the new eye pace we\\'re driving today we\\'ve got the performance  \\nseats  as opposed  to the sport  seats  that were  in the the earlier  car we were  driving  before  both are very \\nvery nice uh certainly built to a very premium standard they\\'re very comfy they\\'re very very stylish and  \\nparticularly when you\\'re looking at the higher spec models they\\'re incredibly adjustable they also when  \\nyou\\'re looking at the sc models and the hse models you get a memory seat function and that\\'s both on  \\nthe passenger and driver side you\\'re able to store three different seat settings which is a really nice  \\ntouch [Music] on the top spec hse model as well you\\'ve got called seats also which is a nice touch  of \\nluxury however i always find that a little bit strange the idea of cooling once bottom down there\\'s loads  \\nof space in the front and the back luxury travel for all your passengers especially when the center cup  \\nholder section is pulled down this also doubles up as a pull through hatch when you\\'re carrying a long  \\nitem in the car the boot is plenty big enough to mean the i -pace ticks the all -important practical family  \\nand holiday car roll as well there is also a small storage space under the boot floor and  a small front  \\noffering  some  useful  extra  storage  for charging  cables  for example  i really  was honestly  amazed  at how \\nwell this car actually handles especially given its size and its weight and its high riding suv design  \\nespecially its dynamic sports mode it handles brilliantly [Music] there\\'s plenty of power there ferocious  \\nacceleration  in fact i have  to say probably  it ranks  within  my top few evs in terms  of its actual  handling  it \\nreally does corner like a sports car [Music] it\\'s ground -up ev design and even weight distribution dual  \\nmotor wheel drive format and the 296 kilowatt motor delivers a brilliant handling 400 horsepower car  \\nwith a super  fast four and a half second  naught  to 60 time the i-pace\\'s  truly amazing  and engaging  drive  \\nreally does set it apart from other evs especially in the suv sector as it really is brilliant and i think it\\'s  \\nvery very hard to beat indeed one thing i do like with this new i -pace is they\\'ve given it  a really nice  \\nsound which i know sounds strange because obviously we\\'re used to evs being quiet as they should be  \\nand don\\'t get me wrong this is still a quiet well insulated car and certainly with the stereo one you can\\'t  \\nhear any noise at all however if you like driving a sporty style and really putting your foot down with lots  \\nof acceleration the car makes this wonderful noise i\\'m not sure how well it\\'s going to come out on the  \\ncar\\'s audio but it\\'s a lovely deep rumble it doesn\\'t sound like a car engine nor should it however is a  \\nreally  really  nice sound  and i think  it adds  to the driver  engagement  you know  you really  kind of connect  \\na little bit more to what\\'s going on under the bonnet and i think that adds to the the fun of the car and  \\nthe enjoyability when you\\'re driving well in a performance style another nice driving feature is the car\\'s  \\nslippery surface mode i mean it\\'s not quite a 4x4 however you have got a dual motor all -wheel drive  \\nsetup  and if you\\'ve  got air suspension  on your car and you increase  the ride height  you\\'ve  got you know  \\nquite a capable sort of multi -terrain sort of vehicle and also it adds a lot to safety when you \\'re driving in  \\nparticular in wet slippery icy conditions range -wise jaguars still have the i -paces doing about 280 miles  \\nworth of driving range and whilst that is probably completely possible in the right conditions and with a  \\nperhaps  a sedate  driving  style i think  it\\'s worth  remembering  this is a big heavy  car with lots of power  so \\ni think in most cases you should perhaps reign in your range expectation a little bit more personally i  \\nwould have it around about 220 to maybe 250 miles depending on your preferred driving style it\\'s not  \\nthe most efficient of cars and i would like moving force perhaps to see jaguar squeeze a little bit more  \\nrange  out of their 90 kilowatt  hour battery  however  all this performance  and the fact is a real driver\\'s  car \\nis inevitably going to come at the expense of range 250 miles however is still plenty of rang e for most  \\npeople and the car is also capable of 100 kilowatt charging at the right rapid charger so it is possible to  \\nmore or less fully recharge the car in about an hour most rapid charging is however still done at 50  \\nkilowatts uh as a result i think with a 30 minute charging stop somewhere like the motorway services  \\nyou\\'re going to be looking at delivering about an extra 70 miles of driving range back into the car but  \\nobviously you start with a great driving range 250 miles say to start off with so with a little charging stop  \\nevery now and then you still have a very capable and decent long -range ev the new i -pace is also  \\ncapable of three -phase 11 kilowatt charging if you\\'re lucky enough to have a three -phase fast charger  \\n\\neither at home or at work in all honesty this isn\\'t going to matter to the vast majority of people as not  \\nmany people are going to have a three -phase charger at home as a result of which despite the  \\nupgraded charger you\\'re still going to be charging at seven kilowatts like most tvs however that\\'s going  \\nto give you roughly 20 miles worth of extra range for an hour\\'s worth of charging time at home again  \\nthis isn\\'t really relevant because they\\'re rarely charging from empty to full when those charging\\'s done  \\novernight just like with the original i -pace in the latest model you\\'ve still got three basic trim levels uh  at \\nthe lower end you\\'ve got the s and then you\\'ve got the sc and then the top spec hse on top of these  \\ntrims  there\\'s  also a multitude  of different  spec  items  you can add to your car the lower  spec  s trim is still \\na very very nice car although it does like a few of the premium touches the mid -spec sc on top of the  \\nstandard spec adds quite a few extra bits memory seats 20 inch alloys power tailgate premium led  \\nlights  and nicer  seats  the top spec  hse model  like the bright  blue original  version  we were  driving  earlier  \\ncontains a number of other options as well you\\'ve got matrix led lights cooled seats with even more  \\nadjustment  settings  a meridian  3d surround  sound  stereo  an adaptive  cruise  control  with steering  assist  \\nwith the new i -pace you\\'ve now got an extra trim level available which is the black edition it\\'s available  \\nfundamentally in an sc and hse spec however as standard it comes with a pan roof and adaptive cruise  \\ncontrol however with the black spec it\\'s mainly about the look of the car it has a much mor e aggressive  \\nappeal you\\'ve got black alloys a black grille and a slightly bigger tailgate spoiler there\\'s a whole host of  \\nadditional options you can add to your ips and these include a multitude of different 20 inch alloys  \\nthere\\'s even a couple of 22 inch ones which are massive you\\'ve got the different seats you\\'ve got a  \\nvariety of different color interiors and headliners multiple different finishes on the dash this secondary  \\ntouchscreen here that you use to control the heating system that\\'s an extra item o f spec that you can  \\nadd to the the lower spec s model over a standard on the hse and the se models you\\'ve got the  \\nbeautiful pan roof of course you\\'ve got a 360 degree 3d camera system self parking function you\\'ve got  \\na driver assist package which includes a steering assist as well you\\'ve got a head up display you\\'ve got  \\nthis clear view rear view mirror system you\\'ve also got the air suspension which is an hour smart air  \\nsuspension system which will automatically adjust the ride height when you\\'re going at h igh speed the  \\nupgrade to the air suspension the 3d element to the 360 degree camera system and this rear view  \\nclearview mirror are all new items of spec that are available on the new i -pace the infotainment system  \\nhas also had a bit of an upgrade and whilst uh graphically it looks a little bit more stylish fundamentally  \\nit\\'s just the same as the original version and to be honest it still isn\\'t a very nice system to use the icons  \\nare small and it\\'s poorly structured with multiple submenus and it\\'s just reall y quite hard to get along  \\nwith that being  said whilst  it might  take a little while  to get used  to it if this was your car you would  spend  \\nthe time on it to crack its secrets personally i think the infotainment system is the weakest part of this  \\ncar in fact you could you could say it\\'s the only weak part of the car however it\\'s not a deal breaker  \\nbecause the car more than makes up for it with everything else and if like a lot of people you use  \\nandroid auto or apple carplay both which are stand up within this system then the fact that the jaguar  \\ninterface isn\\'t very good it\\'s going to be largely irrelevant despite all its brilliance and its hig h equipment  \\nlevels especially in the the higher spec models i feel the original i -pace is lacking a few things it doesn\\'t  \\nhave  auto hold and it doesn\\'t  have  stop start functionality  in its adaptive  cruise  control  both of which  are \\nthings that i would expect to see in a premium price tv at this level also there\\'s a bit of a lack of  \\nadjustability in its regen breaking you\\'ve only got two settings and the highest setting for me isn\\'t quite  \\nfierce enough so i would like to see some more settings i\\'d certainly l ike to see a higher regen level so  \\nyou can enjoy a more one pedal driving style and i\\'d also like the regen braking to be more easily  \\naccessible because on the original i -pace you can only adjust it when the car is in park well the good  \\nnews is jaguar have improved these few things um the car now has auto hold which is great that\\'s  \\nsomething i really really did want to see on a car of this price point of this level the adaptive cruise  \\ncontrol  has also been  improved  with the stop start technology  we\\'re  after i also fancy  the regen  level the \\ncar has been increased slightly to give it a more of a more of a one pedal driving experience which you  \\nwant the regen adjustment is still done through the touch screen and there is only a couple of settings  \\nhowever in all honesty it\\'s not too hard to change and in reality to be fair you\\'ll probably set it to high  \\nand you\\'ll just leave it like that for most of the time perhaps only changing it to low when you\\'re cruising  \\nat speed on somewhere like a motorway so the alr eady brilliant i -pace has had multiple improvements  \\nwith this newer latest model whether you\\'re looking at a used original i -pace or whether you\\'re looking  \\n\\nat buying a brand new i -pace like this one here you will not be disappointed the i -pace is a brilliant car  \\nit\\'s very good looking it\\'s very practically sized it\\'s well spec the interior is lovely and it\\'s incredibly well  \\nmade premium car it really is a very special car and it\\'s got the performance handling to match when  \\nyou look at the premium  electric  suv market  i think  the i-pace  has set the bar very high indeed  in fact it\\'s \\ngoing to be a very very hard electric car to be i hope this video has been useful  and help you get a bit  \\nmore  of a feel to the jaguar  eye pace

electric car world in 2018 when jaguar launched the i -pace it beat  \\nbmw audi and mercedes in bringing a premium electric suv to the market and even without much direct  \\ncompetition at the time it proved to be a fantastic electric car but it didn\\'t take long for its rivals to catch  \\nup in barely three years since then the ev landscape is totally different with the i -pace\\'s only real rivals  \\nat launch had tesla badges now it\\'s up against the audi e -tron mercedes eqc bmw ix3 and volvo xc40  \\nrecharge with many more to come the british brand has also announced its plans to become electric  \\nonly from 2025 which is big news and should we be excited for its future or has this once trailblazing  \\npremium electric suv been overtaken and left behind by its new rivals just a few years into its life well  \\nit\\'s just had some updates and we\\'re driving the new i -pace and in this video we\\'re going to tell you all  \\nthe changes and we\\'ll tell you everything else you need to know about the car before we get stuck into  \\nthat save  thousands  of pounds  off your next new car on whatcol.com  and do subscribe  to our channel  if \\nyou want to see all of our other new car reviews let\\'s first talk about what\\'s new with these model year  \\nupdates starting with a few new paint choices like this portofino blue the 18 -inch alloys that were  \\nstandard on s -trim have been replaced with bigger 19 -inch alloys but we\\'ve got the optional 20 -inch \\nalloys here there\\'s also now a chrome style finish to the grille plus you can add an optional bright pack  \\nwhich  we\\'ve  got on this car and gives  you this chrome  surround  as well as a few other  flashy  bits of trim \\non the door mirrors the rear diffuser and the window surrounds but hang on why does it have a grill  \\nbecause if it\\'s an electric car then it doesn\\'t have an engine that needs cooling well i\\'m glad you asked  \\nbecause  this apparently  does  serve  a functional  purpose  to a certain  extent  the grill you can see is filled \\nin but down here this allows air to pass through and help keep the batteries cool while this directs the  \\nair through the bonnet vent accelerating the airflow over the wipers onto the base of the windscreen  \\nthus reducing aerodynamic drag apparently i know this isn\\'t new but while we\\'re talking aero at the rear  \\nof the car apparently the airflow is powerful enough to be one of the reasons that you don\\'t have a rear  \\nwindscreen wiper there\\'s also a special hydrophobic coating on the glass as well so the air come s \\nthrough so powerfully up here and through the back that it just blows the water off the rear windscreen  \\nwhich is great when you\\'re on the motorway but not quite so useful when you\\'re just reversing in the  \\nrain anyway back to the new stuff and the i -pace now has a three -phase 11 kilowatt on -board charger  \\npreviously  it only had a single  phase  seven  kilowatt  on-board  charger  now that means  if you have  an 11 \\nkilowatt home wall box you can now charge at 11 kilowatts and get a naught to 100 charge in around  \\nnine hours previously if you had an 11 kilowatt home war box charger you could only charge at seven  \\nkilowatts  which  would  get you the same  amount  of charge  in almost  13 hours  and you can of course  still \\nfast charge your ipace and we\\'ll talk more about that later the interior changes bring some extra  \\nequipment  the 360 degree  3d camera  now comes  as standard  plus the clearsight  digital  rearview  mirror  \\nwhich  we first saw in the range  rover  evoke  is now available  as an option  both front seats  are heated  as \\nstandard  and there\\'s  wireless  phone  charging  across  the lineup  too the optional  meridian  sound  system  \\nnow has an extra two speakers up here there\\'s also a cabin air ionization system as well the system  \\ncan be used with the i -pace\\'s pre -conditioning system to clear the cabin of allergens but perhaps the  \\n\\nbiggest  news  inside  is this updated  infotainment  system  so now it has jaguar  land rover\\'s  pv pro system  \\nwhich before this you could only find on the land rover defender it\\'s got the same physical layout and  \\nsetup as before so up here you\\'ve got a 10 inch screen with a 5 inch screen lower down here but if you  \\ngo for a jaguar i -pace s the entry -level trim then this lower screen is an optional extra and without it you  \\nget a kind of touch sensitive button layout instead so now the infotainment system has a revamped  \\nmenu layout and the navigation system has been updated as well but you get apple carplay and  \\nandroid auto as standard so surely you\\'re just better off using google maps or waze anyway as you  \\nwould be in any other car and the system itself isn\\'t the best out there so the problems with it are that it  \\ncan still be a little bit laggy when you\\'re jumping between the different functions and also there\\'s quite a  \\nlot of menus  and sub menus  and it\\'s quite  baffling  to try and get your head  around  it all plus these  icons  \\nare still quite  small  they were  on the previous  model  and now they\\'ve  kind of moved  them  around  a little \\nbit but they\\'re still quite small which means if you\\'re driving it\\'s just difficult to hit them accurately and so  \\nwhen you compare it to the bmw ix3 and the mercedes eqc they both have better systems partly  \\nbecause  they offer some  level of physical  control  to use the infotainment  system  with a rotary  dial in the \\nbmw ix3\\'s case you do still have physical dials in the eye pace for the climate controls and these  \\nactually work quite well so you push them in to control the seat heating and you pull them out again to  \\ncontrol the fan speed and the temperature and actually even though there is some element of touch  \\nscreen complicatedness in the middle this actually works pretty well just like before you also still get a  \\n12.3 inch digital driver display which is good nice and bright and clear you can also choose what you\\'re  \\nlooking at by using these controls on the steering wheel and also they look like they might be touch  \\nsensitive controls but they\\'re actual buttons that you need to press which is good because if they were  \\ntouch sensitive you can sometimes be accidentally turning things on that you don\\'t mean to be like we  \\nhave seen in the new vw id3 for example but no such problems here and generally this is a very  \\nimpre ssive interior we said when the i -pace was first launched that it was jaguar\\'s best interior and a  \\nfew years on that does still remain the case the materials are very good and the fit and finish generally  \\nis impressive but you can see there\\'s a bit of wobbles here and there so it\\'s not quite consistent  \\nthroughout the entire interior which is why ultimately the audi e -tron is a bit better for fit and finish  \\nbecause it is put together a little better but it is extremely boring by comparison the i -pace does fe el \\nreally special inside and it\\'s quite practical too so you\\'ve got a lot of storage trays like this wireless  \\nphone charging up here somewhere to put the key or a pen there a couple of cup holders and this  \\nmassive central bin here you can even take these cup holders out so all things considered not much  \\nhas changed really but it is still a very good interior up front there\\'s enough room for a couple of six  \\nfooters to properly lounge out and feel pretty comfortable in the back of the eye pace here you can se e \\ni\\'m just under six foot legroom is good headroom no problem really decent amount available there and  \\nit\\'s more spacious back here than in the back of the ix3 or the mercedes eqc but you have got a bit of a  \\nsloping and curving roofline and these windows are quite small so an audi e -tron does feel a bit more  \\nspacious and open back here plus these rear seats don\\'t really do anything particularly clever in an ix -3 \\nyou can recline the outer rear seats but in the eye pace you do have some trays under the seats in the  \\nback here but they\\'re a bit awkward to get to because you can\\'t pull them out and they\\'ve got this nasty  \\nfeeling plastic on the entry point you have a couple of isofix mounts on the outer rear seats plus you  \\ncan pull this down for an arm rest and a couple of cup holders you can even fold this entire seat down  \\ncompletely to give yourself very easy access to the boot or to put your skis through but there isn\\'t a  \\nseven seat option in the i -pace it is 5c only which means the tesla model x remains for now  the only  \\n7-seat electric  suv the i-pace\\'s  boot isn\\'t the biggest  around  but you still wouldn\\'t  describe  it as small  we \\nmanaged to fit seven carry -on sized suitcases into the boot below the parcel shelf here which by  \\ncomparison the audi e -tron and also the ix -3 managed to fit eight suitcases and the model s got a  \\nridiculous 11 into  its boot but  still here  you can see  simple shape easy  proportions and  a decent  \\namount of underfloor storage for the charging cables but not much else it\\'s also handy you might think  \\nhaving an extra boot in the front where the engine would have been or not i can just about f it my phone  \\nin the front here but not much else anyway let\\'s go for a drive so the first thing to point out is that these  \\nupdates haven\\'t really had any impact on how the i -pace drives so it\\'s still got a 90 kilowatt -hour battery  \\npack it\\'s got two electric motors one on the front axle one on the rear axle making it all -wheel drive and  \\nit has 395 brake horsepower which is a lot and it has a naught to 60 miles per hour time of just 4.5  \\n\\nseconds which is properly rapid admittedly not quite as quick as what the tesla model s offers but still  \\ncompared to pretty much everything else on the road that is very quick indeed but with the i -pace it\\'s  \\nnot just about  straight  line acceleration  because  it also handles  pretty  well too the batteries  are beneath  \\nthe floor so it\\'s got a nice low centre of gravity it also has acclaimed 50 50 weight distribution as well  \\nfront to rear and when you\\'re on a twisty road behind the wheel with this nice precise well -weighted  \\nsteering it is good to drive it definitely doesn\\'t feel like a high -riding suv part of that sensation comes  \\nfrom the slightly more saloon -like driving position you get with the i -pace sitting you a bit closer to the  \\nground than the e -tron and the eqc this can tackle a corner way better than those cars a s well in the  \\ne-tron and in the eqc there\\'s a lot more body lane but while the i -pace is good to drive there is now one  \\nother  electric  suv that is actually  better  the i-pace  has swatted  away  competition  from the e-tron and the \\neqc in the handling stakes but the bmw ix3 does have it beaten it\\'s even more agile and enjoyable to  \\ndrive and with the i -pace there does come a point where you feel it has too much power for what it\\'s  \\nable to handle and the stability control can be very abrupt in its interventions now admittedly y ou do  \\nneed to be going very quickly for that to be noticeable but even in normal driving the ix3 it\\'s got slightly  \\nnicer  steering  it\\'s got better  body  control  it\\'s a really  really  good  suv but so too is the eye pace  and if out \\nand out performance is your thing then this is comfortably quicker than the ix3 it\\'s also all -wheel drive  \\nwhereas the bmw is rear -wheel drive only now we\\'re not claiming that the i -pace is some  \\ndefender -esque off -road king but it has got some modern snow settings it\\'s also got hill ascent and  \\ndescent controls and if you tick the optional air suspension then you can adjust its ride height too which  \\nis handy for the treacherous surrey terrain this will no doubt be tasked with braving which brings us on  \\nto the ride now on the 18 -inch alloys you could get before with the standard passive suspension the  \\ni-pace was a really comfortable thing now that you can only get 19 -inch alloys as the smallest wheels  \\nwe suspect it\\'s probably going to be a little bit firmer but should still be a pretty comfortable electric car  \\nwe\\'ve got 20 -inch alloys on this test car with adaptive suspension both of which will cost extra but if you  \\nfork out for it you do still get a very comfortable electric car it absorbs initial impacts really well off the  \\nroad much better than something like an eqc but when you have got this in comfo rt mode with this  \\nadapter  suspension  and there  is quite  a bit of movement  in the car but it doesn\\'t  become  uncomfortable  \\nand you can also tighten it up by putting it in dynamic mode although if you do that you get quite a few  \\nmore audible thumps through the suspension but it\\'s still nothing like you\\'d experience in the eqc and  \\ngenerally this is a comfortable car that seems very well suited to british tarmac an e -tron is ultimately  \\nmore comfortable and quieter and actually that is the benchmark of ev comfort  the ix -3 even without  \\nsophisticated air suspension is also really well controlled and comfortable we\\'ve spoken about how  \\nquick the eyepiece is but what about slowing down well you have regenerative braking like you do in  \\nevery other electric car so when you lift off the accelerator the car will slow itself down there are two  \\ndifferent settings for it high and low but the annoying thing is to switch between them you\\'ve got to dive  \\ninto the infotainment system find various different menus and submenus and th en finally get to it so it\\'s  \\nannoying  it\\'s as complicated  as that but the good  thing  is that when  you decide  what  setting  you want  to \\nuse the car will stay in that setting even if you turn it off leave come back to the car so when you start it  \\nagain it will remain in whatever it was in before which is quite useful because probably you\\'re just going  \\nto get in this stick it on high and then forget about it but it\\'s annoying that the same doesn\\'t happen for  \\nthe drive mode so if you stick it in eco while you\\'re driving then you stop get out come back it will go  \\nback to its default comfort setting it won\\'t stay in eco which can be a little bit  irritating another annoying  \\nthing the view out the back yes you\\'ve got a nice swooping roofline but it does result in quite a letterbox  \\nview out the back  of the car which  i guess  is another  reason  to consider  going  for this optional  rear view \\nmirror camera but overall driving the ipays is a pleasant comfortable enjoyable experience even now  \\nthese updates haven\\'t changed anything really and it\\'s got a lot more electric car rivals that it\\'s up  \\nagainst it still stacks up very well indeed but what else do you need to know about the jaguar i -pace it\\'s  \\npriced from 65 000 to 75 000 pounds which isn\\'t cheap but it is very similar to the pricing of the audi  \\ne-tron and the mercedes eqc although the bmw ix3 is a little bit cheaper also the i -pace has been  \\naround  for a little longer  than those  rivals  so there  are a few more  choices  to be had on the used  market  \\nthe i-pace also starts to look pretty good value when you consider its official range which is 292 miles  \\nnow admittedly that\\'s further than the e -tron the ix -3 and the eqc but with all of those cars it\\'s difficult to  \\nachieve that claimed official range but in our official independent testing we recorded a r esult of 253  \\n\\nmiles from a full charge in the i -pace which is very good indeed however just bear in mind if you aren\\'t  \\nfussed about a premium badge there are a growing number of more mainstream electric suvs that offer  \\nsimilarly impressive ranges for a lot less money when it comes to charging the i -pace up we\\'ve already  \\ntalked about the new 11 kilowatt on -board charger but just like before the maximum charging speed  \\naccepted by the car is 100 kilowatts and that\\'s great and means from a rapid charger you can get a  \\nnaught to eighty percent charge in about 40 minutes the problem is 100 kilowatt charges are still quite  \\nrare in the uk more common are 50 kilowatt charges where you\\'ll get a naught to 80 charge in about 85  \\nminutes but all of those evs are at the mercy of third -party charging networks which are improving but  \\nstill complicated to use and poorly maintained all teslas have a huge advantage here by having access  \\nto the american brand\\'s absolutely fantastic supercharger network the i -pace is really well equipped  \\neven en try-level s -trim comes with loads of kit but if you do go for that then it might be worth  \\nconsidering the drive assist pack on the options list because it adds adapter cruise control and steering  \\nassist jaguar doesn\\'t have the best record when it comes to reliability but the i -pace is covered by a  \\nthree -year unlimited mileage warranty which is pretty standard for electric cars also common with every  \\nother electric car the battery is covered by a separate warranty in the i -pace that is eight years or a  \\nhundr ed thousand miles [Music] the jaguar i -pace was a fantastic electric car when it launched and the  \\ntruth is even now with a new crop of very impressive competitors it still stacks up very well indeed it\\'s  \\ngot a fantastic range it\\'s a nice thing to drive and it\\'s plush inside we can understand if you go for an  \\nix-3 instead being even better to drive and cheaper but the i -pace is still a very recommendable electric  \\nsuv if jaguar\\'s bold electric future has this as a starting point there are plenty of reasons to be excited  \\nfor its next products save thousands of pounds off your

house i\\'m thomas and i\\'m james and this is the extra channel yep that\\'s what  \\nyou told me to stop there i know because they always they know what that is now do they yeah yeah  \\nwhat if they don\\'t what if they\\'re new it\\'s a more casual one we have another channel it\\'s the main  \\nchannel this is the extra one and today we\\'re featuring so we\\'ve been filming some really cool stuff on  \\nour california trip yeah but this has been keeping us going noble steed yeah and this is the 2022 jaguar  \\ni-pace which means it\\'s the electric one because there is an e -pace which sounds like it would be  \\nelectric that makes noise but it\\'s not it\\'s just a smaller f -pace right so that\\'s petrol but this is dual motor  \\nlithium all -wheel drive it\\'s not a lead acid battery we know that it is it\\'s all -wheel drive wheel drive range  \\nthe range is 253 miles so it\\'s not world breaking let\\'s see if i can stump him is it bigger or smaller than a  \\nuh than an ev6 i don\\'t know about the actual length but the wheelbase is bigger and  it\\'s just underneath  \\nthe uh ionic 5. this photograph\\'s big it looks like a big thing yeah when you see a picture of this it looks  \\nbigger than the ionic five would be but it\\'s not but the ionic five is bigger it\\'s actually kind of low too this  \\nhas got some ev6 looking side yeah yeah yeah it does yeah it looks like it is absolutely prioritized  \\npassenger  space  like this is a big old honking  door look at the length  of that but the ev6 is bigger  it feels  \\nbigger at least standing next to it but i mean you expect this since it\\'s a jag and not a kia to be nicer  \\nright yeah  it\\'s more  money  it is this so this is 70 grand  70 grand  u.s we\\'ll get the canadian  price  okay  um \\nbut they\\'ve they\\'ve knocked off the price like it\\'s this is the hsc it only comes in hse now which is the jlr  \\nfancy trim and it is 11 000 cheaper than it was so it\\'s the same price as the base was and it\\'s currently  \\nat 30 battery and it says 78 miles who\\'s got range anxiety we don\\'t we do oh we do n\\'t no no um but  \\nyeah it is a jaguar it does cost more it doesn\\'t provide any more range than the others it looks cool  \\nthough  it it looks  pretty  cool i think  it looks  pretty  cool this isn\\'t a funny  color  it\\'s kind of champagne  and i \\nwill never support champagne but this one they\\'ve called it aruba aruba aruba jamaica um okay fine i\\'ll  \\n\\nbeat you i mean this you want to go through this every single time it\\'s up to you it\\'s like it\\'s you know it\\'s  \\na trial trial all right that\\'s fine you ready we\\'re going on three uh yeah we\\'ll throw on three ready okay  \\none two three one two three one two three what is this is a karate chop that is not it\\'s not in the  \\npassenger seat broke my streak okay driving james i told you to wear the same clothes now they\\'re  \\ngonna know it\\'s a different day it\\'s not a different day that\\'s the difference that\\'s yourself d o a bunch of  \\nwardrobe  changes  yeah  we\\'re  now in a totally  different  canyon  following  a group  of porsche  enthusiasts  \\n911 enthusiasts specifically yes oh there\\'s a couple there\\'s a caveman in there there came in there  \\ncaiman  that was dressed  as a gt4 and he\\'s actually  a gts right or it\\'s a gt4 and he\\'s down  bash  and then \\nthere was a gt the turbo dressed as a gt2 anyway electric cars so that stuff we were talking about the  \\nprice yeah this is we found out the canadian price by the way it starts at 99 900 or something says 100  \\n000 canadian for this yes which is a significant amount of money because it out prices the model y long  \\nrange it out prices the new bmw ix yep it\\'s but like it\\'s very nice in here yeah very nice and if you listen  \\nclosely it makes the weird thrum of a flat six you know what it can do it can stay with nine  elevens on a  \\ncanyon run yeah yeah we literally are look at that anyway we\\'ll get to that in a second gravel gravel and  \\ngravity i think is going to be the issue what is flying around oh the charging cable the charging cable so  \\nwe\\'ve we\\'ve actually had charging adventures with this car since you last saw us okay um so we  \\nmanaged to charge this they\\'ve they\\'ve increa they\\'ve improved the on -board charger for this so  \\nbeforehand if you\\'ve got an eye pace it would have been 12 and a half hours at home to charge which  \\nis we\\'ve talking about this that\\'s actually too long that means if you go to bed and wake up in the  \\nmorning you\\'re not fully charged now it\\'s eight and a half hours so you can go to bed and wake up like i  \\nneed to get on your level of caffeine right now i\\'m just i\\'m a morning guy you know okay i can\\'t turn the  \\nway the 911\\'s turn i can feel the weight this way he\\'s 48 fill the gap in with this yeah there\\'s plenty of  \\ntorque we\\'ve got 512 pound feet of torque so this does four and a half seconds to 60. an d i have  \\nhustled this thing around canyons and honestly it is severely impressive yeah there\\'s no feel to the  \\nsteering  whatsoever  no there  absolutely  is feel no it is not were  you in the right mode  i tried every  mode  \\ni tried all the modes and there\\'s this is absolutely waiting up in the corner okay it\\'s waiting up there\\'s no  \\nfeel to it okay so it\\'s like a maserati mc20 whoa back up back up back up yeah okay it feels that it feels  \\nconfident this drives even though it\\'s the bigger looking thing we mentioned about the ionic five yeah  \\nthis drives the way i wanted the ionic five to drive pretty much it drives the way the ionic five looks and  \\nthe ev6 look but those  drive  a little bit more  soft and not sharp  and this is twice  the price  with less range  \\nless ability to charge at speed because it this thing here\\'s the squeal from the tires it\\'s a cyclist but it\\'s  \\nit\\'s such an impressive car to drive the drive i did not expect i know it\\'s a jag so i should have been a bit  \\nmore like you know should have given it some credit but yeah yeah i mean you look at it and you  \\nassume it\\'s just going to be kind of another those are your sunglasses yeah um um i assume it\\'s gonna  \\nbe just kind of another kind of crossover thing right but they did obviously spend some time tuning the  \\ndamping can you switch me into a more aggressive driving mode i think i\\'m doing this whole thing in  \\neco right now you are yeah that\\'s raining right nice quickly yeah i need to be in sports dynamic oh yeah  \\noh the gauges go red see now if we\\'re in trouble for going fast all the porsches are in trouble first so  \\nwe\\'re just like yeah we\\'re gonna go tell them off that\\'s what we\\'re doing i love that i can just stamp on it  \\nhere just catch up we\\'ll just we\\'ll just play if we get pulled over we\\'ll just play the card of i just thought  \\nthis is we\\'re just with traffic i don\\'t know yeah we\\'re forcing it right now oh my god this this guy\\'s having  \\nthe worst canyon run because he\\'s got to feel like he\\'s like i\\'m just i\\'m i\\'m pushing it here and this like  \\nsuv is this wasn\\'t planned by the way we just turned on the canyon and we\\'re like screw it we\\'ll do it  \\nyeah so it doesn\\'t charge as fast as some of the cheaper options it doesn\\'t have as much range but the  \\nrange is actually fine the problem is i find is that it does it\\'s just very expensive now and it\\'s also not  \\nsuper consistent with how much range it tells you it has left no no but we had an okay cha rging  \\nexperience in fact let\\'s talk about that in a minute because we don\\'t talk about the charging experience  \\nnow the okay charging experience i i mean it was okay yeah you were just really tired but the caveat  \\nhere is if you have an ev you probably have a charger at home which we don\\'t have so we have to face  \\nthe extra logistics of not having that and last night we drove home from willow springs to la which is  \\nabout  two hour drive  yeah  and we didn\\'t  have  enough  range  to start with so the car didn\\'t  let us down  in \\nterms of expectation but it means we had to stop at an electrify america charger yes which didn\\'t work  \\nthe first one didn\\'t work and not only that even if you could justify the charge times to yourself like this  \\n\\ntakes this said an hour and three minutes to fall to fall yeah uh and i think it\\'s like 40 minutes to 80 the  \\nthing  that we didn\\'t  account  for was a queue  for the charges  there\\'s  only three  of them  and they were  all \\nbeing used so that\\'s another extra block of time so i can\\'t believe how well this car drives by the way  \\nyeah  i know  i can i\\'m feeling  it these  911\\'s  gotta  feel terrible  i bought  this for a reason  oh it hustles  yeah  \\nit really really does we were using this to to chase down uh ferraris and mc20s is a camera car in the  \\ncanyons and it did it no problem i bet the mustang marquee could probably do this just as well the  \\nmustang market could credit to the marquee it\\'s got great driving dynamics and it is also about  half the  \\nprice a little bit more so that\\'s i think that\\'s the biggest issue here is that this now even if they even with  \\nthe changes  they\\'ve  made  and they\\'ve  upgraded  this infotainment  you\\'ve  gone  without  you yeah  so this \\nis i don\\'t think i\\'ve ever been in a jlr car where the infotainment has worked no except for this one this is  \\nthe first time this screen has not malfunctioned and it has been totally fine and usable and it\\'s  \\nreasonably fast and it\\'s just the rest of it\\'s more even more usable than than a tesla or whatever right  \\nbecause we\\'ve got a lot of hard buttons versus the stuff that matters right the climate control is a bit  \\nweird with these knobs and stuff but i you know i got used to it i\\'m fine and like i\\'m assumin g these are  \\nlike some sort of like vegan leather or something i don\\'t even know i didn\\'t look it up but they\\'re really  \\nthe leather is really nice everything feels very very comfortable and the seats are great also it\\'s so quiet  \\non the highway very quiet so quiet right not like a lack of engine noise just the insulation from the road  \\nyeah on a concrete highway that\\'s where it would embarrass the ionic fives and the ev6 i think so i said  \\nto thomas i was like you know how much would you pay if everything else was the same as ionic five  \\nhow much  would  you pay for the level of quietness  this brings  and we both kind of agreed  on like the 10 \\ngrand 10 grand yeah like like 10 grand would give if it gave me it doesn\\'t though it\\'s way more yeah it\\'s  \\nas like aspect it\\'s because it\\'s the hst over a top trim ionic 5 ev6 it\\'s 40 grand canadian more so  \\nwhatever that is 25 us more but it is a jag and there is a badge associated with it and its driving  \\ndynamics wipe the floor with those cars and the range isn\\'t far off so i to tally get this guy i think this car  \\nhas been  slept  on and i\\'m part of the problem  it is i\\'ve always  just been  like oh it\\'s the ipace  that\\'s  one of \\nthose early ev ones yeah this is one of the early that\\'s exactly what it is it\\'s an earl\\'s one of those early  \\nones that they did it as like an experiment or to lower their their fleet average fuel economy or whatever  \\nit was right but this is now a good ev no question if you bought this and you spent more money over an  \\nionic five i would go good job good work yeah good choice like like 100 it\\'s it\\'s not it\\'s not a question  \\nwhether or not um it\\'s good enough for the price it\\'s a question of whether or not you  want to pay the  \\nprice and i thought we\\'d be snubbed at the charger i thought the guys in the id4 and the kona electric  \\nwould be like oh this one oh we\\'ve got the eye pace oh yeah and then everyone was so i was so ready  \\nto be like yeah yeah i know everyone was so nice yeah and they were like hey i\\'m just gonna be done  \\nin a minute um because we can work out the etiquette if someone\\'s at 92 percent and we and we\\'re  \\nwe\\'re like waiting in queues yeah because you can see you can see how much charge they\\'ve got i f \\nsomeone\\'s at 90 and we\\'re sitting there like ah like are they expected to be like you know what that is  \\nenough for me right now yeah or do you let them get to 100 because if we were about to knock on the  \\nwindow but excuse me have you had enough yeah but he told us he\\'d almost finished he ended up  \\nbeing a very nice gentleman so i\\'m glad that we didn\\'t say anything oh my god so it can do a 911 can  \\nyou run yeah  it\\'s ranger\\'s  okay  the interior  is wonderful  yeah  the materials  are lovely  as you said it looks  \\npretty  cool right it looks  pretty  cool it\\'s just it\\'s a bit expensive  but you know  what  it could  generate  some  \\ng-forces yeah but for the panache of the brand the nash that\\'s the word it sounds like something from  \\nbritish bake off yeah oh that\\'s a chocolate panache is that ganache it\\'s a ganache no that\\'s a i don\\'t  \\nknow  it\\'s very early  in the morning  so we\\'ve  lost some  of our vocabulary  but the brand  associated  with it \\nwhich is quite fancy oh it\\'s a thin bit of road i\\'m just gonna take it big yeah it\\'s  quite a fancy brand yep  \\nit\\'s quite a fancy car i think it\\'s worth the money i mean if you\\'re looking for an ev that\\'s different and  \\ncool and nice it drives well i mean it\\'s good it\\'s maybe like some people might consider it a little bit  \\noverpriced  but i don\\'t  think  it is i think  the people  buying  it aren\\'t  going  to care probably  not no because  i \\nthink from from the driver\\'s seat i have no problems with this car it\\'s been lovely and it\\'s just  \\nembarrassing  911s  so well i\\'ve slowed  down  now just because  and you\\'re  still keeping  up well i can just \\nplant my foot and make up the gap it does make some sounds oh there it goes you\\'re really on i t that\\'s  \\nactually i think that\\'s one of the first times i\\'ve heard that yeah i mean it\\'s great yeah it\\'s great i can\\'t  \\nprobably can\\'t embarrass a thai cat but normal 911\\'s full of dads full of dads for sure you  \\n\\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2022 I -Pace  \\nReview:  \\ng\\'day i\\'m paul so jaguar was one of the first premium brands to have a ev to market and jaguar took it  \\none step further by developing a bespoke ev platform while a lot of manufacturers just took an internal  \\ncombustion car through some ev components in and said hey here it is and it\\'s either efficient or  \\neffective so jaguar being the first to market does that mean they are the most successful well not really  \\nthey haven\\'t really sold a great deal of these so today i just want to take it for a spin and figure out \\nwhat\\'s going on what\\'s wrong with this why are people not buying it so the ipace kicks off in australia  \\nfrom a little over 140 000 today we\\'re reviewing the sc specification which is the entry level this  \\ncompetes with things like the bmw ix the mercedes -benz eqc and the audi e -tron so there are a few  \\ncompetitors now in this segment today we\\'re going to do a detailed review of this car so if you do want  \\nto skip ahead to other parts of the review you can use those time codes on the screen or if you\\'re on  \\nyoutube scroll down and use the chapters below and if you haven\\'t done so already subscribe to our  \\nchannel press the bell icon that\\'s going to tell you every single time i swap my face [Music] let\\'s talk  \\nabout the exterior so you\\'ve got 12 external colors to pick from they\\'re all free of charge except two that  \\nare like a 3 900 option now what about the design so one of the key differences here with the ipace is  \\nthat they\\'ve made it look quite different to the regular car and i think maybe that\\'s one of the reasons it  \\nhasn\\'t been as successful if you look at things like the eqc and you know the e -tron as well they just  \\nlook like other versions of a mercedes -benz or an audi whereas this looks completely different look  \\nstyling  is subjective  but i actually  think  this looks  pretty  good  it turns  a lot of heads  out on the road and it \\nreally is just such a different car to see out there and i love down the bottom here it looks like the grill  \\njust ends  here but it actually  continues  all the way through  to this opening  up the top here and that goes  \\nover the top of the car and pushes down on the rear window which means they don\\'t need to have a  \\nwiper so that saves weight and also uses less electricity so pretty clever innovation there now behind  \\nthis grille there you do have some engine or some motor components rather you can access those  \\nbehind the bonnet here and there\\'s some cooling down the bottom there as well got a camera down  \\nhere for the 360 camera this car is optioned with the black pack so kind of just blacks out all the  \\nelements on and i think it looks fantastic especially here with the black body color as well over here you  \\nhave a set of full led headlights these aren\\'t matrix led though you\\'ve got to pay extra for that which i  \\nreckon is a little bit disappointing matrix led lights really should be standard on you know most cars  \\ntoday especially premium brands a little air vent out here that kicks out to the side here around the side  \\nwe have  a set of 20 inch alloy wheels i do like this design  as well so continuing  on with that black  theme  \\nit\\'s got a matte black finish to it so it really gives this bit of a mean look out on the road it kind of just  \\nhides all of the design elements and i think it looks really nice there i find it interesting as well here that  \\nif you have a look at the brakes so typically in an eva you don\\'t really use brakes all that much for the  \\nmechanical brakes it uses region and that means you do get a whole lot more brake life out of your  \\nvehicle some of the ev manufacturers like the bmw with the ix have gone with big fla shy brakes but you  \\ncan see here with jag they\\'ve  just kept it fairly  minimal  there  with a smaller  rotor and just a standard  sort \\nof caliper  on the car you\\'ve  got your specification  down  the side here s e and then jaguar  lettering  up on \\nthe top here you\\'ve got an indicator built into that wing mirror with another camera there for the 360  \\ncamera in terms of the door handles when you lock the car these disappear into the car and then when  \\nyou unlock it they pop out like that so it actually sort of sits flush with the car while you\\'re driving so  \\nagain reducing the amount of drag meaning you\\'re able to get by without using as much electricity this  \\ncar has optional privacy glass and then come around to the back so you can see up the top here th is is \\nwhat i was talking about you get the air rushing through here along that back window and then this tiny  \\nlittle spoiler kicks it off the end there so that means that you\\'re not getting any water pooling on here  \\nand that all of the air that you have flying over the car just disperses now it is interesting with spoilers i  \\nlearnt a lot when we did our drag parison with the 911 turbo the spoilers actually help reduce turbulent  \\n\\nairflow behind the car which means you get less what do they call it turbulent kinetic energy i think it\\'s  \\ncalled and that means that the car doesn\\'t have to work as hard to push itself along so click up here to  \\nwatch that video that was really good fun to film we go into a bit more detail about that so up the top  \\nthere  you can see the little camera  in that shark  fin aerial  means  that we get a digital  version  on the rear \\nview mirror instead of just a standard one we\\'ve got led tail lights along the back her e and then the  \\ndesignation for the car ev400 all -wheel drive now i think jaguar was meant to do a more powerful  \\nversion of this car but given the brand has said that it won\\'t be announcing any new models between  \\nnow and 2025 when it goes full electric there is a chance here that we won\\'t be seeing any more  \\npowerful versions of the eye pace until that time rolls around so we are inside the eye pace we\\'ll start  \\noff with the key so there it is you\\'ve got lock unlock front boot back boot panic then on the back you \\nhave jaguar written there it\\'s a proximity sensing case you can leave that in your pocket and then once  \\nyou\\'re inside you have a push button start just there so this car has been out for a little while now and i  \\nthink the design is starting to show its age yes jaguar has gone to the effort of putting pv pro in here  \\nexcellent infotainment system i\\'ll run you through that in a bit more detail soon but there is so much  \\nblank space around there you just do wonder why they didn\\'t go for a bigger infotainment  screen given  \\nit is you know an electric car and they want to be up to date with tech even this stuff down the bottom is  \\nstarting to look and feel a little bit old the screen\\'s just small and it looks just a little bit low resolution  \\ncompared to pv pro but if you put that to one side i think from a design perspective it still actually looks  \\npretty  good  you got these  uh brushed  aluminium  elements  sort of splitting  up the black  sections  then up \\nthe top it\\'s all soft touch material that really sort of emphasizes this as bei ng a premium offering in the  \\njaguar range and that\\'s all backed up by that screen ahead of the driver as well now what about your  \\ntouch points so in the center there that\\'s firmish and then soft on the door how soft are they well we\\'ve  \\ngot our durometer  we\\'ve  tested  the main  surfaces  in this cabin  if you want  to see how this car compares  \\nto others that we\\'ve tested before look at the link in the description now what about build quality so all  \\nactually feels pretty good to me i will actually mention that we had one of these as a long -term loan  \\nvehicle a little while back and the build quality was actually pretty good on it as well and door test that  \\nall sounds nice and solid let\\'s talk about infotainment so you would have seen pv pro in some of the  \\nother jaguar android products we\\'ve tested recently we do actually have a detailed review of this you  \\ncan click up here to watch that so today i\\'ll just take you through some of the high level stuff plus a new  \\nfeature that is now being rolled out to all of these vehicles with pv pro so here in the eye pace it\\'s a 10  \\ninch display you can actually go i think all the way up to a 14 inch display and i remember that being in  \\nthe f-pace svr that we tested i thought that was such a beautiful looking screen and a g reat setup there  \\nbut the highlights here are that you have shortcuts here on the main screen you can then scroll through  \\nand add any extra things that you want to add to that main screen as well to further customize it in  \\naddition to that you have status indicators on the side here for the vehicles 4g also your phone\\'s  \\nreception and your phone\\'s battery as well now on the radio front you have am fm and dab plus digital  \\nradio you can  get the high -end optional sound system  that adds more  speakers and  all that  kind of \\nthing but the standard sound system is actually pretty good in its regular form in terms of smartphone  \\nmirroring this is another update that came through as part of an over -the-air update there\\'s now  \\nwireless apple carplay and wireless android auto i\\'ll show you what apple carplay looks like first so  \\nthere it is there pretty fast response and it takes up that whole screen as well which means you\\'re  \\ngetting that full integration you can of course then send voice commands through the car to apple  \\ncarplay if you need to this is what android auto looks like so again full screen integration and nice and  \\nquick as well now let\\'s touch on something that is new to jaguar land rover and that is the integration of  \\nalexa into their infotainment systems now you might think to yourself what is the purpose of that what\\'s  \\nthe big deal why can\\'t i just use siri well the big deal is that it is native to the infotainment system and  \\nthe infotainment system is probably one of the better units on the market today because it\\'s instant on  \\nyou get inside the car it\\'s ready to roll your smartphone mirroring is there it is sort of ready to do  \\neverything you needed to do and when it comes to that alexa integration you\\'re able to control your  \\nhome from the car so for example if you have lights in your driveway or something like that that you  \\nwant to switch on as you come home you\\'re able to tell the car and it will then send the command  \\nthrough so we\\'ve set up some amazon devices at home and this is some of the stuff that i\\'ve bee n \\nplaying with so let\\'s give this a shot hey alexa turn the air conditioner on and set it to 22 degrees okay  \\n\\nhey alexa turn the lamp on okay hey alexa play car expert on youtube in the kitchen searching youtube  \\nhey alexa who is paul marrick this might answer your question according to the department of health  \\nand human services paul merrick is a physician based in winfield illinois who specializes in urology  \\nokay that\\'s obviously not right um hey alexa who is paul martich according to wikipedia paul murray uh  \\nhey alexa who is paul merrick paul marie is a motoring journalist and based in australia there we go  \\nokay she got there in the end so what i\\'m trying to get at here is the alexa integration means that if you  \\ndo have  devices  at home  even  devices  that aren\\'t  amazon  branded  like the air conditioner  and stuff like \\nthat you can get it to activate all of it from the car so while you are on the way home it\\'ll do everything  \\nfrom here so the reason i\\'m excited about that stuff is because it begins that connected future with your  \\nhome it means your car can actually be part of your home and can interact with your home so i\\'m  \\nexcited to see where this takes us and where they can develop this technology from here given it is like  \\nliterally just released now before i show you the screen head of the driver i want to run you thr ough one  \\nfeature here and it is the jaguar application so once you crack the application open it comes up with  \\nyour car you know mileage and that sort of stuff you\\'ve also got electric details so range uh charging  \\nschedules and all the sort of basic functions you need to have active for operating the vehicle as an ev  \\nalso gives you the status of what the car is doing but if you go over here to remote you can set things  \\nlike you climb it out let me give it my face there you can set things like you climb it l ock and unlock the  \\ncar remotely  and also initiate  charging  if you need  to you have  your journeys  there  as well so look pretty  \\nfully featured app and a big improvement over when this car launched because it used to be quite slow  \\nto actually  do anything  it is much  faster  now which  is good  news  now the screen  ahead  of the driver  is a \\n12.3 inch display  you can configure  what  appears  on the screen  here uh you\\'ve  got warnings  on the left \\nhand side you can even change what\\'s on the display here so if we go down to layout we\\'ve currently  \\ngot that sort of center  one dial setup  you can get a two dial setup  back  in the day when  you had speedo  \\nin a rev uh gauge as well or you can go the full map display as well so look it\\'s a good setup i just think  \\nit\\'s probably a little bit dated this could do with a really nice refresh to bring it in line with what bmw audi  \\nand those guys are actually doing with their displays at the moment in addition to that you have a  \\nhead -up display ahead of the driver all basic information there you get something you nav details  \\nspeedo and also traffic sign recognition as well now safety technology you\\'ve got autonomous  \\nemergency braking you have rear cross traffic alert you have a blind spot monitor built into that wing  \\nmirror you have a lane departure warning radar cruise control and a lane keeping assistant when it  \\ncomes to parking you have front and rear parking sensors and a 360 camera i\\'ll show you what the  \\ncamera  looks  like so there it is there  it\\'s actually  a really  high quality  camera  and then you can move  the \\nviews around as part of that 360 view or you can come over here and manually select the view as you  \\ngo so yeah not a bad setup there i like the way that they\\'ve integrated that and i don\\'t know look kind of  \\nfun as well at the same time hey by the way if you do want more information on the ipace we have uh  \\nfull review plus information on specification and pricing at the car expert website you can click up here  \\nto be taken t o the ipace showroom let\\'s move on to practicality and we\\'ll start off with your connectivity  \\nso you\\'ve got one usb a port down here inside the center console you have a usb c port another usb a  \\nport and a 12 volt outlet there is also a port here for your nano sim now it\\'s a little bit confusing but the  \\ncar comes  with an embedded  sim you then need  to add your own sim card to get connectivity  to the car \\nremotely  so a little bit confusing  i don\\'t  understand  whether  i just have  both of those  operating  under  the \\nones sim but it is the way that it is on the phone front where you\\'re going to pop that well you\\'ve got  \\nwireless phone charging down the front here your phone can then live in a variety of other places as  \\nwell so it\\'s pretty straightforward there what about your coffee cup so good news there is a deep hole  \\nthere if you do have american style coffee but if you have paul style coffee your coffee cup fits into  \\nthere without any dramas it\\'s easy to lift as well and then you have rubber teeth holding it into place so  \\ni\\'m sorry with the bottle you\\'ve got two tiers there so it\\'s not going to really move anywhere i love the  \\nway those  rubber  teeth  hold it into place  this then fits inside  the door no problems  there  we\\'ll see if a big \\nbottle fits yes it does look at that win -win on other storage you have the center console here look it\\'s  \\nreasonably sized it\\'s actually quite deep and then it goes under here as well so you\\'ve got stacks of  \\nroom  in there  glove  box is not too bad as well that\\'s  quite  deep  you\\'ve  got this storage  space  down  here \\nif you\\'re not charging your phone and finally you have a sunglasses holder up the top in terms of your  \\ncomfort this is where you control your clima te control so it has dual zone automatic climate control so  \\n\\nyou control temperatures on here but that\\'s a pretty cool feature so you\\'ve got your screen down there  \\nyou press this button at the top and it\\'s called smart climate so it will only deploy air conditioning to the  \\npassengers that are in the car so if i turn that off i can then go over here and start setting individual  \\nclimate zones but then when it is switched on it just services the one passenger inside the car and then  \\nto turn on your seat heating you can push into there and then switch your seat heating on or your seat  \\ncooling  as required  so really  nice setup  and i love the way they\\'ve  integrated  all of that into that display  i \\nthink that feels really nice high end and premium now on the seats the seats are pretty  comfortable for  \\nlong distance drives they hug you in nicely too you can see the perforations on them here for that  \\ncooling and i do love the jaguar emblem there on the headrest i think that looks great so you have  \\nelectric seat adjustment for both the driver and front passenger you\\'ve got a number of adjustments  \\nhere so you can go forwards  backwards  backrest  can go forwards  backwards  seat can go up and down  \\nyou can adjust all of your bolsters there the front section as well you\\'ve got memory for the driver  and \\nfront passenger and that\\'s all part of an optional seat package that gives you all of those adjustments  \\nthen on the steering front you have both tilt and reach adjustment and on our reach test all of this stuff  \\nis easy to reach while you\\'re driving okay second row of the ipay so room not too bad there in terms of  \\nknee room toe room is pretty reasonable and head room is good i think if you\\'re a little taller you\\'re  \\nprobably going to be rubbing up against that but i\\'ll call this out this panoramic roof pretty sure it\\'s  \\noptional  but i think  it looks  fantastic  they even  integrated  the glass  around  this section  here so it goes  all \\nthe way behind your head and i think it is a really cool look and it\\'s naturally tinted as well so it doesn\\'t  \\nget too hot when you do have the sun beaming on it other creature comforts you\\'ve got map pockets in  \\nthe back of the seats these are your seat heater controls two usb c outlets down the bottom and a 12  \\nvolts outlet as well a little bit of storage there too you\\'ve got a center armrest here with two cupholders  \\nso bottle  fits into there  it\\'s got those  grip teeth  so it\\'ll hold it into position  nicely  and then the bottle  fits no \\nno it doesn\\'t the bottle doesn\\'t fit inside the doors i just don\\'t understand why you would make doors  \\nthat don\\'t fit bottles this is a pretty standard size bottle so a little bit disappointing there you have iso fix  \\npoints on the two outboard seats and top tether points as well look i think in terms of a family car this  \\nkind of meets that brief in terms of having enough room for the kids you\\'ve got air vents built into these  \\npillars and also the safe exit assistant so it\\'ll prevent you from opening the door if there is another  \\nvehicle or cyclist coming because kids are sometimes very eager to get outside th e car finally our  \\nwindow test see what happens there we\\'ll get that oh look at that almost all the way down just that little  \\nlip there but i am thankful it\\'s not like the bmw ix which stopped like here or something like that so yeah  \\nat least it goes most of the way down so cargo space because it\\'s a bespoke ev platform the cargo  \\nspace isn\\'t terrible so you have a little over 650 litres available here in the boot and that includes some  \\nunderfloor storage so you can store your cable here and a few other odds and ends likewise down the  \\nfront there and then you\\'ve got a tyre repair kit as well just in case you need it off to the sides you have  \\nsome hooks if you do want to tie some stuff down 12 volt outlet plus another hook you can deploy on  \\neither side show you what it looks like with our bags in there so laptop bag there and then our full -size \\nsuitcase so you can see there it kind of pretty much takes up most of that space and then what you can  \\nalso do is remove your cargo blind and once that\\'s out of the way w e can drop our second row as well  \\nand that increases space to a little under 1500 liters and there\\'s also just under 30 liters of storage  \\nspace under the front boot for things like cables now before we go for a drive i just want to run you  \\nthrough the charging so you have one charge port which is located here that includes ac and dc  \\ncharging so ac charging can occur in single phase up to 7.4 kilowatts while dc charging on the other  \\nhand works at up to 150 kilowatts and it peaks at around 105 kilowatts now t his is an interesting  \\nposition i really don\\'t like it on the taikan and here in the i -pace how your charger is on this part of the  \\ncar because some of the cables on those fast chargers don\\'t really reach all that well you\\'ve got to  \\ndrape it over the car really would prefer if this was right at the front or right at the back or perhaps on  \\nboth sides like it is in the thai cars so a little bit disappointing on that front also a little bit disappointing  \\nthat while other brands are now capable of doing up to ar ound that 250 kilowatt mark on a 350 charger  \\nthis is still capped at around the 100 kilowatt peak mark so really do wish this would charge a little bit  \\nfaster given the technology is out there so i\\'ve just hit the road in the i -pace now this is all -wheel drive  \\nthat means it has one motor on the front axle one motor on the rear axle and combined they produce  \\n294 kilowatts  of power  and 696 newton  meters  of torque  quite  precise  isn\\'t it and that\\'s  all mated  to a 90 \\n\\nkilowatt hour battery the actual usable capacity of that battery is a little over 80 kilowatt hours so that  \\ngives you an idea of how much range you come to expect and that\\'s around that kilometer mark  \\ndepending on the type of measurement you\\'re using to figure out range and this is the really confusing  \\nthing with evs we i guess it\\'s kind  of the same with internal combustion cars  whenever we quote range  \\nit it\\'s very uh i guess perfect conditions set up uh in these evs i always take like 100ks off the stated  \\nrange because you know you on days like today where it\\'s hot you want to run the air conditioner um  \\nthere\\'ll be other days when you\\'re driving uphill towards a destination that\\'ll use more battery or colder  \\ndays so it is just worth keeping in mind whenever you see range just lop 100ks off and that should be  \\nyour comfortable driving range jaguar has a combined electric economy of 23 kilowatt hours per 100ks  \\nwe are currently sitting on 21.9 so under that claim which i think is pretty damn impressive as a  \\nreference my model 3 performance sits at around 17 kilowatt hours per 100k which means it uses less  \\nelectricity to do 100 kilometres of driving now what does all that feel like behind the wheel and look i  \\nthink you\\'re probably getting a little bit bored of every single car reviewer in the world just going oh look  \\nit pins you back  in the seat and all that sort of stuff pretty  much  every  ev does  that and it\\'s an easy  party  \\ntrick because you know it\\'s an electric motor it takes talk instantly from a battery there really isn\\'t much  \\nscience to it what they\\'ve done well though in the eye pace is giving you the torque when you need it  \\nbut also smoothed it out when you don\\'t need it so as i gradually apply throttle it\\'s giving me enough  \\nmomentum there without sort of lumping me back into the seat whereas if i do step on it it really sort of  \\npicks up that pace and makes it all happen they\\'ve also done a great job with the regen as i roll out of  \\nthe throttle it\\'s quite a strong region it feels very much like a tesla in the way that it slows down the only  \\ndownside is it doesn\\'t come to a complete stop unless you\\'ve met a number of conditions  so right now  \\nwe\\'ve got a slight incline and it\\'s come to a complete stop and held it but in some situations it doesn\\'t  \\nactually come to a complete stop and it\\'s a little bit confusing why they have that feature if they haven\\'t  \\nyou know got a break that gets applied as the car gets slow enough so it is worth just keeping that in  \\nmind  and i think  they probably  need  to refine  that regen  feature  just a little bit one of the big advantages  \\nof the i -pace in comparison to its competitors is its total mass it weig hs a little over 2100 kilograms and  \\nthat is because  this sits on its own bespoke  ev platform  the 90 kilowatt  hour battery  gives  you that good  \\nbalance between i guess the range that you need but also it not being too heavy i think that\\'s why the  \\nbalance here is right and why the weight is so good as well some of the evs in this segment like the  \\nbmw  ix and especially  that top spec  model  weighing  it over two and a half tons which  is just huge  and at \\nthe end of the day yes battery capacity and battery power density will improve and make these lighter  \\nbut ultimately i think they need to do as much as they can to reduce the weight through the platform to \\nstart with so what\\'s the ride like now in the sc model air suspension and adaptive damping is optional  \\ni\\'m going to dial this up to the speed that we went through here in the ionic 5 which runs a similar setup  \\non the same wheel base so that is about 130 kilometers an hour and then we\\'ll run over these yeah  \\nokay so this is suffering the same thing that the ionic 5 had really just doesn\\'t have a great deal of body  \\ncontrol at that top end once you do hit those maximum highway speeds and that is because you don\\'t  \\nhave an adaptive damping setup so it is forced to just manage as much as it can on its own and as a  \\nresult of that it feels just a little bit floaty as it hits those consecutive bumps and they\\'re things that  \\nyou\\'re going to experience on country roads at these country speeds in some instances and what\\'s  \\nroad noise like it\\'s pretty good so we\\'re doing sort of around that 100 kilometer an hour mark now on a  \\ncountry road here and look there is some tyre noise coming into the cabin but it\\'s fairly civil i  can hear a  \\nlittle bit of wing noise about those wing mirrors but for the most part it\\'s not too bad right let\\'s put this  \\ninto sport mode so you\\'ve got your drive modes here and i\\'ll pop this down into dynamic we\\'ve got eco  \\ncomfort sport and ice but dynamics one i\\'m after let\\'s plow it through this corner that\\'s actually not too  \\nbad so it is soft in that sense that you can kind of predict what it\\'s going to do and as you start picking  \\nup the pace it actually feels really enjoyable at higher speeds when you hit those bumps it\\'s really soft  \\nand progressive you know exactly what it\\'s going to do it never really surprises you and in the sport  \\nmode that throttle becomes quite sensitive so you can actually really play with it and just give yourself  \\nthat push in the back whenever you want it uh let\\'s have a look here at this faster section look at our  \\nsweeper  coming  up yeah  the body  is actually  really  nicely  settled  i\\'m quite  surprised  by that it\\'s um yeah  \\nlook i thought this was probably going to be a little worse than it is given the ionic 5 felt really i guess  \\nway too floaty over these sections even here on these higher higher speed parts when you line up the  \\n\\nthrottle it just pulls along really nicely so yeah quite impressive and look it meets the brief of being a jag  \\nright jags are all about driving enjoyment and putting a smile on your face and this really ticks those  \\nboxes and just in terms of steering feel and brake pedal feel there\\'s a really good transition here  \\nbetween the regen and the mechanical braking system and likewise in sport mode there\\'s adequate  \\nfeedback through the steering wheel just to give you a sense that something is happening in the car s o \\nyou know if you are after a fun ev this definitely meets that briefing you don\\'t really need to spend  \\nmoney on the air suspension you know on these floatier bits it is a little sort of unsettling but for the  \\nmost part it\\'s actually quite enjoyable to drive jaguar claims a 0 -100 time of 4.8 seconds this is how it  \\nwent up against our stopwatch now what about your visibility so i can see clearly down the front there i  \\nthink the wing mirrors could be a little bit bigger so they are okay in terms of size but y ou kind of have  \\nstuff lost in them and you get blind spot monitoring built into those visibility out the back isn\\'t great it\\'s  \\nquite  a narrow  envelope  so you don\\'t  really  see a great  deal out of that and you\\'re  probably  not going  to \\nbe doing a great deal of off -riding i know this actually has quite an impressive waiting depth because  \\nbeing electric they can seal it all up and you can do a bit of light off -roading and at the launch we  \\nactually did some off -roading in these so they are capable for some light off -roading but ultimately  \\nyou\\'ve only got a ground clearance of about 140 millimeters to work with so it\\'s not a huge amount but  \\nin terms of low speed maneuvers turning circle comes in at just under 12 meters and the steering is  \\nnice and light in that comfort driving mode so the jaguar i -pace look despite it not feeling as fresh as  \\nsome of the evs in this segment it\\'s actually still a really enjoyable car to drive and it hits all the marks  \\nand ev needs it\\'s fairly efficient it has enough room inside and it looks different enough to the others  \\nwithout looking too outrageous so i do like that they\\'ve integrated pv pro so that is a big step forward  \\nfrom the last infotainment system which was dreadfully slow uh this on the other hand is i nstantly there  \\nit\\'s capable  of over-the-air updates  and similar  to what  tesla  is doing  you\\'re  getting  new features  as well \\nlike that alexa stuff that gets uploaded to the car and they don\\'t even know to do anything about it it just  \\nappears there materially overnight um now would i buy one well this is the problem right you\\'ve got so  \\nmany competitors in this segment now and they\\'re all offering a whole lot more i guess equipment look  \\nat something like the bmw ix for example at that same price bracket it actu ally is a big offering with i  \\nguess even more bells and whistles in terms of technology so you really do have to weigh up your  \\noptions  there  but if it is the drivers  ev that you want  the jaguar  really  is up there  in terms  of performance  \\nand putting a big smile on your face now let me know in the comments section below have you bought  \\nan ipace what\\'s it been like to live with there are really not that many on the road here in australia but i  \\nknow that some of you have bought them so let me know what the ownership experience is like in the  \\ncomments section below if you did

\\nCar Model: Jaguar 2022 I -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nrefreshing welcome back to car chat tv guys my name is oliver and in today\\'s episode i\\'m going to  \\nanswer the question that someone asked me they\\'ve asked me what is the best all -electric vehicle suv  \\nmoney can buy right now now on our channel you may have seen we\\'ve reviewed the utron 55 the  \\nskoda  enyak  the mustang  mark  e the list goes  on but today  i\\'m going  to tell you what  the best is are you \\nready sitting right in front of me i\\'m going to show you come on let\\'s have a look it\\'s the jaguar i -pace  \\n[Music]  ev400  let\\'s go for a walk around  first because  the styling  of this car is a little bit outlandish  isn\\'t it \\nit doesn\\'t really look like another jaguar that they produce and i like that it\\'s very different unique we\\'ve  \\ngot this gorgeous back we\\'re going to come to the back in a moment but this is the got a black exterior  \\npack on it so you\\'ve got black castle around the window trim it\\'s around 410 pounds it looks good the  \\nonly thing i\\'d probably do is i\\'ll get the black wheels on there as well come to the front we\\'ve got this  \\nshort  stubby  nose  now the grill brilliant  a lot of electric  vehicles  still have  problems  with the grill because  \\n\\nyou don\\'t  want  an electric  vehicle  to look like an electric  vehicle  you want  it to look like a normal  car and \\nthey have done such a great design job here because not only does this grill look great it flows up you  \\nget this kind of conveyor belt kind of style as it curves up through the car the air blows all the way  \\nthrough this vent which looks great may i add up the car down the back and through this spoiler now  \\nthe back we see here hasn\\'t got a rear windscreen wiper because the air just comes down through  the \\nspoiler and pushes off all the water let\\'s jump into the boot space because you might be thinking oh the  \\nstyling of the car might make it not that practical but you\\'d be wrong because you\\'ve got 577 litres of  \\nboot space back here more than enough to put loads of stuff in now put them seats back 1453 litres  \\ncables are out at the moment but look they\\'ve even designed a little cubby a little tunnel here for you to  \\nput your cables we\\'ve just been lazy and not put them back but i love that not all manufacturers have a  \\nplace for the cables we\\'ve seen that before so it\\'s a great design down quick have a look at this you  \\nmight be saying oh the sloping sport back design might restrict the space in the rear seats well loo k i\\'m \\nin i\\'m 511 and this is the hse trim so i\\'ve got a gorgeous  pano  roof to look up you know  what  headspace  \\nis good i\\'ve got room to move knee space is great as well so not much to worry about is there now i\\'m  \\ngoing to jump into the front into the driver\\'s seat and take this car out and tell you what it\\'s really all  \\nabout [Music] so i\\'m in the eye pace now and it is pouring down with rain so it\\'s pretty good too to test  \\nwhat  this is like in the pouring  rain so i\\'m going  to give you some  statistics  first now it\\'s an ev400  so that \\nmeans 400 fires are stark so 396 brake horsepower is what you get 696 newton meters of torque not to  \\n60 in 4.5 seconds yes i know that is exciting and we will test that in a moment it\\'s all -wheel drive you\\'ve  \\ngot a 90 kilowatt battery pack with a range of miles can you get that real world probably not so you\\'ve  \\ngot motors on the front and the back makes it all wheel drive now the only thing that\\'s probably quicker  \\nthan naught to 64.5 seconds you\\'re looking at tesla\\'s model s model three now the e -tron s actually can  \\ndo 4.3 which is a couple attempts off this but it\\'s a heavier car we have the e -tron 55 and it weighs 2  \\n500 kilograms now this is a lighter car still over two tons at 2208 kilograms so it\\'s a little bit more agile  \\nit\\'s a little bit nippier but i\\'m going to tell you three reasons why this is the best all -electric suv okay  \\nnumber one we spoke about the naught 60 4.5 seconds i\\'ve put it into dynamic mode what does 4.5  \\nseconds feel like this whoa you can feel that my head and  there we have it oh my gosh and when you  \\nput it in dynamic road everything goes red so you\\'ve got four modes you\\'ve got dynamic mode and the  \\nsteering\\'s great it\\'s really well balanced nice and stiff i can feel the car through the road i love that and  \\nthen the other modes will go for him now so you\\'ve got comfort steering lightens up a bit and the  \\nacceleration  on the pedal  isn\\'t as sensitive  and then you\\'ve  got you know  the eco mode  and the rain ice \\nand snow but i love that this has got another element adde d to it the dynamic mode is brilliant now we  \\nhave the e35 and that was really comfortable and it was a big car on the road this does not feel like an  \\nsuv it\\'s very saloon -esque the way you\\'re sitting but that raw power that\\'s something that i have not felt  \\napart from in the tesla and that\\'s why the performance that not 60 is at number one so number two has  \\nto be with the new 2022 upgrades to the i -pace you\\'ve got alexa now integrated and you can see it  \\ndown here on the infotainment 10 inch infotainment ther e and that\\'s fantastic yeah voice commands  \\nthey\\'ve been around for a while but any proper effective ones probably not and the fact we all have  \\nalexa\\'s  at home  you can be in your living  room  room  saying  oh alexa  what  range  do i have  left in my car \\nit will tell you alexa did i lock my eye pace it will tell you and switch that round you can be in your eye  \\npace driving home going alexa set my lounge to 22.5 degrees because that\\'s how i like it alexa turn my  \\nliving room light on because that\\'s how i like it that integration of alexa that jaguar have done in their  \\ninfotainment in their pv pro system is a touch of class and i\\'m a techie guy i really like it and that\\'s why  \\ni\\'ve included it now in this jaguar eye pace it is so well balanced you\\'ve got 50 50 weight distribution  \\nfrom front to rear and it\\'s so much fun when i was driving the econ 55 now i\\'m talking about that car as  \\nwell because there\\'s one we had recently and we did a review on we\\'ll put it somewhere and it was a  \\ncomfortable car but this has an added element the added element is it\\'s fun the steering is incredible i  \\ndo not feel i am in a big weighty  suv i apply  the brakes  they work  tremendously  as well i\\'m going  to take \\nthis around a few corners now just to show you because the body lean and roll is so minimal compared  \\nto that of other suvs in this category so the eqc mercedes you\\'ve got the bmw ix3 you\\'ve got the audi  \\ne-tron 55 and this the turning the steering of this car is it\\'s really rather good and would i say it\\'s as  \\ncomfortable as the e -tron 55 no i wouldn\\'t the utron 55 was brilliant with air suspension air suspension  \\nis an added option you can have in this car this is the hse specs you\\'ve got that nice pano roof and  \\n\\nwhatnot but this is better because you\\'ve got that comfort level the ride comfort isn\\'t that bad it\\'s  \\nminimal  the etron  55 year is comfortable  more  but it\\'s not going  to put you off this because  of the added  \\nelement of fun this drives so good it\\'s again i\\'ll say that word like saloon -esque i\\'m not as high up in the  \\ncar i\\'m still in dynamic mode i\\'ve got that performance when i was in the e25 and was put my foot down  \\nit wasn\\'t there immediately and in dynamic mode so the accelerator is a lot more sensitive b ut i know  \\ni\\'ve finished work i\\'ve jumped into my own pace i want to blow a little bit of steam off what do i do  \\ndynamic jab and it goes immediately it\\'s gone it\\'s gone it\\'s so good and it\\'s multifaceted and that\\'s why i  \\nlove the i -pace and my number three has to be the looks of this car it doesn\\'t look like other electric  \\nvehicles suvs out there and already in the rain i\\'m seeing dog walkers i\\'m seeing people and they\\'re  \\nlooking  at me and they\\'re  looking  at me going  hey that\\'s  a good  looking  car and they are right it looks  so \\ndifferent the big scoop in the vent for the air to flow visibility is great out the front the rear not so much  \\nbut then you remember you have got that that flowing sport back and with other manufacturers you  \\nhave  to pay for that sport  back  this is included  so all in all the look the appearance  the style of this car is \\nsomething really unique a little bit of vanguard and i think for those out there that want to have a  \\npremium suv all electric vehicle and want to be a little bit different then look no further than this so  \\nthey\\'re my three best things that i love about the car i\\'d love to know what your thoughts are and  \\nwhether you agree or disagree let me know in the comments below inside the car you\\'re looking for a  \\nluxury suv or electric vehicle the leather the materials are great this is some of the softest material i\\'ve  \\never touched on the dash i\\'m not gonna  lie and it flows over there and you  get different types of  \\nmaterial on there a little intricate design which  i really like now level on the door contrasting stitching  \\nbrilliant this is the hse you expect good equipment we\\'re going to throw back to adam because he\\'s in  \\nthe rear i want you to talk to me adam comfort and space go okay we\\'re talking about comfort and  \\nspace actually i think from the outside it doesn\\'t look very big so from the outside i feel like it looks fairly  \\nsmall like the same sort of size as like a i don\\'t know like a golf or something but really when you  \\nactually get in here you\\'ve actually got plenty of knee room let me show you so they\\'re my knees plenty  \\nof room and actually you can see the doors that side there\\'s actually quite a bit of room above f or your  \\nhead so i think i\\'d say it\\'s quite spacious i\\'ve also got a baby seat in here as well so you get a full a full  \\nlook at the back here um plenty of room for the cameras something i would say it\\'s really comfy yeah i  \\nwould say i\\'m pleasantly surprised awesome so it\\'s an all -electric suv vehicle it\\'s got regenerative  \\nbraking but what i love is you can just put it on high harvest as much energy back into that battery and  \\nthen when you turn off the car it will stay in that high mode where other electric v ehicles they forget and  \\nyou have  to re-configure  it where  every  time you get in the buttons  and the satisfaction  you get on some  \\nof these rotary dials are so good and it\\'s a pull and a push so if you push in you\\'ve got your electric  \\nseats and your cool seats you pull it out you can do your climate control and blower and whatnot but  \\nthey\\'re really good i do like a rotary uh wheel here so we need to talk a little bit about range jaguars say  \\nthat 292 miles is what this will get in real world terms i\\'m not so s ure that\\'s the case especially in the uk  \\nin cold february that\\'s chilly now charging this will take maximum 100 kilowatt charger good luck finding  \\nthem they are rare but if you do every 15 minutes you will add about 18 miles to your battery now in the  \\nupdated 2022 a really cool thing is on board charge is now 11 kilowatts it used to be 7 kilowatts so  \\nwhen you charge it at home in your wall box overnight it used to be 12.6 hours till full but now it\\'s 8.6 so  \\nyou\\'re  saving  yourself  four hours  well done  jaguar  good  upgrade  so say you\\'re  only finding  a 50 kilowatt  \\nthen all you need to look at then is every 15 minutes it\\'s around 40 miles added so all in all if you\\'re out  \\nand about and you need to charge fully it\\'s still gonna take just under an hour to get this baby back to  \\nfull charge  they have  updated  it war box is where  it\\'s at 11 kilowatts  get home  park up jab it in 8.6 hours  \\njobs done so in summary the jaguar eye pace is such a great all -rounder and then some because of  \\nthat performance 4.5 seconds not to 60. and the accelerator in dynamic mode is so responsive i love  \\nthat feeling i just i need to get ahead of this yeah and it helps me out i needed to get ahead someone\\'s  \\nparked there and we\\'ve looked at three cool reasons why we talked a little bit about the updates we\\'ve  \\ntalked about the charging as well now you can pick a new 2022 up for around 65 620 pounds so i want  \\nto know your thoughts what do you think have you agreed with me disagreed let me know everything  \\nthat\\'s going on through your mind right now in the comments below also with jaguar\\'s pvpro system th e \\ncameras are great quality it\\'s really hard to beat really if you look here we\\'ve got the camera set up and  \\nnow it is raining remember but if i click any one of these we get the simulations we can see different  \\n\\nelements of the car and it\\'s not showing it in its greatest light but the quality is there it is raining and it\\'s  \\njust a great feature to point out as well we just want to say a huge thank you to jaguar landrover  \\nnorthampton who have been really accommodating and super helpful so check them out so that has  \\nbeen our episode on the ipace we\\'ve even tested it in the rain for you look at today let\\'s do a summary  \\nwhat have we done i\\'ve told you my reasons why this is the best all -electric suv you can buy right now  \\ni\\'m sure you\\'ve got something to say about it i\\'ve showed you the practical side as well that  \\nperformance not to 64.5 seconds it\\'s so much fun let me know all your thoughts about the car in the  \\ncomments below t hrow me a like get subbed and i\\'ll see you on the next one [Music] you  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2023 I -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nwhen jaguar launched the i -pace back in 2018 it was one of the very first electric suvs to go on sale on  \\nthe market and it was ahead of its time four years later however the eevee landscape has completely  \\nchanged and the i -pace has a growing list of rivals to compete with this includes the audi e -tron ford  \\nmustang mackie  mercedes uqc  and volvo  xc40 recharge  to name  a few  in light of  increased  \\ncompetition jaguar has updated the i -pace for 2022 with faster charging updated tech inside and subtle  \\nstyling chang es to include a new black edition specification in ireland prices for the ipay start from  \\naround 75 000 euro and it has an electric range of up to 470 kilometers from a single charge in this  \\nvideo we\\'ll show you inside and outside the eye pace and tell you everything you need to know but  \\nbefore we start remember to check out carzone.edu to find jaguars for sale in ireland from trusted  \\nsellers even though the i -pace has been around for a few years now it is still one of the most distinctive  \\nlooking evs on th e market most recently jaguar has introduced a new black edition specification for the  \\ni-pace which updates the grille window surrounds door mirrors and badges to a black finish other black  \\nedition upgrades include a fixed panoramic roof a tailgate spoiler and premium led headlights as  \\nstandard the i -pace gets silver 19 -inch alloy wheels but the black edition gets larger 20 -inch glass black  \\nalloy wheels which are a nice upgrade jaguar has also added some new colours for the eye pace with  \\n10 colours to choos e from fuji white is standard while this eye -catching casein blue is an optional extra  \\nall eye-based  models  get a huge  90 kilowatt  hour battery  and also 100 kilowatt  dc charging  as standard  \\nstepping inside the jaguar i -pace feels suitably premium throughout as you would expect from an ev at  \\nthis price point the biggest change with the updated model is jaguar land rover\\'s new pivi pro  \\ninfotainment system which is similar to the system that\\'s used in the latest land rover defender this  \\nincludes a 10 inch touchscreen on the dashboard while higher spec models get another 5 inch  \\ntouchscreen here for the climate controls this one is a lower spec model so it doesn\\'t have the five inch  \\ntouchscreen her e however it does have lots of buttons in place for the climate controls wireless apple  \\ncarplay and android auto are both standard while this one has an upgraded meridian sound system  \\nwhich is a must -have for music lovers the touchscreen system is nice and it is good to use but it does  \\ntake some getting used to with lots of menus to navigate through especially when you\\'re driving like  \\nbefore there is also a 12.3 inch digital drivers display which shows all of your driving and eva  \\ninformation very clearly wi th these nice toggle switches on the steering wheel you can adjust the  \\ndifferent displays shown at all times when the ipads first launched through the market it had a very  \\nimpressive interior look and feel and this is still the case with the latest model overall fit and finish is  \\ngenerally premium throughout with lots of plush materials across the dashboard and doors the i -pace  \\nthat we\\'re testing here has light oyster  leather upholstery which is an 1100  euro optional extra when  \\nyou sit into the eye pace for  the first time it feels very spacious up front and the driving position is  \\ncomfortable with eight -way electric seat adjustment as standard and plenty of adjustment through the  \\nsteering wheel there\\'s lots of storage up front too with a large compartment underneath the driver\\'s  \\narmrest here two large cup holders which you can take out should you want to there\\'s a useful area  \\nhere for holding coins or for glasses which is what i use and also a useful tray for a smartphone there\\'s  \\nstorage for water bottles in the doors too while under the driver\\'s armrest you get a usbc charge point a  \\n\\nusb charge  point  a 12 volt socket  and up front there  is another  usb charge  point  the center  console  area \\nhas button controls for selecting park drive and reverse along with controls to adjust the ride height of  \\nthe car as this one has electronic air suspension which is a 1700 euro optional extra the i -pace is  \\nspacious in the rear seats too with good headroom for taller passengers good leg room and it is  \\narguably better than the bmw ix3 or mercedes eqc for rear seat comfort sitting into the middle seat  \\nhowever isn\\'t as comfortable this console area here restricts leg room slightly while the seat itself is  \\nquite  narrow this  black edition  model has  a full -length fixed  panoramic roof  which lets  light into the  \\ncabin and makes it feel bright and spacious back here there\\'s also useful storage trays underneath the  \\nseats along with helpful storage nets on the backs of the seats elsewhere there are two usbc charge  \\npoints a 12 -volt socket and also a large armrest with two cupholders built in it\\'s also good that this  \\nwhole section drops down easily if you want access to the boot or to carry larger items like skis there\\'s  \\nalso two sets of isofix mounts in the rear for family buyers but it is worth noting that the i -pace is only  \\navailable  with five seats  and it doesn\\'t  have  a seven -seat option  like you get with the tesla  model  x boot \\nspace in the eye pace is good with 656 liters of room it\\'s more than you get in the audi etron or the  \\nmercedes eqc drop the rear seats down and space increases to 1453 litres while the floor is flat which  \\nmakes it easy to slide large items in and out there\\'s also a useful storage area underneath th e floor for  \\nyour charge cables along with a 12 volt socket and hooks for storing your shopping bags in place  \\nthere\\'s also a small storage area underneath the bonnet which is useful for charge cables again but not  \\nmuch else the i -pace drives much the same as before with a huge 90 kilowatt -hour battery and two  \\nelectric motors one on the front axle and one on the rear axle with 400 horsepower and all -wheel drive  \\npower delivery is instantaneous not to 100 kilometers an hour takes just 4.5 seconds under hard  \\nacceleration what stands out when you drive the i -pace is the way it handles true corners it is very  \\nenjoyable to drive and it grips the road with confidence even though it weighs 2.2 tons it doesn\\'t feel  \\nheavy from behind the wheel with good steering feel and response it\\'s definitely one of the best evs for  \\ndriver enjoyment true corners it is much more convincing than the audi econ or the mercedes eqc the  \\ni-pace\\'s ride quality is good and it is very comfortable even on bumpier road surfaces and with the  \\nlarger 20 -inch wheels on this test car generally the i -pace is very comfortable and well suited to irish  \\nroads there is two different settings for regenerative braking high and low but you do have to adjust this  \\nthrough the touchscreen system where most other evs tend to have paddles behind the steering wheel  \\nfor adjusting it is also worth noting that rear visibility out of the cabin isn\\'t great due to the sm all sloping  \\nrear window that said the i -pace now gets a 360 degree around view monitor and a clear reversing  \\ncamera which reduces this issue somewhat new software means the ipace\\'s usable battery has  \\nincreased to 84 kilowatt hours and it has a claimed range of up to 470 kilometers from a charge which  \\nis more  than many  of its rivals  we achieved  closer  to 400 kilometers  of range  during  our test in cold and \\nwintry conditions averaging 21 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers of driving there are different driving  \\nmodes with eco comfort and sport but we found the eco mode offers sufficient power for most driving  \\nneeds the good news is that the new i -pace now has a three -phase 11 kilowatt on -board charger  \\nwhereas it previously had a single -phase 7 kilowatt on -board charger this means if you have an 11  \\nkilowatt ac home charger the i -pace can fully charge at 11 kilowatts in around nine hours overnight  \\nwhereas previously this would have taken around 13 hours in the old model in terms of rapid charging  \\nthe maximum  charge  speed  that the i-pace  can accept  is 100 kilowatts  so it will take around  40 minutes  \\nto charge up to 80 with a rapid 100 kilowatt dc charger while that\\'s good lots of the ipace\\'s rivals offer  \\nfaster  rapid  charging  speeds  of over 200 kilowatts  including  the tesla  model  y and even  more  affordable  \\nevs such as the kia ev6 and hyundai ioniq 5. that said there are still relatively few chargers in ireland  \\nthat can charge beyond 100 kilowatts with a more common 50 kilowatt dc charger the i -pace can  \\ncharge up to 80 percent in around 85 minutes this i -pace black edition also gets lots of safety tech as \\nstandard including traffic sign recognition with an adaptive speed limiter a driver condition monitor lane  \\nkeep assist and lots more in ireland the jaguar i -pace is available in four different specifications s black  \\nedition se and hse the black edition model that we\\'re driving here starts from 78 400 euro and it adds  \\nlots of desirable extras including the larger gloss black 20 -inch wheels premium led headlights 12 -way \\nelectric memory seats the black exterior design pack panoramic glass roof and lots more  if you want  \\neven more spec the se starts from 96 thousand euro while the range -topping hse model starts from a  \\nwhopping  103 000 euro so should  you buy the new jaguar  i-pace  well if you\\'re  looking  for a premium  ev \\n\\nthat offers good real -world range has a luxurious interior and one that is very good to drive to it is  \\ndefinitely one to consider that said it carries a high price tag especially in the higher specification  \\nmodels while some of its rivals offer faster rapid charging speeds overall the i -pace stands apart from  \\nmost other premium evs on the market right now in how it looks and how it drives and for that reason it  \\nremains one of the standout options check out carzone.edu to read our full written review of the new \\njaguar i -pace where you can also find jaguars for sale in ireland from trusted sellers  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2023 I -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nin 2018 there weren\\'t that many premium all -electric suvs and indeed the jaguar ipay stood out but in  \\n2022 we\\'re littered with options so in this review and seeing how it compares to its modern rivals and  \\nfurthermore if it\\'s actually worth its price tag because the i -pace starts from 65 000 pounds and with the  \\nhse trim that we have on review with the options fitted on top it comes in at a whopping 79 000 pounds  \\nif you\\'d like a detailed breakdown between the different trim levels and as to what you get as st andard  \\ndo check out our detailed written review it\\'ll be down description below now given its premium price tag  \\none might expect a luxurious exterior design and quite frankly i think jaguar have achieved it with the  \\ni-pace see from the front it\\'s got that kind of aggressive look and it\\'s all somewhat reminiscent to the xj  \\n220 whereby it\\'s flared sort of bonnet and wings give it that sort of sportier edge as for its side profile  \\nyou\\'re treated with 18 to 22 inch alloys which you can choose from and the body colored wheel arches  \\nand side skirts give it that sort of premium extra feel speaking of which here you\\'ve also got door  \\nhandles which are concealed within the frame of the vehicle and prop open when the car is unloc ked a  \\nsmall little touch but one is definitely appreciated as for the rear profile of the vehicle you\\'ve got that  \\njaguar -esque finish from its tail light designed to yet again this aggressive sort of look specifically given  \\nthe fact that it\\'s got that integrated spoiler at the top of the vehicle now as we transition inside the cabin  \\nthe vehicle still oozes class with a choice of materials around the dashboard to the seat upholstery and  \\neven the door frames everything just looks to part at least subjectively  now what takes center stage is  \\nthe actual technology implementation in the 2022 model of the i -pace here you\\'ve got a 10 -inch display  \\nwhich supports android auto and apple carplay both in a wired and wireless format now other than the  \\nthird-party operating systems i should also mention that the menu layout of the ipays is a little bit  \\nconvoluted it takes a little while when you\\'re transitioning between certain menus and for example the  \\nregenerative braking selection can\\'t be quickly accessed through the st eering wheel or via button you\\'ll  \\njust have to faff around with the vehicle settings which i just don\\'t find as intuitive as some of its rivals  \\nnevertheless if you go for one of the more premium trims what you\\'ll find is a secondary 5 -inch display  \\nthis is dedicated for climate controls and i think it does exactly what it says on the tin if you do want this  \\non the standard level trim you\\'ll have to pay around 410 pounds now what i do like around this area is  \\nthe fact that jaguar has integrated a multi -functi onal rotary dials both for the passenger side and the  \\ndriver side allows you to adjust the fan speed the climate controls and of course to play around with the  \\nheated seats which come as standard in every level trim it just makes the usability and the functionality  \\nof it far superior than some of its rivals that opt for a fully digitalized input instead and well it\\'s certainly  \\nappreciated to keep the kind of retro design in this aspect now on the subject of its climate controls i  \\nshould mention that the pm 2.5 filter comes in at an additional 150 pounds and similarly if you want the  \\nwireless charging pad for your smartphone which can be found just underneath the climate control  \\nsettings you will have to pay an additional 305 pounds which frankly i think is ridiculous given that the  \\noverall  asking  price  of the vehicle  now what  does  come  as standard  on the plus side is a fully digitalized  \\ninstrument cluster and here the 12.3 inch display gives you all the right information that you re quire and  \\ncan be customized to a very certain degree but is nowhere near in terms of the level of customization  \\nthat you can find in the likes of let\\'s say the audi or volvo alternatives now before we transition off the  \\nuse of technology i should also reference the audio system and for those who are subscribed you\\'ll  \\nknow i do dedicated audio reviews of every vehicle i get in and indeed there\\'s one for the jaguar eye  \\n\\npace it\\'ll be up on your banner down description below or indeed in the pinned comments now as  \\nstandard in the s and se trims you\\'ll get the meridian audio system that outputs 400 watts and has 12  \\nspeakers which also includes a subwoofer if however you want to upgrade to the 3d audio system from  \\nmeridian you\\'ll have to shell out 610 pounds in the hse trim however this comes as standard and it will  \\ngive you 17 speakers that output up to 750 watts as mentioned do check out the dedicated audio  \\nreviews for a lo t more details about this but what i will say in a nutshell is that i was expecting a little bit  \\nmore from the most premium meridian audio system within the jaguar eye pace so now we get on to  \\nstorage  and first off let\\'s talk about  what  you get within  the cabin  now at the front you\\'ve  got a small  little \\nsunglass compartment which i find quite handy and is very similar to what you\\'d find in other land rover  \\nvehicles and then you\\'ve got the glove compartment as for the door bins the front two are large enough  \\nfor a 500 milliliter bottle to fit alongside smaller valuables while the rear two are a little bit more limited  \\ntowards  the center  console  i did previously  reference  the wireless  charging  pad of course  if you don\\'t  go \\nfor this option you\\'ll have a non -slip bay instead which is large enough for a small s ize or large size  \\nsmartphone further down you\\'ve got a little area where it allows you to prop for your phone upwards  \\nvertically or horizontally or if you do wish to place your key fob or some pens over here it\\'s a small little  \\nhandy storage further down you\\'ve got two cup holders and then you\\'ve got the center armrest  \\ncompartment which might not seem large at first but it\\'s not until you open it up that you\\'ll realize that  \\nyou can easily fit a medium to large size purse and or a wallet among size some othe r valuables such  \\nas let\\'s say some  sunglasses  or a small  size bottle  over here you\\'ll  also find a 12 volt socket  should  you \\nwant  to plug in let\\'s say a dash  cam our favorite  round  up will be down  description  below  where  you can \\nfind some of the best dash cams on the market and then elsewhere you\\'ve got a usb type -c and type -a \\nports  which  are useful  for connecting  up to the infotainment  system  via a wired  format  now of course  as \\nfar as storage is concerned there is boot capacity now in the se and the hse model you have got a  \\npower tailgate that is fitted as standard and unfortunately that isn\\'t as standard in the regular s model  \\nwhich  is quite  a shame  given  the fact that the vehicle  starts  from 65 000 pounds  nevertheless  in the hse \\nmodel that we have on review it can be operated by pressing a button just above the number plate  \\nwhen it\\'s a little bit dirty you can get your hands a little bit mucky but on the plus side you can operat e it \\nvia the included remote or via button found within the cabin now when it does open up you have got a  \\ngreat sort of design at least subjectively i\\'m just under six foot and i can fit underneath the boot lid and  \\nmeans that i can just fit in goods in and out without any problem speaking of which you do not have a  \\nraised boot lip which makes it even easier and furthermore be it with a 60 40 or a 40 20 40 split which  \\nyou can add in as an additional option it means that loading goods specifically elongated o nes is a  \\nbreeze now elsewhere you do have a flat loading bay making it all that bit more convenient and  \\nfurthermore to store away your charging cables you can conceal them within the underfloor  \\ncompartment storage which is fitted as standard in every level trim in the jaguar eye pace now as for  \\ntotal capacity you\\'ve got a whopping 656 liters to play around with and with the seats propped down  \\nyou\\'ve got 1 1453 liters that makes it better than a lot of its rivals although not as large as the skoda  \\nenyak iv o r the larger ldetron now in the jaguar eye pace you do also have a frontal storage  \\ncompartment although it\\'s quite limited and therefore allows you to store maybe one or two shopping  \\nbags at most or for example your charging cables the only thing to note over here is that it\\'s not  \\nelectronically operated and as a result makes it a little less convenient if you\\'re frequenting it now  \\ndespite its somewhat compact look from the exterior of the vehicle the interior of the cabin is actually  \\npretty spacious i\\'m ju st under six foot and i\\'ve got no issues when it comes to headroom at the rear or  \\nat the front of the cabin and similarly when it comes to leg room the only thing to bear in mind is that if  \\nyou do have very long legs and you\\'re sat at the rear is that due to the kind of diagonally wedged rear  \\nseats it means that your quads muscles or hamstrings might get a little bit tired now if you\\'re not going  \\nto use the rear middle seat you can pull it down in other words to reveal an armrest or of course you\\'ve  \\ngot two cup holders as for convenience you\\'ve also got a 12 volt socket for charging at the rear of the  \\ncenter console and then two usb type -c ports as well now the front of the cabin you have heated front  \\nseats that come as standard in  all trim levels you\\'ve also  got an eight -way semi -electronically  \\nadjustable front seat in the s -trim now in the sc trim this moves up to a 12 -way electric controls and in  \\nthe hse trim you\\'ve got 16 -way electronic controls plus heated and cooled seats which is definitely  \\nuseful on hotter summer days now speaking of which here in terms of the sun that you might be getting  \\n\\nin certain countries here the glass panoramic roof isn\\'t fitted as standard it comes in at around 995  \\npound  option  no matter  which  trim level you go for which  is quite  a shame  because  i would  have  liked to \\nsee it as standard specifically in the most expensive hse trim and so now we get onto driving and first  \\noff i have to talk about visibility and here at the front and at the side of the cabin i\\'ve got no issues  \\nwhatsoever it\\'s easy to peer over the relatively short bonnet and as for the side the way that j aguar  \\nhave designed the a -pillars and the front windows makes it easy to check over my blind spot or for  \\nexample when i\\'m taking corners let\\'s say around a roundabout makes it easy to see let\\'s say if there\\'s  \\na cyclist approaching now the same couldn\\'t be quite said about the rear view window because it\\'s a lot  \\nmore limited in terms of visibility furthermore when it is dirty or for example it\\'s raining and you\\'re not  \\ngoing at speed and therefore utilizing the aerodynamics of the vehicle it means that well t he rear view  \\nwindow does get dirty and or is a little bit harder to see past now thankfully jaguar have integrated a  \\nrear view camera  as standard  and therefore gives  you a  bit more  peace of mind  when you  are \\nreversing so with visibility out of the way what about when it comes to driving comfort well here as  \\nstandard the jaguar i -pace comes with a passive suspension setup if however you want to go for the  \\nadaptive electric suspension then you\\'ll have to dish out an additional 1120 pounds and that\\'s exactly  \\nwhat we have fitted on the model on review now what i will say here is despite the adaptive suspension  \\npresumably  doing  a better  job than the passive  suspension  setup  it\\'s still a little bit stiff specifically  if you \\ncompare it to the likes of the larger audi e -tron suv it\\'s nowhere near as soft when you\\'re g oing over  \\npotholes rougher terrain or let\\'s say speed bumps here the jaguar eye pace is a bit more likened to the  \\nlikes of the vw id4 the skoda enyak iv the likes of the volvo xc40 recharge twin pro and is arguably a  \\nlittle bit softer  in comparison  to the bmw  ix3 and the mercedes  eqa now having  just referenced  the bmw  \\nix3 this perfectly leads me on to the overall driver\\'s feel of the jaguar i -pace and here it\\'s got a fantastic  \\nsearing input a responsive accelerator pedal at least when you are on the dynamic  driving mode  \\nbecause here the normal and eco modes will make it a lot mushier and doesn\\'t give you that same sort  \\nof one -to-one driving aspect and furthermore the driving position that you get in the jaguar i -pace  \\nmakes it almost feel like i\\'m driving a saloon it is almost comparable to the likes of the polestar 2 the  \\naudi e -tron gt or the likes of the tesla model 3. it doesn\\'t make me feel like i\\'m driving a slightly higher  \\nrise vehicle and jaguar should really be commended for that and this makes it well quite fun to drive  \\nspecifically  if you\\'re  taking  it on windy  country  roads  now similarly  it\\'s pretty  rapid  if you were  to put your \\nfoot down to the metal because i had it tested from 0 to 60 miles an hour in 4.8 se conds and while this  \\nisn\\'t as rapid as the likes of the volvo xc40 recharge twin pro nordy quoted claims from jaguar itself  \\nwhich claimed that the vehicle will get to naught to 60 in 4.5 seconds i think it will definitely suffice for a  \\nlot of consumers  now this is thanks  to the jaguar  i-pace  operating  on a dual motor  configuration  and this \\nalso means that it\\'s got an all -wheel drive system that\\'s in always an operation giving you again a little  \\nbit of extra know -how and a bit more extra confidence when you are driving around lit more slippery  \\nroads now combined the two motors output 294 kilowatts of power which equates to 390 horsepower  \\nand this also means that you got 696 newton meters of readily available torque and just in case you\\'re  \\nwondering top speed  is limited  to 124  miles an  hour which  will suffice  for most  individuals specifically  \\nfor those of us who live in the uk but if you want unrestricted roads and therefore you have the ability to  \\ngo well pretty much unlimited then you might be left a little bit disappointed by the overall top speed of  \\nthe jaguar  i-pace now  while its performance  traits are  pretty impressive  i was  very much  intrigued to  \\nsee how well it would do when it comes to range and this is because jaguar have integrated a large 90  \\nkilowatt hour battery pack which is among one of the largest that one can find in an all -electric suv and  \\nhere i was actually somewhat surprised to find it not actually achieve a higher amount of mileage see it  \\ndoesn\\'t seem to be as efficient as some of its newer competitors which house a much smaller battery  \\npack nevertheless here in comparison to the roughly 270 to 280 mile claim that the man ufacturer has i  \\nactually attained 240 to 250 miles from my mixed driving test which makes it on par with the likes of the  \\nvolvo xc40 recharge twin pro slightly better than the likes of the mercedes eqa and a lot better than the  \\nlarger audi e -tron suv however in comparison to the likes of the audi q4 e -tron the vw id4 the skoda  \\nenyak  iv the likes of the kia niro the hyundai  kona  electric  the kia soul av it is not as good  whereby  most  \\nof these vehicles achieve north of 260 miles at least according to my own mixed driving tests suffice to  \\nsay that the jaguar i -pace will definitely suffice when it comes to range but it\\'s not exactly class -leading  \\ndespite its housing a relatively large sized battery pack now for you to retain energy back into the  \\n\\nbattery packs you can of course use redemptive braking where one can attain it by pressing down on  \\nthe physical brake pedal and of course given it\\'s an electric vehicle you can lift off the accelerator pedal  \\nand therefore let the jaguar i -pace automatically decelerate now there are two modes to choose from  \\nwhere you\\'ve got low and high and even in its highest mode i don\\'t think it\\'s harsh enough to really give  \\nyou that one pedal driving approach now yes the ipas can be brought to a complete standstill by ju st \\nsimply lifting off the accelerator pedal but you\\'ll need a significant amount of distance so much so that  \\nyou\\'re probably going to resort and using the physical brake pedal here what i\\'m trying to say is that in  \\ncomparison to the likes of let\\'s say the volvo xc40 recharge twin pro which truly gives you a good one  \\npedal driving approach the same could be said about the jaguar i -pace it is still a little bit harsher in  \\nterms of regenerative braking in person to its volkswagen counterparts such as for examp le from aldi  \\nvolkswagen or even skoda where they integrate around 0.3 gs of deceleration whereas the jaguar  \\ni-pace integrates around 0.4 g\\'s of deceleration making it a little bit better when it comes to lifting off  \\nyour accelerator pedal and therefore really coming to a complete standstill now of course being an  \\nelectric vehicle you can plug it in and here the type 2 and ccs ports are found towards the front wing on  \\nthe passenger side now the ccs port will give you up to a hundred kilowatts of input meaning that you  \\ncan go from zero to eighty percent in around 45 minutes should you find a more commonly found 50  \\nkilowatt input it will take around one and a half hours now the new jaguar i -pace has a 11 kilowatt  \\non-board charger and therefore if you have access to a three -phase power supply it will take around  \\neight and a half hours to go from zero to one hundred percent if you go for a seven kilowatt input and  \\ntherefore don\\'t have three phase power supply it will take roughly 12 to 13 hours and by the way if  \\nyou\\'re going for a three pin input it\\'ll take over 30 hours to go from empty to full now finally when it  \\ncomes to the driver assistance systems the jaguar ipay seems to be a little bit strived for standardized  \\nfeatures see you will get cruise control lane assist and the traffic sign recognition system among a free  \\nother basic features that one might expect in a modern vehicle but nothing else if you want the lane  \\npositioning assistant and therefore steering assist you want adaptive cruise control blind spot  \\nmonitoring system the rear cross traffic alert among a few other features you\\'re going to have to pay an  \\nadditional premium which in my opinion isn\\'t quite justified given the fact that we are spending over 7 0 \\n000 pounds on the jaguar i -pace and so this brings me on to my verdict can i see myself actively  \\nrecommending the jaguar i -pace in 2022 well there are some alternatives that you should really  \\nconsider the volvo xc40 recharge twin pro offers pretty much the same sort of package as the i -pace  \\nexcept it comes in at 50 000 pounds the audi q4 e -tron doesn\\'t have the same sort of driving dynamics  \\nas the volvo or the jaguar but comes in at 45 000 pounds while offering the same sort of premium  \\ninterior feel and f urther more better range speaking of which if you want even more range the skoda  \\nenyak iv offers that and also gives you better boot capacity look past these vehicles and you want  \\nbetter driving dynamics you\\'ve got the bmw ix3 which also coincidentally also comes in cheaper than  \\nthe i-pace elsewhere past the premium badges as one might say you\\'ve got the hyundai koner electric  \\nthe kia soul ev and the ki nero all of which offer a compelling package that one might want to consider  \\nat roughly 32 to around 45 0 00 pounds now of course that\\'s just our subjective opinion and we\\'d be  \\nintrigued to hear your thoughts in the comments section below as to if and why you\\'d pick the jaguar  \\ni-pace over its rivals which fundamentally we think is just a bit too expensive to actively recommend  \\nnow if you\\'ve liked this detailed independent review we\\'d very much appreciate you dropping a like  \\nsubscribing  and hitting  that bell notification  if you haven\\'t  already  as such  i\\'ve been  chris  from toaster.ev  \\nand i\\'ll hopefully see you in the next one take care of yourselves and goodbye  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2023 I -Pace  \\nReview:  \\neveryone thanks for joining me this is a review of the 2023 Jaguar i -pace I bet many of you guys  \\nforgotten  about  this car or probably  didn\\'t  know  that this car was full electric  on a full charge  this car can \\nactually go 293 miles underneath the hood is an open trunk but you\\'re looking at 394 horsepower 512  \\n\\npound -feet of torque let\\'s go ahead and take a closer look at the vehicle now underneath the hood will  \\nbe Jaguar like I talked about your typical latch lift it up it\\'s held by Hydraulics you need a little storage  \\ncompartment that\\'s pretty much it along with your charging cords closing the hood I\\'m sure you\\'re  \\nseeing this huge hood scoop what\\'s actually really cool about it is if you look at the Grille it actually  \\nswoops air in through out from the hood that actually helps with aerodynamic efficiency along with your  \\nlittle ear skirts on the side here which helps for brake Cooling and if I grab the keys I\\'ll lock it there\\'s  \\nyour signature  daytime  running  lights  so of course  you do have  full LED and as well as your turn signals  \\nif I go ahead and lock that there you go coming off to the wheels these are beautiful optional 22 inch  \\nglass black wheels riding on 255 wood tires 40 series sidewall of course you do have your little charge  \\nport door here you can see Power forwarding mirrors flush door handles have you guys didn\\'t unlike it  \\nkind of Falls open for y\\'all here\\'s a look at the rear the Fastback roof that\\'s pretty sleek and then you do  \\nhave the LED tail lights if you can see there everything\\'s blacked out eyepiece Jagu ar badge and of  \\ncourse there\\'s no exposed exhaust tip kind of looks really Beefy from the rear if you look at that it\\'s  \\npretty sweet let\\'s go ahead and take a look inside the interior as we hop into the interior take a look at  \\nthe door first you have tons of soft touch leather padding a metal speaker Meridian surround sound  \\nsystem and then you do have memory seating you have your contrasting stitching here no special LED  \\nlighting  that I noticed  when  I did a video  last night  on it but you do have  contrasting  stitching  on the seat \\nthey look really nice quite a few waste power adjustable heated and cooled seats as well hopping on in  \\nyou are greeted with a fully digital display headset display a 10 inch pivy pro display and then the little  \\nscreen down here is for specifically for climate controls and you\\'re agreed with the push button for your  \\ngear selectors you have a push button stop start for an electric vehicle so it kind of makes it feel  \\ntraditional coming down here you have a wireless phone charg ing pad does pass through you get a  \\nlittle pass -through all the way down here too now these systems are pretty much jlr uh current system  \\nso I won\\'t go fully in depth with it but it\\'s very customizable as you\\'ve seen here this is the pivypro so it  \\ndoes have wireless carplay over the year updates and then Wireless Android auto too the dash itself I  \\nkind of noticed as soon as I hop in kind of goes out really really far so just keep that in mind nothing  \\nspecial up here other than a frameless rear view mirror a nd you are greeted with a nice open  \\npanoramic roof and that is pretty much it with the interior cup holders storage down here that\\'s pretty  \\nmuch all that is one thing is that this i -pace or at least first seen an electric vehicle I\\'ve not seen it  \\nanywhere else is adjustable air suspension and then your drive modes are here but yeah that\\'s pretty  \\nmuch it for the Jaguar the cabin feels really nice I\\'m actually really liking this ipace first time I\\'ve been in  \\none let\\'s go ahead  and turn off the vehicle  run out take a look at the rears  now one thing  I noticed  when  \\nhopping in and out is that fish right here comes it\\'s like design weird where I have to kind of swoop in  \\nand it makes  it feel you know  struggle  a little bit uh just for myself  now nicely  leather  padded  all over the \\nseats this is a trison climate control system you do have heated rear seats I believe cooling seats are  \\nnot an option but the dials with jlr if you notice that it looks like it has it but it doesn\\'t actually have it if  \\nyou have a pretty big hump or it\\'s small but my leg space down here I kind of notice I struggle to move  \\naround so just keep that in mind but yeah hopping out I definitely hit this all the time maybe just  \\nbecause of the design of the door if you look at it then the door mat erials back here just kind of follow  \\nthrough from the front which is nice if I didn\\'t show you already this is the Fastback roof let\\'s go ahead  \\nand open up the trunk of the eyepiece this is all your storage you have a cargo cover and then that is  \\npretty much it let\\'s go ahead and close it and then we\\'ll get to pricing turning to the end of the video  \\nhere this Jaguar ipace was priced at 78 000 this color was finishing very easy red I personally think if  \\nyou\\'re in the market for an electric vehicle 293 miles of range is pretty decent for where we\\'re at right  \\nnow and I think the i -pace is worth a look let me know what you think Down Below in the comments if  \\nyou liked the video like it if you want to see more subscribe thanks  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2023 I -Pace  \\nReview:  \\n\\nwelcome to this week\\'s road test review on auto EV you\\'re probably wondering why I\\'ve got the Jaguar  \\neyepiece  here because  it\\'s not new in fact in terms  of EVS it\\'s almost  pensionable  the car was launched  \\nin 2018 and it was two years into its law after its launch in 2020 when we first did our first road test  \\nreview and we also pitched it against the ev6 from Kia last year as a used car so why have you clicked  \\non this video to see a road test review on a car that\\'s five years old this isn\\'t even a face lifted one  \\nthere\\'s going to be a face -lifted car this year at some point a 2024 model this isn\\'t it so it\\'s not some  \\nsecret first Glimpse that we\\'ve managed to get hold of from Jaguar this is the same eyepiece that \\nyou\\'ve been able to buy since 2018. but the reason that I wanted to do a rotation view in this car was  \\nvery very simple  you see up until now I\\'ve always  said that it\\'s my money  no object  TV I think  this is one \\nof the best EVS you can buy in fact up to the point Porsche launched the taikon cross Turismo this  \\nwould  have  been  my choice  and the thing  with the Jaguar  IP says because  it\\'s now five years  old as we \\nknow the EV world moves very fast back in 2018 when it was launched there really wasn\\'t a lot of  \\ncompetition out there I mean Audi was just a break to bring out the e -tron and Mercedes with the same  \\nwith the eqc 400 but it still wasn\\'t quite there yet but now there is a huge amount of competition and GI  \\ngilhov well shall we say they\\'re kind of standing still a little bit so I wanted to know if the eyepiece is still  \\nworthy  of your consideration  five years  after its launch  in the face of much  near competition  and do I still \\nhold it in such high regard well there was only one way to do that and that was to bring on a road trip to  \\nScotland so welcome to Scotland welcome to the old Jagger eyepiece and as always welcome to Otto  \\nEvie foreign [Applause] [Music] before we get started on this week\\'s road test review of the old Jaguar  \\ni-pace it is of course that time for I\\'m going to ask you to make sure you\\'re subscribed to the O2 EV  \\nChannel  then once  you\\'ve  done  that press  the little bell button  that\\'s  down  below  because  then that way \\nyou\\'ll  be notified  of when  our next video  is uploaded  and goes  live once  you\\'ve  watched  the video  If you \\ndo enjoy it make sure you give a thumbs up and as always the comment section down below let us  \\nknow what your thoughts on the channel and of course on the course that we review do you have a  \\nJaguar eyepiece what\\'s your thoughts on it what\\'s your experiences with it are you looking perhaps at  \\nthis place in the market space and have you been considering a knife piece and want to know a bit \\nmore about it well as always do let us know down in the comments so why have I brought a jacket  \\ni-pace to Scotland well it\\'s as simple as this you see as I said it\\'s always been the car that I\\'ve said Is  \\nMy Kind Of Money No Object EV right up to the point the Porsche launched the Titan cross Jerusalem  \\nbut we were having a conversation in their EV office the other day and Rod said to me said is it still  \\nworthy of the consideration we know that the EV Market moves really quickly and with the eyepiece  \\nbeing five years old though is it still a card you would really consider in the face of competition such  as \\nthe new updated Audi Q8 e -tron Mercedes eqc 400 BMW IX and of course the taikon he said so why  \\ndon\\'t  you take one on a good  road trip and see if it\\'s still got that sprinkler  magic  see if it still tickles  your \\npickle like it used to so here we are back in Scotland to answer those questions is the eyepiece still  \\nworthy  of your consideration  but before  we move  on it\\'s probably  worthwhile  taking  a little snapshot  and \\nreminding ourselves of what the eyepiece actually is well as I say it was Jaguar\\'s first all -new electric  \\ncar launched back in 2018 and believe it or not despite its styling it is marketed as a mid -size premium  \\nSUV it has a wltp range  of just over 300 miles  and it\\'s at a price  point  from around  about  70 000 pounds  \\nall the way up to just over 90 000 pounds depending on depending on the specification and the trim  \\nlevel that you choose but here\\'s the thing should you choose it should you still be considering an  \\neyepiece  given  the fact that there\\'s  a huge  amount  of new competition  out there  well the only way we\\'re  \\ngoing to find out is we\\'re putting it through the road test the new card bars out they\\'ll actually trust when  \\nit comes to make a dec ision on your new EVs and that is of course the auto EV one well let\\'s kick off  \\nwith styling because well look at it why would you not I think this has to be Jaguar\\'s best looking car  \\nsince the original E -Type now Jaguar is a brand let\\'s just quickly give us a little bit of a history lesson  \\nwhen it comes to Jaguar because there was a time when there was just seen as a bit of an old man\\'s  \\ncar I think they thought that retro styling was the kind of way forward and it never used to be that way if  \\nyou look back  to the 1940s and 1950s the 1960s were cars such as the XK 120 the XK 140 XK 150 the  \\nE-Type the xj6 the xjs of 1970s and I don\\'t care what you say that is a real standout car that was way  \\nahead of its time and it was really much misunderstood the xjs and only now people are looking back  \\nthinking that\\'s a good looking car but to my eyes this is right up there with the E -Type is one of the best  \\nlooking cars that Jaguar has actually ever produced I think it\\'s an absolute stunning car and again a bit  \\n\\nlike I\\'ve always said if you can launch a car today that\\'s as old as this and it still looks fresh and it still  \\nlooks this good then its design is absolute on point and it\\'s a real classic I love the way the eyepiece  \\nlooks  I think  it\\'s the best look I think  it\\'s one of the best looking  cars on the road let alone  one of the best \\nlooking EVS not even just the best SUV look at it in column took away all that kind of retro styling and  \\nbrought the brand right up to date he\\'s kind of angry cold headlights where t hey can L sorry the  \\nj-shaped um drls running through there now the car does have a grill which is a bit odd because you  \\ndon\\'t need it but it was going to drag your signature now the new 2024 model car is going to have all  \\nthat filled in whereas here it\\'s a sort of mock Grille but there is a significant bit of styling here because  \\njust under there is an airflow sort of spoiler the airflow goes in there and comes out there the top of the  \\nBonnet  to give a real aerodynamic  shape  so that is important  that needs  to be there  and as I say it\\'s got \\nthe Jaguar face on it as well you\\'ve got extra cooling down at the bottom there and again some nice  \\nvents at the side that just take the airflow around the side of the wheels as well you\\'ve got your big Jag  \\nyour Growler matron in the middle there which is fantastic and as I see the whole thing just kind of  \\nhunkers down and whilst the front has a real presence about it it\\'s in the side profile where we really  \\nsee callum\\'s genius at work and it\\'s this line here you see it and  it runs up over the top of the wheel  \\nArch all the way along right to the back of the car this is a stunningly sexy looking car I make no  \\napologies for using that one so I\\'m sorry if it\\'s offended somebody look at the way this thing just curves  \\nover there and really hugs down that front wheel it looks like a cat ready to pounce obviously and then  \\nyou\\'ve got this lovely kind of swooping long roof line into this rear spoiler here the recessed door  \\nhandles that pop out when you open the car so its overall shap e is on fussy and really stylistic but it\\'s  \\nthe details as you go around it where you start to really see the best qualities of the design this little bit  \\ndown here the way these Lanes come along and then come up there and then mirrored up here you\\'ll  \\nsee that all around the rest of the car like in the rear light signature and the rear spoiler and it\\'s the way  \\nit\\'s that attention  to that detail  that I love about  this design  and as I say the market  as an SUV but I don\\'t  \\nthink  it is I don\\'t  know  how to describe  the eye Pace  really  because  it\\'s not a big tall high riding  thing  like \\na an IX BMW  IX it\\'s not really  an estate  car like the taikon  cross  Turismo  it\\'s just like a kind of big Sports  \\nhatch now you does have adaptive air suspension so you can actually raise the right height of the  \\neyepiece and it does have some more fraudibility because it is a dual motor car so therefore it\\'s  \\nall-wheel drive and but it\\'s not something you\\'d go plugging through sort of like you know the  \\nWilderness in like you may be wooden um you know something like you know so the Toyota bz4x or  \\nthe Subarus or Terra that we tested the other week but even so it\\'s certainly something you could see  \\nmaybe  with a nice set of winter  tires on taking  on a skiing  trip um or certainly  getting  you down  I kind of I \\ncan Farm track if you live at the end of it but the design of the whole thing just I just love this car so  \\nmuch the one thing I will add however you\\'ve got to have big wheels on it this is these are 22 inc h \\nAlloys on this car this particular test car anything smaller than that looks a little bit under tired in my  \\neyes and it\\'s one of those cars like a concept cars we see some of these ridiculously big wheels and  \\nthey never ever make production with them this is the one car that really does need the big wheels and  \\nit certainly doesn\\'t affect the ride and handling as we\\'ll see when we drive the car but let\\'s have a look  \\naround the back because the whole thing truncates into this lovely shot rear end look at th e rear  \\noverhang there there\\'s hardly any of it the wheels are pushed right out to this to the extremities of the  \\ncar which gives a real long wheelbase and really good cabin space and a car that\\'s actually quite short  \\noverall in comparison with cars as the BMW IX and the Audi e -tron so that\\'s probably helps give it that  \\nreal kind of compact nature and that can a real look there\\'s a tiny little bit of kind of plastic just there  \\nwhich is almost like a day again to help a little bit airflow into stop so the pai ntwork getting damaged by  \\nthose big wheels chucking up some bits of debris from it right the rear spoiler this is what I\\'m talking  \\nabout can you see that line there how it just kind of comes up and down and that\\'s the same just  \\nreminds  me of that little section  there  and these  rear lights  let me see if I can get these  to flash  because  \\nwhen they come on look there it is there again you see that\\'s that side cell section that bit there that\\'s  \\njust mirrored in that real light genius absolutely brilliant as I say it\\'s their attention to detail that stands  \\nthe card above  things  like the BMW  IX in my opinion  it\\'s just a wonderful  looking  car you\\'ve  got this little \\nkind of spoiler along here which is just put in the back just to add airflow there\\'s no rear wiper on it and  \\nthat does bug me um obviously because any car doesn\\'t have rear wiper does  annoy me but again like  \\nthe front what they\\'ve done is they\\'ve got a gap there so as the airflow comes over the roof it\\'s the  \\n\\nwhole  thing\\'s  designed  to take away  any excess  water  and kick it off now as I say I\\'ve driven  a car up to \\nScotland it was raining the other day when I came up hence the reason why I\\'ve washed the car um  \\ndoes it work sort of you do get sort of like little vortices kind of running down there to the water and as I  \\nsay it\\'s in the morning when you\\'re kind of driving out where you need that if it\\'s defrosted where you  \\njust want to give it a quick clear but we all know my thoughts on the lack of rear wipers and car so I  \\nwon\\'t labor it eyepiece badge there the big bold Jaguar leaper there with the jagged badge there a nd I \\nsee it\\'s low set number plate down here rear diffuser right down at the bottom no pretense to be an  \\noff-road on this car at all so there\\'s no big chunky wheel arches or any kind of four by four if that makes  \\nsense um it sort of like cladding or anything like that it\\'s just a neat pretty good looking piece of design  \\nin my opinion but what do you think if Jager launched this car today would it still turn your head is it still  \\nas good looking a car as it always was or am I completely wrong are there better looking cars out there  \\nas Ian Khan designed a better looking car than this if you take out the Aston Ma rtin Vanquish and db7  \\nas always let us know your thoughts in the comments section down below but yes it\\'s a slinky ship but  \\nthat doesn\\'t make it not practical this boot size is 557 liters as standard which makes it 57 liters bigger  \\nthan the BMW IX which is as you say I like the car but it is a big car but offers quite a small boot this is  \\nbigger um it\\'s got a um a 40 40 20 split on the rear seat as standard and that takes the boot size up to  \\n1453 liters and the O2 EV suitcases I don\\'t have with me because I \\'m up visit my mother and I don\\'t  \\nneed  a suitcase  so I didn\\'t  bring  them  so apologies  but they do all fit in there  because  I have  tried it and \\nboot space wise what other practicalities have we got well we\\'ve got little hooks at the side there just to  \\nhang bags of sharpening you\\'ve got some good chromed tie -down lashings there you know if you need  \\nto sort of put a netting down just to keep things hunkered down and you do get some good underfloor  \\nstorage for your cables as well and as well as that there is also a small space up at the front as well  \\nwhere you could put sort of like an additional cable and um or I don\\'t know like a muddy dog leader  \\nwhatever  you\\'ve  got with you that you need  to put in there  which  I\\'ll show  you too and solid original  rigid \\nparcel shelf um which is very good because it\\'s very secure but as I say because of that rear kind of  \\nsloping roof line and obviously with things like the the Privacy glass as well it\\'s all kept neat and out of  \\nthe way so yes a very practical car so up front there is a small space not huge it\\'s not tesla -like but it\\'s  \\nprobably  enough  as I say if you want  to put in an additional  charging  cable  um you make  a small  kind of \\nbag in there or oh I suppose if you\\'re out walking or something you had a a wet jelly or something like a  \\nwet jacket you could pop that in there or a wet dog lid or whatever so it\\'s probably just enough for what  \\nyou might need now rear seat accommodation okay it\\'s not as good as the BMW IX back in here so I  \\nwill give it that but it\\'s still ample it\\'s still a good place to be you\\'ve got a relatively flat four I mean it\\'s it\\'s  \\nbased on um excuse me based on a brand new platform or it was at the time of launch although it so it  \\ndoesn\\'t share it\\'s not a combustion engine platform that\\'s been modified it\\'s not like a an f -pace that\\'s  \\nbeen changed for it it\\'s not but you do have a slight raise there in the middle of the floor there so that\\'s  \\nthe only kind of down so it\\'s not a completely flat floor however the upside of that is it doesn\\'t feel that  \\nthe floor has been pushed up for the outer two passengers so you can actually get a really nice seating  \\nposition  and your legs are nicely  down  now the driver\\'s  seat set up for myself  and as you\\'ll  know  I\\'m five \\nfoot seven five feet eight excuse me and I\\'ve got plenty of legroom back here um even a middle  \\npassenger would be quite comfortable sat in the middle there because the seat is relatively flat across  \\nthe back um isofix points nice and easy to get to they\\'re covered on the outer two seats um and we\\'ve  \\ngot relatively good storage so you\\'ve got the seat pop them the Nets back in there we\\'ve got rear  \\nclimate control on this particular specification c ar and with you know something fan speed and  \\ndirectional  um uh adjustment  there  and then of course  you\\'ve  got connectivity  ports  down  there  you two \\nUSB ports  and a 12 volt socket  as well so that\\'s  all good  there\\'s  door bins although  they\\'re  not huge  but \\nyou probably could fit like a child\\'s water bottle in but probably not my big one and you\\'ve got that  \\nfolding armrest down in the center with an additional two cup holders and as I say that middle section  \\nthat 20 bit there the 40 40 20 will fall down as well so if you\\'ve got longer loads like skis or fishing rods  \\nor whatever you want to get through then you certainly can so as I say it\\'s not bad back here  \\nheadroom\\'s good I think if you were taller than me at six foot you\\'d start to feel a little bit more en closed  \\nin on a side bit but this massive big glass roof that the car comes with and just lets the carbon flood in  \\nwith light it is an option and it depends on the spec you have and we\\'ll go through that pricing but it  \\ndoes  it is something  I probably  would  have if  I was  looking  at an  eyepiece because  I see it  just lets  a lot \\n\\nmore light into the car it doesn\\'t open it just gives it this lovely big glass roof across the whole ceiling of  \\nthe car so yeah as I say it\\'s not the biggest in its class that\\'s probably going to go to things like The IX  \\nand the Audi e-tron but you certainly  do not feel shortchanged  if you had to do any type of Journey  back  \\nhere whether  it\\'s a child or an adult  now like the exterior  the interior  is a complete  departure  for a jagger  \\nif you have envisaged something wood and leather and the smell of cigars an old stale whiskey it\\'s  \\nnothing like that again it\\'s a modern interior it looks fresh even five years on in my book let\\'s start with  \\nthe driving position now the first thing I\\'ll say is I\\'ve now driven the eyepiece with all its seats if you like  \\nall the different seats you can have in it and this is the standard Sports seats and these are the ones I  \\nwould probably choose the you do get performance seats which w as in the car that we had last year  \\nwhen we put up against the ev6 from Kia and we\\'ve got that kind of One Piece backrest they\\'re good  \\nthey\\'re very nice I do like them but I do prefer these Sports seats they\\'ve got just a bit more adjustment  \\nyou can actually  adjust  the length  of the squab  electrically  to give you more  support  there  and they hold \\nyou just enough while still giving you that really nice kind of soft kind of coziting feel that you would  \\nexpect from something within the Jaguar badge you face thi s lovely three spoke sport steering wheel  \\nthat\\'s just just nice to hold it\\'s got the right kind of Garth to it\\'s the right diameter three spoke design  \\nlooks modern looks fresh you\\'ve got buttons on it which do look touch sensitive but they\\'re not you  \\nphysically got to press them to make it actually work and which is good as well which I like you\\'re  \\nstraight down into this driver\\'s Pinnacle which you can configure depending how you want it so I\\'ve got  \\nit set up with two dials and then in the middle you can h ave you can change the infotainment panel and  \\nit can either be a navigation it can be your driver assistance trip computer the media playing obviously  \\nback to navigation you can also have it so that you have um just maybe one dial in the center and then  \\nmedia and navigation up there or again more information about your trip as well so you can really  \\nconfigure the dashboard how you want it you move across here now and that was the biggest change  \\nsince 2018 I think it was in 2020 the card got the new Jaguar L and Rover pivy Pro system so you get  \\nthis 10 inch touchscreen display which is good it is it is it\\'s all right um you know it\\'s fairly quick to  \\nrespond it\\'s not the best in the class it\\'s not as good as BMW\\'s eighth generation operating system I  \\ndon\\'t  think  um Mercedes  is probably  a little bit better  as well but it\\'s certainly  not bad at all and it feels  of \\ngood quality and if you may be coming from I don\\'t know maybe a Range Rover Sport or something  \\nyou\\'re thinking about going all electric then a lot of that will be familiar to you you get standard Apple  \\ncarplay and Android auto as well which is Wireless talking to wireless that\\'s your wireless charging pad  \\ndown in there and then depending on the spec that you go for will depend on your climate control panel  \\nnow the specs are going to change for the 2024 facelift um this is a this is an older cost this is an HSE  \\nmodel and this has got the smaller five inch uh display here so you\\'ve got the climate control system  \\nwhich is down here now you can adjust your airflow with a touch screen and you can adjust the other  \\nsort of things with either touch sensor buttons around it or by these two rotary controllers which some  \\npeople  don\\'t  like but I absolutely  love once  you get used  to what  they do they work  really  really  well so if \\nyou don\\'t do anything with them you just literally turn them that is your temperature setting and it feels  \\nlike a nice bezel and a proper dive watch that\\'s what I like about it and just everything you touch the  \\nmaterials used just feel right anyway um and then if you push it that\\'s your seat control so you\\'ve either  \\ngot the ventilated seat if it\\'s on optioned on this car um or go to the right and that\\'s the heated seat and  \\nthen just release it and back to zero and then if you pull i t then that\\'s actually a fan speed so it really  \\nworks or you can just flick it to Auto or trying to claim it off or you can use the seat heating here on the  \\nscreen itself depending on what you want I think it works I like the fact it\\'s always there and once you  \\nget used to where the buttons on how to use it it\\'s actually quite easy to use on the move um  \\ntransmission control here so drive neutral reverse and park the opposite way around a lever would be  \\nparked reverse neutral drive but again just get used to  it and it\\'s fine and then you\\'ve got different  \\nbuttons  down  here depending  obviously  what  you want  so cruise  control  um which  obviously  it operates  \\nfrom up here as well and then your driving  modes  there  traction  control  off and then your air suspension  \\nadjustment is there so you can raise and lower the card as well if you\\'re going off -road with it storage is  \\ngood you get a little slot down in there two cup holders enough to take my big coffee flask and water  \\nbottle and then a center um copy in there you do also get a glove box of the car which is a decent size  \\nand decent  sized  door bins the other  thing  that\\'s  worth  mentioning  is the mirror  um so again  this has got \\nI think it\\'s called Clear Sight so you\\'ve either got it\\'s a bit like the little H onda East you\\'ve either got a  \\n\\nnormal mirror or if you flick it it now becomes the rear camera display so it\\'s showing you what\\'s right  \\nbehind your via camera and it works really well um despite where the camera is quite low down in the  \\ncar I come up the m6 they\\'re doing really grotty weather and it still stayed pretty clear I have to say um  \\nI\\'m not sure what I prefer whether I just prefer a normal mirror whether I prefer the camera view but at  \\nleast you\\'ve got the option of either or if you want but as I say the feeling of quality in he re is is  \\nsomething to be discussed because again I appreciate Jagger maybe haven\\'t had the best reputation  \\nwhen it comes to things like that but trust me when I tell you this this feels like a proper premium  \\nproduct  car um you\\'ve  got this lovely  kind of sort of like metal  um around  here which  feels  nice and cool \\nto the touch all the controls because I\\'ve got a nice solidity to them so when you press the buttons or  \\nuse the column stalks they click in a really nice way the materials around you know there\\'s not a cheap  \\nfeeling part you could maybe argue this like this little bit of plastic down here or the fact there\\'s a bit of  \\npiano black here and there which you can change by we can change that veneer is a little bit old heart  \\nand maybe it doesn\\'t like it isn\\'t as modern as you might want it to do but that would be it everything  \\nelse you know soft touch on the dash here and then there\\'s different kind of leather feeling up here and  \\nthen Alcantara roof lining and then they say everything you touch the door controls everything just has  \\na real proper more quality to it that I absolutely love with the Jagger the driving position is perfect you  \\ndon\\'t have that kind of tall elevated kind of SUV like driving um thing that you may be getting things like  \\nyou know like the IX or the odetron you sit low in the case in The Jug yo u\\'re not on it and it\\'s got a real  \\nsporty feel to the driving position which is good because you\\'ll see that when we drive the car it just  \\nfeels right and it just kind of feels like the whole car can envelops itself around you when you\\'re driving  \\nit and that\\'s quite nice because you\\'ve got these two kind of distinctly separate um you know driver and  \\nfront passenger kind of feel around like an open cockpit feel now some people do like that I prefer that  \\ncan a more individual side of it but I feel all the con trols are around me and so depending how you feel  \\nit might not be you but for me I think this works um and I think like the outside it\\'s one of Jagger\\'s best  \\ninteriors that they\\'ve ever done I think it\\'s a real Cork and as I say it\\'s the quote it\\'s the feeling of quality  \\nas well as that sort of real kind of design touch that\\'s abound in here it\\'s just the same as the outside  \\nand to me it still feels  as fresh  as as it did the day it was launched  five years  ago if there\\'s  one place  the \\neyepiece is maybe starting to feel its age it\\'s in its battery system now it\\'s a 90 kilowatt hour battery  \\nwhich is big and it should give according to wltp figures a range of 292 miles but its charging speed is  \\nonly 100 kilowatts meaning that if you\\'re going from your benchmark 10 to 80 percent it\\'s going to take  \\naround  about  45 minutes  now obviously  more  modern  cars such  as the BMW  IX Kia zv6 Hyundai  Sonic  \\n5. um two cars which you might also consider given price point which we\\'ll talk about later they\\'ve got  \\nmuch faster charging speeds Porsche taikan 800 volt architecture it charging speed is much much  \\nfaster so that is a bit of a downside with the eyepiece if you stumble across a more likely 50 kilowatt  \\ncharge and that takes that 10 to 80 Benchmark to about an hour and a quarter so there is that trade -off \\nto make  if you\\'re  charging  up from your home  seven  kilowatt  wall box and then you\\'re  looking  at around  \\nabout 13 hours  to go from Flat to full but from 2020  almost  Jagger  did fit an onboard  11 kilowatt  charger  \\na standard  to the car so if it\\'s that three -phase  electricity  and you\\'ve  got it home  then obviously  that time \\nwill drop down now I\\'ve quoted wltp figures again and I\\'m conscious I do quote that a lot so and I I  \\nshould really have recorded a bit more of the efficiency on my trip up here but let me give you a little  \\nsynopsis of my trip up um on Friday so it\\'s 350 miles give or take a couple of miles from my house to  \\nmy mother\\'s  house  and look at me from my house  and study  and to my mother\\'s  house  in Lockerbie  um \\nand I started with a battery level of around about 93 and it was shown about 200 and I think it was  \\nabout 232 miles and I charged twice on the way up to Scotland so once it\\'s Stafford and we\\'re uh the  \\nthe the Newbie pulse uh fast charges at Stafford Services North um and then again Porsche Center uh  \\nSouth Lakes and then arrived up in Lockerbie with more well I\\'d probably see how it was arrived in  \\nLockerbie with slightly less than 100 miles of rain showing so it\\'s pretty good i n terms of its efficiency  \\nconsidering the weight and the size of the car and also the fact that I was sitting on a Motorway cruise  \\ncontrol  on at around  about  17 miles  an hour mark  you know  air con on Bluetooth  music  playing  and just \\nconstantly on Motorway so it\\'s not bad In fairness um but as you see it\\'s probably the one area where  \\nwe need Jagger to maybe sort of like you know the next model that comes out whether it\\'s a new ipace  \\nor whether it\\'s the next generation of cars where I\\'d really like to see lik e that electric architecture move  \\ninto where more of the competition are certainly that we\\'ve seen from like Zakia Hyundai and Porsche  \\n\\nnow so are there any surprises for me know that I\\'m back buying the wheel of an eyepiece no um but  \\nthat\\'s a good thing because it\\'s always been a car that I\\'ve absolutely loved to drive and it\\'s a real  \\ndriver\\'s  car as you say I keep  kind of just you know  I can\\'t  get my hair during  this whole  SUV thing  when  \\nJack you say oh it\\'s an electric SUV and that\\'s kind of how they do marketing fairness but if you think of  \\nan SUV like a Land Rover Discovery or even things like the BMW IX Mercedes -Benz eqc 400 Audi  \\ne-tron that\\'s not the eyepiece it\\'s difficult to describe and it\\'s probably why I love the um Thai Kai cross  \\nTurismo so much because it\\'s a similar type of car it doesn\\'t feel like some big bulky thing it feels like  \\nsomething life something that\\'s a bit more Dynamic something that you can really take by the Scruff of  \\nthe neck and throw it down an Audi a drone and a BMW IX as good as they are would not see the way  \\non IPS when down a twisty Road they wouldn\\'t even know where it had gone now in terms of power  \\nwhen it came out back in 2018 it probably felt like 400 horsepower which is what the eyepiece has and  \\nstill has was a lot of power and in two intense purposes it is it\\'s not to 60 time is running about four and  \\na half seconds it is a fast car but it is so much more than just fast it\\'s the way in which it delivers the  \\npower it\\'s the way in which the car actually makes you feel as a driver have always had I mean grace  \\nspace and Pace was always the Mantra way back in the 60s and I don\\'t think there\\'s a jagger that that  \\nbetter applies to than the eyepiece if I\\'m honest with you because you\\'ve got quite a commodious car  \\num and because of its quietness because of its refinement it can be quite Cornish it sounds graceful  \\nand my gosh  it does  pick up at Scots  and goes  when  you need  it to let\\'s talk about  the driving  dynamics  \\nof it um from the driving seat so the first thing that you notice is the steering oh the first thing I sat on  \\nthis is the steering it is perfect it to me it is the perfect weight um of a steering it\\'s got a Precision to it  \\nthat I found lacking a lot of newer EVS it you know exactly where the front wheel is you go for an apex  \\nand an ipes and you can get a millimeter perfect as far as I\\'m concerned it\\'s got just the right amount of  \\nheft to it it\\'s not too heavy but and it\\'s just that you you pitch into a band  like this and it\\'s just that roll of  \\nthe wrist and there you\\'ve got it and you know exactly what the front wheels are doing so that\\'s the first  \\nthing that really speaks to me is the way the stealing acts with you it\\'s got a real kind of old -fashioned  \\nkind of mechanical  feel to it and it\\'s got a real kind of performance  car feel to it the the second  thing  that \\nreally grabs you when you\\'re driving the eyepiece is the suspension and the chassis Dynamics now  \\nchassis engineering to me is a dark art I sort of un derstand it in terms of what you have to try and  \\nAchieve could I do it myself absolutely no way and to me there are certain people that need to be held  \\nup on pedestals  when it  comes to  chassis Engineers  Richard Perry  Jones God  Rest his soul  Who \\nMade Who who engineered the first Mondeo he was one um Mike cross who did who did this he\\'s the  \\nother because he has got this spot on as far as I am concerned there is the right amount of feel coming  \\nfrom the chassis balanced with the right amount of comfort now I\\'m not saying that you don\\'t feel the  \\nbumps  you do it\\'s primary  right you know  exactly  what  the road surface  is like you could  put a pee down  \\non this road and I could drive over and I could tell you where it was but that doesn\\'t make it  \\nuncomfortab le it\\'s secondary ride the damper tuning on this car is phenomenal it doesn\\'t float it doesn\\'t  \\nbounce it just stays absolutely resolutely flat and as a driver you know exactly what is going on  \\nunderneath  you and the blend  of the performance  the steering  and that as far as I\\'m concerned  adds  up \\nto a car that is absolutely unsurpassed in its class if you class it just as those big SUVs you throw the  \\ntie can into the mixture and it\\'s another car the same as this it\\'s just got that blend that just for me feels  \\nright absolutely right um driving modes there\\'s three you get equal comfort and dynamic and that\\'s  \\ndown here um I don\\'t bother with Eco and anything like that you click it into dynamic and you put your  \\nfoot down and yes you can feel it of course you can as I say there\\'s that 400 horsepower is not a small  \\namount of power but kind of when you\\'ve got hot hatches that are kind of getting on that sort o f level  \\nnow and obviously with the added weight of an EV it\\'s not the startling figure that you get and see  \\nsomething like a BMW IX M60 and as much as I like the ixm60 and I do like it it doesn\\'t drive like this  \\nthis just kind of shrinks around you as a driver this kind of makes you feel like you\\'re really making stuff  \\nhappen and I just love it I really do I don\\'t think there\\'s another car in its class that comes even close to  \\nthe blend of abilities that the eyepiece has anyway there we go um so yeah so thr ee driving modes  \\ncomfort\\'s a nice one I\\'ve pretty much kept it Comfort on this trip to Scotland uh and  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2023 I -Pace  \\n\\n \\nReview:  \\n \\nwith jaguar choosing to skip the 2021 model year due to supply chain issues the 2022 ipay saw  \\nsignificant updates which are transferred into 2023. starting at 71 300 u.s or 99 800 canadian before  \\ndestination fees or tax credits these features are standard premium led lights up front 20 inch wheels  \\nwith a standard air suspension an all -new pivi pro infotainment system with over -the-air updates and  \\nstandard adaptive cruise control with searing assist pre -collision braking blind spot monitoring lane  \\nkeep assis t and a rear view camera with cross traffic alert just to name a few for 2023 the current  \\nstandard heads up display becomes optional a 360 degree surround view camera is available along  \\nwith a rear view digital mirror the current android auto and apple carplay connections become wireless  \\nand is complemented by standard wireless mobile charging with amazon alexa compatibility with  \\noptional wi -fi also unchanged from 2022 into 2023 is the power and available trim level which  \\nessentially is just one that being the hse trim however you do have the option of purchasing either a  \\nblack or bright exterior pack which adds either chrome or gloss accents to your eye pace in 2023 the  \\ni-pace is still going to be equipped with a 90 kilowatt hour battery pack 84.7 which is usable and it\\'s still  \\ngoing to produce 394 horsepower with 512 pound feet of torque and all -wheel drive continues to be  \\nstandard with no option of front wheel drive and when it comes to range stick with these standard 20  \\ninch wheels as opposed to the new 22 inch wheel option which will be offered in 2023 because jaguar  \\nestimates the 20s will allow you to reach up to 246 miles in 2023 with the optional 22 -inch wheels only  \\ndelivering an estimated 217 miles in range as for charging levels and times level one as per usual is  \\ngoing to be very slow even when aided by the 11 kilowatt on board charger but the on -board charger  \\ndoes help the i -pace recharge when plugged into a level 2 at -home charging unit or roadside tower  \\nspeaking  of level 2 charging  you can expect  up to 22 miles  of range  with a 60 minute  charge  or you can \\nfill up overnight at home within 10 hours level 3 however offers a dc fast charging connection and  \\njaguar has made a vast improvements to their fast charging capabilities now you can expect up to 78  \\nmiles of range with a 15 minute charge in 2023 a few i -pace competitors include the tesla model y the  \\nvolvo  xc40  recharge  mustang  maki  and genesis  of gv60  just to name  a few look down  in the description  \\nbelow for my real world charging times and c ompetitor battery range amounts two more features  \\naffecting range is braking regeneration and definitely driving mode so braking regeneration inside your  \\neye pace to activate it you have to go through your pivipro infotainment system when you do activate it  \\nnow you\\'ll have that opportunity to do one pedal driving and essentially that will allow you to come to a  \\nstop without using your brake pedal and that will also reduce wear and tear on your brakes braking  \\nregeneration essentially  is when  you are  lifting off  the accelerator  your battery  will recharge  itself \\nslightly then your driving modes will also impact your battery range significantly okay you are able to go  \\nfrom zero to 100 within 4.5 seconds inside your eye pace one dynamic mode is set up now personally  \\nin between eco mode and dynamic mode i experienced an 8 mile range difference in an instant when i  \\ngo between those two particular driving modes to switch your driving modes on the fly just use the  \\nbuttons located down here it\\'s really easy to do and then it will indicate through your digital  driver  \\ncluster what mode you\\'re in you have several different driving modes you have your eco you have your  \\ncomfort you have dynamic then you even have configurable dynamic and you also have rain snow and  \\nice if you\\'re an active individual or just an active family in general and towing capabilities is important to  \\nyou speak to your jaguar specialist before towing anything because currently within north america we  \\ndo not receive a tow rating with the i -pace w hereas european buyers you receive a tow rating of just  \\nover 1600 pounds jaguar does suggest that you\\'ll be able to store up to 165 pounds on top when your  \\neye pace is properly equipped now if a motion activated power liftgate is important to you speak to your  \\nspecialist because that\\'s valued at a hundred dollars as an option but your power liftgate is standard on  \\nyour ipace and you can use your key fob to pop it open you could also use your key fob to pop open  \\nyour front trunk  but then you\\'ll  have  to manua lly put it up from there  in terms  of cargo  capacity  you have  \\na cargo capacity of 25 to 51 cubic feet and the difference there is really determined by if you choose to  \\nkeep your seats up or down speaking about these seats these seats fold in a 40 20 40 split why i like  \\nthat is because if you are an active family you\\'ll be able to store longer items down the center and  \\n\\nremember i mentioned your eye pace is equipped with a standard air suspension so you can lower it  \\ndown making it easier to lift heavier items in i also recommend purchasing the optional rubber mats this  \\nwill just help keep everything cleaner and the standard cargo cover can also be easily stored beneath it  \\nso that\\'s super convenient when it does come to these seats the convenience can be improved  \\nbecause you have to manually put them down however you do have smaller hooks back here you do  \\nhave a 12 volt port and a strap for smaller items if you\\'re looking for additional storage space and your  \\nitems are small while underneath your floor trunk you can store smaller items there and you\\'ll also find  \\nyour tire mobility kit in 2023 you will have the option of a spare tire the jaguar i -pace is a five -seater suv  \\nbut it\\'s also a performance crossover meaning space back here can get a little bit tight but if you\\'re  \\nfamiliar with my channel you know i\\'m only five foot three so i never complain about lag or head space  \\nbut my producer who\\'s five foot eleven he fits just fine as well these rear seats are also heated if you  \\nprefer four zone climbing control that is an 800 option in relation to storage this is where it gets good so  \\nup front really good and then you have additional storage down the center and your front center  \\nconsole is amazing because the storage is so deep and then back here back here on the sides of the  \\ndoors it\\'s a little bit narrow but i like the fact that you have the storage behind the front seats but then  \\nyou have hidden storage for snacks and water bottles underneath your seat so that\\'s really good as  \\nwell for connectivity this is really really good i have zero complaints so your connectivity up front you\\'ll  \\nfind beside the front passenger leg you\\'ll find it inside your front center console and then rea r seat  \\npassengers enjoy two usb c ports and a 12 volt port then when it comes to this panoramic sunroof  \\nwhich is stunning and well tinted you have the option to purchase a sun blocker which you can  \\nmanually install and then take away as well when you want to uninstall your sun shade well then you  \\ncan just store it inside your trunk underneath your floor mats jaguar suggests that they offer the best  \\nin-class  warranty  coverage  through  their elite care program  i\\'ll provide  that information  down  below  now \\nthese  seats  are both heated  ventilated  power  operated  offer lumbar  support  and thigh  support  they also \\nhave memory functions as well on either side this steering wheel is also heated but if you prefer a  \\nheated steering wheel you have to speak to your jaguar specialist because that\\'s part of the cold  \\nweather package the rest of this wheel is just amazing it fits your hands comfortably and offers great  \\ncharacter on the left hand side you\\'re going to find your voice commands and your bluetooth you\\'ll also  \\nhave your button for your meridian audio sound system which is fantastic also your digital driver cluster  \\nis just that it\\'s fully digital you can operate and adjust a lot of your safety features using your digital  \\ndriver cluster so for example if you don\\'t like your heads up display well you can just deactivate it but  \\nwhen you deactivate it and you\\'re also using it for your navigation system well then you can switch your  \\ndigital driver cluster to display a 3d version of your mapping it looks really good and remember the  \\nheads up display is only an option for 2023 on the right hand side this is where you\\'ll find your adaptive  \\ncruise control settings in the eye pace it\\'s semi -autonomous for about 15 seconds and then you\\'ll have  \\nto hold the steering wheel again just touch it for a moment it senses that you\\'re there and then it will be  \\nautonomous again one of the standout features from this past week is this pivi pro infotainment system  \\nit\\'s so easy  to use so it\\'s a touch  screen  and a swipe  through  i recommend  when  you sit down  with your \\njaguar specialist ask them about the shortcuts so there\\'s a gear icon on your rig ht hand side or a four  \\nsquare icon on your left hand side you push that and a lot of those features that you\\'re going to need  \\ndaily for example like knowing what\\'s going on with your battery range is all right there or if you don\\'t  \\nwant to look to your right it\\'s always going to be displayed inside your digital driver cluster but that\\'s  \\nwhat  i recommend  is sitting  down  going  through  those  two icons  when  you do push  the gear icon on the \\nright hand side it\\'s going to come up with four additional options for a screen so push the all word and  \\nthen that\\'s where you\\'ll be able to customize a lot of the features that\\'s going on with your eye pace but  \\nlike i said it\\'s easy now for your climbing controls very similar to what i experienced in the land rover  \\nthese knobs are multi -functional so if you pull them out they do one function when you push them in  \\nthey do another  and then you can turn everything  on and off by using  the small  digital  screen  remember  \\ni mentioned those driving modes i told you they\\'re located here on the right hand side so choose the  \\nfeature that you like or i should say the driving mode you like which is dynamic for me then foot on  \\nbrake push the d for drive now let\\'s hit the road so here\\'s a fastback for you your jaguar i -pace like i  \\nmentioned comes equipped with a standard air suspension but when you\\'re traveling at over 65 miles  \\nan hour or above it automatically lowers itself by 0.4 inches reducing drag and improving range  \\n\\nefficiency so that\\'s really nice and that\\'s what my week with the i -pace has been all about really nice  \\ncomfortable smooth and premium premium quality the finish of it has just been really nice and i like the  \\nupdates jaguar has made to the infotainment system because it really is easy to use and the navigation  \\nsystem  i love the fact when  i put in a destination  it automatically  calculates  how much  range  i\\'ll still have  \\nwhen i get to my destination so that\\'s nice and it gives you so many options with different charging  \\npoints too and it even tells you what type of connector and how many connectors or i should say  \\ncharging  towers  are at that particular  location  so that\\'s  fantastic  because  that makes  it really  convenient  \\nand takes the the guessing out of it you know like how many charging towers are there what\\'s available  \\nall that stuff so all that is taken away but the driving modes 100 if you enjoy going back and forth  \\nbetween  eco or dynamic  that will change  your range  by a lot so pay attention  to that it really  didn\\'t  make  \\nmuch of a change when i use you know like my audio and my climbing control that really didn\\'t matter  \\ntoo much but overall the sound quality is fantastic it\\'s so quiet i love the braking regen in here i like how  \\nthey did it\\'s not overly aggressive visibility out the front the sides there\\'s no blind spot out that third  \\nwindow the one thing i would change is probably this panoramic sunroof so i love it because it\\'s huge  \\nbut i like more the feature inside the bmw ix where it\\'s like one touch to expose and one t ouch to shade  \\nin the jaguar they do probably a better job with their standard tint but i don\\'t like the manual shade but  \\nit\\'s an option right but what i like to do in all my videos is recommend a test drive because test drives  \\nare complementary so guys look down in the description below because i try to make your purchasing  \\nexperience easy for you but for now i\\'m julianna your automotive woman make sure you subscribe and  \\nhit that notification bell so you don\\'t miss how to tuesday or future car friday thanks  for watching guys  \\n[Music] you  \\n \\nCar Model: Jaguar 2023 I -Pace  \\nReview:  \\nhey what\\'s up guys it\\'s techsumer talking to you here and in today\\'s video I want to review the Jaguar  \\nEV you see standing behind me yes this has been my daily car for the last year and in 2023 I want to  \\nreview it because we got tons of competition for this car we got the model y got the new Audi e -tron Q8  \\nwe got so many SUVs on the market the Kia ev6 even the Hyundai ioniq five so many cars that you  \\nhave on the market right now that can compete with Jaguars EV this was the first easy on the market  \\nthis car  came out in 2017. can you believe it 2017. this was one of the first EVS to hit the market but in  \\nmy opinion it\\'s still one of the best this tiny SUV which is not that tiny has about 400 horsepower and  \\ncan deliver 0 to 100 in about 4.6 seconds it has tons of space on the boot on the front on the back it\\'s  \\nsuper practical and in my opinion it\\'s one of the most fun EVS to drive I\\'ve drove tons of Tesla\\'s Model  \\nS model X model 3s model wise and even the Kia ev6 that are on F5 and I can tell you that this Jagu ar \\nEV feels  like a Jaguar  when  you drive  it so of course  in today\\'s  video  I want  to review  it show  you all the \\nquirks and features tag Dr Muro and of course tell you if it\\'s worth it to buy or not in 2023 so if you are  \\nexcited this video will have tons of drone shots it will be exciting different video for me but I love making  \\ncar videos so if you do also don\\'t forget to drop back down below and subscribe to my channel let\\'s get  \\nstarted so let\\'s first start by the looks of this car and as you can see now behind me this car is not top  \\npicked or tiny it\\'s normal I do believe that the looks of this car are in that poin t where it looks like an EV  \\nbut it also looks good it\\'s not that weird looking AV but it\\'s also not that bad I do believe that the Jaguar  \\ni-pace although it\\'s 5 years old or 6 years older design it looks insanely cool still in 2023 let\\'s take a  \\nwalk behind it and see if you like it or not and also inspect the quality of the manufacturing because  \\ntens of EVS nowadays have this problem especially Teslas let\\'s go check it out so we can start here  \\nfrom the front as you can see we have these nice wheels these ni ce rims which are from the factory  \\nactually this is not no third -party upgrade this is from the factory one of my favorite wheels on this car  \\nand here on the front you can see I have this very weird but very aerodynamic shaped design it\\'s in my  \\nopinion one of the best looking EVS on the market I actually love this design and you can see already  \\nthe protruding door handles and of course the charging ports going along your hand you can see that  \\n\\nyou have the Jaguar EV of course there and yes this is a Jaguar like other Jaguars looks amazing I  \\nlove it so so much then also of course we have this other rim and door handle we which looks really  \\ncool this pops out and reveals the back which extends on Space you can see there but let\\'s not get  \\ninside right now and talk about more of the design on the exterior the rims are cool like I told you let me  \\ngo into the back which is also one of the more controversial parts of this Jaguar EV but in my opinion  \\none of the best parts that make it look so so cool you have the i -pace logo and the ev400 tagging the  \\n400 horsepower that you have on this car insane insane performance later on I will open the boot to  \\nshow you how good and how special it is you have these very cool detail that you can see here on the  \\nback goes along of the back wow love it this car is so good looking I love driving around and for the  \\nprice that it is which is around seventy thousand dollars I think it\\'s a pretty good buy this side is about  \\nthe same you have these tires these wheels and again the Jaguar EV on the side and no port on this  \\nside just like the Audi each one that has two boards the Porsche icon this card only has on the port on  \\nthe left side it uses CCS you also have this weird opening here that you can see on the front and this is  \\nfor air intake so the air comes through and improves very very much the aerodynamic of this car  \\nbecause the air comes from these fenders you can see from the side here this Fender comes  \\ndownwards and from this Fender the fenders go the air goes to the side of these fenders like so and  \\nthen comes upwards here this improves very much aerodynamic because it\\'s a pass for the hair to  \\npush  through  and saves  on efficiency  and gives  this car with 400 horsepower  and an 80 kilowatt  battery  \\ngives it around 450 kilometers of range which translates to about almost 300 miles or 270 miles on  \\nMiles so let\\'s now talk about one of the best features that this car has and many other cars don\\'t have  \\nwhich is the Frank yes this car has a front and and it\\'s so weird because nowadays most of the EVS  \\nhave things on the on the front and this car has a front which is very useful when you want to carry  \\nthings around you can see that I popped it and then if I have to lift i t up it\\'s not easy to lift it up and you  \\nhave to find the place where there\\'s the handle let me see what it is oh yeah I found it so you have to  \\nfound find it like it\\'s not easy oh here it is and then push it up and reveals the front as you can see not  \\nthe biggest but when you reveal it like like so it\\'s not that bad jumping in you can have your charging  \\ncables you can see a reference to my hand like it\\'s not bad I think it has around 50 liters of space you  \\nhave the manual there but it\\'s actually Jaguar you  have the fluids there and other things that I don\\'t  \\nknow  what  it is and you just come  here pick it up like so and you have  to actually  put it with a lot of force  \\nlisten  to this yep that\\'s  it that\\'s  the front of the Jaguar  EV again  like I told you these  headlights  are pretty  \\ncool I think they are they are Matrix but I\\'m not sure this car has a lot of Base things because it was  \\ncheap he says it\\'s not like the base model but it doesn\\'t have much much extras but again the the they  \\nare LEDs so I don\\'t think they are that bad and we have the windscreen wipers the view of the front this  \\ncar is very very aggressive and the air like I told you goes upwards and behind that that of course roof  \\nthis roof is panoramic so you can look at it and it looks pretty co ol from the air and of course it\\'s like  \\nwhen you are at night or when you are driving you can book up and see all the stars all the things  \\nabove you as for the charging I think this is the worst part of this car again this car only charges at 11  \\nkilowatts with the non -fast charger so the AC charger this one right here and they have the DC charger  \\nwhich only charges at 100 kilowatts so zero to eight eighty percent I think in about 45 minutes and zero  \\nto 100 in about one hour not the best part about the jagua r i-pace in my opinion but let\\'s not complain  \\nabout this I think this is the worst part in the most delayed part that maybe needs an upgrade from  \\nJaguar but I think it\\'s quite enough if you don\\'t do any type of DC charging if you only do AC charging  \\nthis will charge  overnight  no problem  whatsoever  then again  this car has these  handles  which  are pretty  \\ncool because you can open them like so and they work like normally but if you close it and you close  \\nthe car take a look at these handles which will close automatically pretty pretty cool in my opinion and  \\nthey all do it at the same time you open them they push out you close them they push in very very  \\nuseful and also improves aerodynamically so very important to have those on this car again these  \\nwheels are I think 20 inch wheels I\\'m not sure but you can see they have these Goodyear tires they  \\nlook pretty cool they have the Jaguar symbol there brakes these are steel brakes then this car has  \\nregen braking and you can turn on only one pedal driving works very well in my opinion one of the best  \\nfeatures of EVS are one pedal driving again it says relatively braking and it works and it charges a lot  \\nyour battery it\\'s actually very strong when you can actually change the settings you can put it very  \\nstrong very mild or mild this car again is very strong when you put at its maximum setting very cool in  \\n\\nmy opinion love them again let\\'s now talk about the  boots which has about 557 liters which okay this  \\ncar is close sorry again it\\'s huge I have tons of stuff here in my jacket drones backpack again 500 and  \\n57 liters again I think you don\\'t have anything to complain about the practicality of this soup you have  \\nthis 12 volt socket here if you want to change your charger appliances again you have this fourth floor  \\nhere which I can try to open and you have I think a spare tire or something like that more storage  there  \\nyou can put your charging cables have these straps here to trap something if you need to and you can  \\nfold down the seats this is hatchback again so I can see the this can close down and to close this very  \\neasy you just click it and again it closes this car very very practical like I was telling you so let\\'s get now  \\ninto inside and see how much space you have in the back let\\'s enter the back of this car and see how  \\nmuch space we have I\\'m again five seven two five eight and you can see that I have tons  of Lightroom  \\nthis is my driving position so in terms of my leg room it\\'s a lot and in terms of have room let\\'s see how  \\nmuch it is like here\\'s the panoramic room that I was talking about and again let\\'s see how much space  \\ndo I have  in my head  so as you can see I\\'m seated  here and this is how much  space  do I have  between  \\nmy head and the ceiling the ceiling is glass so gives you extra space very cool and I think in the back  \\nthe only problem  that I have  the whole  issue  that I have  it\\'s one and it\\'s very simple  because  the battery  \\nis on around the floor of this car your feet are a little bit elevated upwards other than that works well in  \\nmy opinion very comfortable car to ride on the back but what Mars is in the front let\\'s get into the front  \\nshall we let\\'s not leave the back of the car go into the front which is most importan t part sorry for the  \\nnoise a lot of motorcycles here what jackasses they are they are making noises because I\\'m making a  \\nvideo sorry about that nothing I can do we are in the front of this car and as you can see this place  \\neverywhere you have the driver\\'s display and you have this display driver\\'s display is very important  \\nbecause Tesla Model y Tesla Model 3 don\\'t have driver\\'s display and this this is a very good driver  \\ndisplay this is the main display though where all the fun happens and this is the third  display where you  \\ncan have your AC with these dials I will turn on the car for you to see if this plays on and again these  \\nhave these displays this shows you the speed zero to 240 again this car is limited to 220 kilometers per  \\nhour you have your actual range right now I have about 75 percent with 220 kilometers and then you  \\nhave the power the regen the kilometers you can change all these menus they are customizable you  \\ncan put the maps  there  there\\'s  tons of space  you have  all of these  buttons  in the steering  to change  the \\nvolume of the car you can see there I I probably cannot see I think you can see you change the volume  \\nof the the music here this is to set and change the speed of the limiter and of course cruise control  \\naccept calls make calls your driver\\'s assistance and the menu button or the special button for you to  \\nchange some things here you can change your driving so you know we are in park you can put it in  \\ndrive you can put it in reverse or neutral in here you change your driving bike you go  into sport you go  \\ninto Eco I don\\'t  know  you can just click here as you can see there  it will change  now we are in Comfort  I \\ncan put it on sport or dynamic and I can put it a comfort again and and Eco I don\\'t drive in Eco I drive  \\nmost  of my time in Comfort  most  comfortable  setting  for this inspection  for the AC and the driving  range  \\nis more than enough again this display is all the fun where  it happens you have carplay right now it\\'s  \\nnot connected because I\\'m filming this video I cannot have it connected you have wireless carplay  \\nwired carplay and you have Bluetooth and Wi -Fi connections this system though is actually very good  \\nvery responsive and it\\'s touch just like so very easy all those menu settings are here and very easy to  \\nuse you have this dia l so very common very normal for people that like to change sound and improve  \\nthose things you also have the AC the AC dials work very well because you can push them up and  \\nchange all these settings like one two three the levels of the intensity of the fan and you can push it  \\ndown for example let me turn it off now it\\'s off and if you turn this like is the fan again push it up again  \\noh sorry  you can you have  to press  it and now you\\'re  going  to the temperature  so you push  it up you go \\ninto the fence  you can change  the fan speed  of the AC I want  to turn it off I don\\'t  need  it and then I push  \\nit down and I give it the temperature now we have the temperature and I can set it wherever I want to  \\nit\\'s taking a while I don\\'t know why I think it\\'s because it\\'s off you have to turn it on now you can change  \\nthe temperature like 20 20.5 21 this is of course Celsius you can change yours to Fahrenheit if you  \\nwant to I don\\'t like to use AC right now it\\'s getting dark outside don\\'t need it we are in the golden hour  \\nright now I think it\\'s the perfect time to film this video like I told you these are the driver settings and I  \\nalso have tons of space here I have my mic charging there this is huge like you can put my hand down  \\nthere you can see it\\'s big you also have these two cup holders this place where you put your  \\n\\nsunglasses your keys you also have this space here for you to put things up then you have the glove  \\nbox here very manual all of these are manual none no display settings those like these like Tesla thank  \\nGod then you close  these  up you have  this premium  materials  like right here these  are soft you can see \\nthat they are soft and now you also have this piano black that gets very smudged up I\\'m always  \\ncleaning it then on top of here all the materials also very premium and every single thing feels very  \\ngood even the steering wheel looks very good good and feels very good like I told you this is the jaguar  \\nloves to drive this is such a fun car to have and he also the Sun System you have this Meridian South  \\nsystem and it\\'s good it\\'s not perfect but it\\'s not bad overall so what do you tell me if we go into a drive  \\nand talk about the driving performance of his car shall we so we are now driving this car and what I can  \\ntell about  this car is about  the performance  this car has about  400 horsepower  and can do 0-100 or 0 to \\n60 miles per hour in about 4.6 4.5 seconds on a good day this is a four wheel drive car so has tons of  \\ntraction and is very very fast I think that driving a Jaguar is all about performance and when you talk  \\nabout performance you  always consider  consider that  an EV  has tons  of braking power  or horsepowe r \\nit can launch very fast but around corners because of its weight the way that the battery works it\\'s  \\nactually very heavy and it\\'s not that very good to drive it might be I\\'ve driven Teslas they are cool but  \\nokay they have a good gravity strong pull because like they have they are very heavy but when you  \\nstart driving them like you feel like again sorry for the I have to put the seat belt on if they will this will  \\nnot shut up but again driving this car is something that you will not regret after like the 1 0th the five or  \\nfirst five seconds because it\\'s extremely fun to drive on very tight Corners it\\'s very grippy the car feels  \\nlike it\\'s a performance  car the suspension  is tough  yes it is it\\'s tough  I cannot  tell you that it\\'s not it\\'s like \\nan EV that is heavy as a Turf suspension and when you grip it around corners it\\'s just close and when  \\nyou push this pedal especially on performance mode is very very fast what can I tell you this is a good  \\ncar to drive very comfortable I think that after a while you will notice they\\'re driving a car it\\'s all about  \\nOne comfort then performance and then then it comes practicality I think that if the car is not  \\ncomfortable to drive you will not even drive it and an EV especially good at it it\\'s very silent you  cannot  \\nhear any road noise can you hear a very small whining from the motors if I push the car a little bit like  \\ncan you hear it I don\\'t know if you can but it\\'s audible if you were in the car with me then again this car  \\nis just so much fun to drive around corners it\\'s a Jaguar you will feel like this car is connected to the  \\nroad and because of the heavy weight on the battery we\\'ll feel that you have tons of traction and varies  \\nvery good  safety  but of course  you can go into off-road right now like I\\'m going right now in Whole  Food  \\nso like I was telling you this car can off -road and very very well again this is a four wheel drive car and  \\nit\\'s a car that can go through mud water has tons of features to do so again this is a Jaguar which is on  \\npartnership with vanro Land Rover and Range Rover so you can turn on modes to to actually go  \\noff-road this is a very cool car to do so like I told you and I think it\\'s a very completely although it\\'s from  \\n2017 does not feel like a 2017 car does not drive like a 2017 car it\\'s fast it\\'s very reliable the range is  \\nvery accurate I can get 400 kilometers 450 kilometers out of this car very easily and again that\\'s  \\nsomething that is not usual these days EVS normally have very poor range they give you like oh you  \\ncan do 500 kilometers but then ends up doing like I don\\'t know 450 400 kilometers and this car  no tells  \\nyou I can do 450 kilometers  or even  400 kilometers  what  does  it do 400 kilometers  and that\\'s  one of the \\nmost  things  that I appreciate  on the car is when  it tells you the truth the brain  tells the truth and this card \\ndrives like a Jaguar which has not lost his soul so if you are worried about this car not driving so well  \\nagain this is a Jaguar don\\'t be worried about that again this car drives like a dream very very very very  \\nvery fast again it\\'s an EV and I think in my opinion I prefer this car a lot to a Tesla driving doesn\\'t  \\nmodelize is faster yes even the model 3 is faster but they are not better drivers than this one so if you  \\nlike Jaguars like the Jaguar EV go for it into i23 at least for driving I think again take  one last big look at  \\nthis car and this design is insane I love it so so much it has so many features that I enjoy from the door  \\nhandles the wheels the way that is shaped from the back to the front and of course the mirrors all the  \\ntechnology the 400 horsepower 0 to 60 in about 4.6 seconds what\\'s not to like about this car but of  \\ncourse the final question on today\\'s video is should you buy it in 2023 for 70 000 when you have the  \\nTesla  Model  Y when  you have  the Kia ev6 so many  things  that can actually  influe nce your decision  but I \\nneed  to tell you if you like to drive  fast cars very very well very well performing  cars when  driving  around  \\nlike a very very focused performance vehicle then the Jaguar i -pace to see you but let me know in the  \\ncomments  below  what  you think  do you like the Jaguar  Pace  or not so this has been  it this has been  my \\n\\nreview of the jaguar i -pace in 2033 I totally recommend this car you have 400 horsepower 450  \\nkilometers of range around 270 miles of range you have tons of space very practical a very very  \\nfocused performance vehicle very comfortable the suspension is a little bit tough but it\\'s a Jaguar \\nwhat  can you expect and of course there\\'s the plus that the interior is very very premium filling so \\nwhat I  recommend you buying a jaguar i -pace in 2023 well I gotta tell you this car has been in my \\nhands for  about one year  and it\\'s a very special experience when you first get in Jaguar it\\'s very \\npremium very  very fast very very focused in performance but does not let go of all of the things that \\nyou actually love  like the Comfort like the practicality of having a very cool Booth no you have all of \\nthat on top of the  performance the horsepower and the range the only thing that I don\\'t like  about \\nthis car again is the  way that it charges charges only at 100 kilowatts at fast charging so if you are \\ndoing very big road trips  more than like 300 kilometers you\\'re almost screwed because you cannot \\ncharge very fast and you will  spend tons of time on the fast charging but again you cannot have \\neverything if you want just a car to  run around  town  to ride around  back  at 300 kilometer  range  then \\nthe Jaguar  i-pace  so you if you want  a better range DV there are other options like the Kia ev6 the \\nTesla Model y but I don\\'t think they are as  cool as a Jaguar i -pace very premium very focused on \\nperform months after all is a jaguar or not then  of course if you like this video don\\'t forget to drop \\nback down below and subscribe the channel and tell  me on the comments which is your favorite TV \\nand have you ever driven an EV car if not then go test  drive one I think you\\'ll fall in line with one but \\nof course this has been Texoma talking sho w here follow  my social networks Instagram Twitter bye

      "The performance of the 2023 BMW 320i is impressive. It is equipped with a two-liter four-cylinder turbo petrol engine that produces 135 kilowatts of power and 300 newton meters of torque. This engine provides a satisfying level of speed and acceleration, with a 0 to 100 kilometers per hour time of 7.4 seconds. In terms of fuel efficiency, it achieves a combined cycle fuel economy of 6.5 liters per 100 kilometers. The power is efficiently transmitted to the rear wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission.\n",

      "Jaguar cars offer several unique features. One of these is their distinctive design, with the 2021 F-Pace showcasing a redesigned front end that includes double LED lights and a honeycomb grille. Another unique feature is the advanced infotainment system, such as the Pivi Pro system, which provides a clear display and is compatible with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Jaguar cars also come equipped with a range of advanced driver-assistance features, including steering assist, a head-up display, and a clear view rearview mirror system. Additionally, customers have the option to choose from a variety of engine options, ranging from a two-liter turbocharged inline-four to a five-liter supercharged V8, allowing them to select the performance that best suits their preferences.\n",
      "The infotainment system in the Jaguar F-Pace 2022 has undergone updates, but it still has some drawbacks. The system features small icons and multiple submenus, which can make it poorly structured and difficult to navigate. However, if you utilize Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, which are compatible with the system, you can bypass some of these challenges. While the infotainment system is often considered the weakest aspect of the car, it does not detract from the overall excellence of the Jaguar F-Pace 2022.\n",
      "To keep your BMW 320i in good condition, here are some maintenance tips:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Follow the recommended service schedule: BMW provides a service schedule for each model, including the 320i. It is important to adhere to this schedule and have your car serviced at the recommended intervals. Since the 2023 BMW 320i has condition-based servicing intervals, the car will notify you when it needs to be serviced.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Regularly check and change fluids: Keep an eye on the oil, coolant, brake fluid, and other fluids in your BMW 320i. The car's monitoring system will alert you if any of the fluids are low or need to be changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Monitor tire pressure and tread: Regularly check the tire pressure using the car's monitoring system and ensure it is at the recommended level. Also, inspect the tire tread for any signs of wear and replace the tires if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Replace filters and spark plugs: It is important to regularly replace the air filter, fuel filter, and cabin air filter in your BMW 320i. Additionally, check the spark plugs and replace them if they are worn out. The car's monitoring system will also alert you if any of these components need to be replaced.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Maintain the battery: Keep the battery terminals clean and free from corrosion. The car's monitoring system will notify you if the battery needs to be replaced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, these are general maintenance tips and it is always recommended to consult your BMW owner's manual for specific guidelines and recommendations.\n",
      "The common reliability issues reported for the 2023 BMW 320i are not mentioned in the given context.\n",
      "There are no common complaints about the interior space or comfort level in the Mini Countryman 2021 mentioned in the new context.\n",
      "The reviews for the 2022 BMW 320i have highlighted some performance limitations. The reviewers have mentioned that the car's power output may not feel particularly strong in the higher rev range compared to more powerful variants like the 330i. Additionally, the ride quality of the 320i may feel slightly stiff-legged and brittle over certain bumps, especially when compared to other BMW models. However, these limitations are not considered significant and do not significantly impact the overall driving experience.\n"
